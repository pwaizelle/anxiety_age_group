Abstract

Background
Anxiety complaints have been on the rise since COVID-19 but with little change in the number of providers available, it is difficult to conduct anxiety screening efficiently. To seek relief, advice, or community, people often turn to using social media. Because these social media posts often detail anxiety concerns, they may be a source of information to understand anxiety-related mental health needs. 

Objective
On social media individuals experiencing health and wellbeing concerns, such as anxiety, publish support-seeking posts. Prior work determined that on social media, individuals who express feeling lonely seek different types of support that further vary by age group, and individuals who seek support on online loneliness forums also seek loneliness-related support (around the same time period) in general and depression forums. Anxiety concerns may or may not follow a similar pattern of cross-posting that varies by age.

Methods
The dataset used in this work consists of posts published on online anxiety and general (focused on asking general questions) forums, respectively by individuals belonging to different age groups. Using these datasets, we conduct analyses in which we use a large language model to extract the anxiety related concerns expressed in posts published on the online anxiety-related forum and the online general forum, respectively. We then conduct analyses to determine if the anxiety-related concerns expressed in posts published on the online anxiety forum and general forum varied significantly by age group.
