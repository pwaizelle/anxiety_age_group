"This is a X-post from /r/hypertension but I feel like it also relates to this sub.
  
 

  I'm 38 (5'9"", 188lbs) and over the last year I've seemed to be trending toward hypertension (it's in my my family history: dad's side). My avg. blood pressure is around 135-145. I'm active (play badminton, work out with weights, run and surf multiple times a week) and am not taking any medication. Here's the thing. I live in a foreign country where there aren't a lot of opportunities to make money. The best and by far, most lucrative, is to volunteer for clinical trials for new medications.
  
 

  These are competitive and really strict with the ranges they set for who gets allowed in. In years past, I had no trouble with blood pressure, but one time I was accepted into a trial and was late (this risks losing my spot and all the money) so I hopped into a taxi, but when I got there my blood pressure was 170 and I was sent home.
  
 

  Ever since that time, my body developed a fear of that machine and in every medical trial I've tried for since it's always been an issue, costing me so many opportunities to raise my income. I say, my body did, because there are no racing thoughts or even internal worries that are biting at me for instance, but my body just knows, gets tense, and prickles with nervousness, despite whatever I try to do to relax or soothe myself.
  
 

  I've tried buying my own blood pressure machine (exposure therapy) and going to get my blood pressure checked at local offices but it isn't the same exact context, so it hasn't seemed to help.
  
 

  I've also tried the panic attack breathing interventions (closed-nostril breathing, patterned breathing) but I'm not really having a panic attack, so they didn't seem to have an effect.
  
 

  Gulping as much oxygen as I can in 5 minutes to trip the parasympathetic and induce a sleepy state worked once but not the last time; still it's the best result I've seen so far. Plus, I'm already on a diet of 1500mg salt, composed of mostly veggies and fruits.
  
 

  I wanted to ask if anyone in the community has discovered a trick that can lower your anxiety and hopefully, in turn, blood pressure when you are in an anxiety-provoking situation. Like I said it doesn't feel like a head problem, internally, I know there's nothing to worry about, but something beyond my thoughts tends to just react in that setting, as if my body is having thoughts of its own. I have the same thing with public speaking, I wouldn't say I have any fear of it that I'm cognizant of, but my body definitely does.
  
 

  Thanks for reading, any advice would be appreciated."
"Having a hard time at the thought of learning to drive to the point that its making my feet and rest of my body sweat. I want to learn but don't want to learn just to be forced to work and take on more responsibility at work if you get what I'm saying. I need to conquer my fears but they seem to be getting worse, not better."

"I (F40) have suffered from panic disorder since I was a young child. I’m currently trying to buy a house with my partner, but every time we make an offer or have one accepted I start having horrendous panics attacks. I take Propanalol which helps a bit, but because of other health conditions I’m limited to what meds I can take.
  Can anyone suggest anything beyond the standard coping mechanisms to help me get through to the end of the process without withdrawing from the purchase because I can’t cope?
  Thanks"
"Sorry, but this is probably going to be long.
  
 

  Just to start off with a little bit of background: A close friend of mine recently mentioned to me that I may as well be the Doctor. I have companions, I have a blue car... And I wear sunglasses a lot. Not that mine are sonic, though. She mentioned this mainly because I pretty much only have one close friend at a time. Oddly enough, as soon as one friend leaves, it doesn't take long for another person to cross my path whom I have an instant connection with. Ofc, things change in life, so people come and go all the time. That didn't used to bother me. But, after some events that occurred in the past five years, it does now.  
  
 

  I don't let myself get close to very many people but, every so often, someone manages to slip in. Like the one who brought up the doctor. We had been close before the pandemic started, but right after the start of the pandemic she disappeared for a few years. She just came back in the past two weeks. Right about the time she and I had stopped talking, though, another person whom I had known for awhile contacted me, and it didn't take long for us to talk quite frequently. It was to the point where I considered her to be my best friend. That's something I hadn't called anyone since I was a child. I'm 40 now. For nearly a year and a half we would text daily, talk on the phone a few times a week, and we spoke about everything. Then, 5 months ago, she stopped talking to me. She eventually told me it was because of her new boyfriend who had trust issues. We haven't spoken since.
  
 

  My therapist had noted a couple months ago that I was distancing myself from just about everyone in my life. She said it was understandable, but not really healthy. That's when another friend started to engage with me more, and we grew to be fairly close friends. But, ofc, a couple weeks ago, she stopped talking to me. I just found out today that was because she had received a job offer in a major city in another state, and had a lot of things to deal with because of it. At first I was happy for her because it's such an amazing opportunity. It didn't take long for me to start spiraling, though. Even though she told me she didn't take the job. I haven't felt anxiety like this in a long time.
  
 

  I'm tired of letting people in only to end up having to say goodbye. I've already lost enough, that I don't know if I can handle losing anyone else. Especially since I don't have hardly anyone else in my life. To top it all off, I also recently lost my job and, because of lack of funds, I've had to stop therapy. Which is why I decided I post here. Thank you to anyone who made it this far."
"Hi everyone! I’m a 35F who has anxiety, adhd, and depression. I’m kinda in a jam. I’m currently employed at like the Saks Fifth version of my industry, but I’ve been stagnant and making roughly 60k as a operations specialist. The company has amazing benefits and I’m good at what I do. However, life is getting more and more expensive and when asked if I can be promoted since I’ve been taking on more supervisor-like tasks, I’m told no. I also found out through someone who left that my job will be eventually be moved to another state for cheaper labor. I would most likely lose my job. 
  
 

  One of my friend (50F) is offering me a quality and training manager title which would be bump me to 80k. Benefits are meh. The company would be like a JC Penny version and a totally different industry. Not even an industry that I would be necessarily interesting nor would ever associate myself in. I’ve only worked in companies that felt meaningful and to improve the world or help people. 
  
 

  I honestly don’t know what to do, and my anxiety has been crippling. I have to make a decision ASAP and I can’t decide. My friend says that this can be a launch pad to get me motivated again to look else where while making more money and getting experience and mentorship from her since she coaches her employees as well to improve their lives and positions. I’ve just been so depressed and anxiety that my default is to do nothing and stay where I am. I’ve done this with a cat purchase and returned the vehicle as well as other life decisions. I feel insecure and just need support. My friend is aware of my mental health and said she wouldn’t let me fall. 
  
 

  What should I do 🥺"
"39M in Los Angeles. I am diagnosed ocd and have some health anxiety. The pandemic was hard. We lost my mother in law as well as family pet. My parents almost succumbed to Covid but survived. My wife and I endured two early stage miscarriages at the onset. We are in California and it’s intense. 4 and 7 year old kids (2/5 at onset of pandemic). 
  I run a large business. Business is booming. Struggling to keep head over water. 
  
 

  In May I started twitching. Google was bad to me. ALS scared me to death. Then panic attacks. And insomnia. Once ALS was ruled out, I was pointed towards another unsolvable disease - vaccine injury. I’ve spent the last 9 months panicking regularly. And twitching almost constantly. B12 and antihistamines seem to help me. Like a MCAS storm. But at the same time, I can’t help but think some (or all) of this is my anxiety. My need for certainty. My burnout from work. My panic from pandemic that I held in for two years to provide for my family. My unending grief from the losses. 
  I’ve been seeing therapist for the last 7 months. But not doing CBT. Just talk therapy and I just started EMDR last month to resolve old trauma (my best friend died in my arms at 18 and I didn’t really deal with it). 
  
 

  I guess my question - have you all experienced symptoms like constant twitching (mine is calves, like snakes are under my skin) and neck /joint stiffness and buzzing /electricity in your body? Have you had sudden onset panic attacks and insomnia seemingly out of nowhere (doesn’t seem like out of nowhere now that I type it). I have no appetite. I can’t exercise without a major crash. It’s brutal. My central nervous system feels like I’m on constant fight flight. 
  
 

  I’m struggling. Scared to lose what I have built. Scared to die and leave my kids and wife. Scared to disappoint people and walk from my job. I’m seeing very catastrophically right now. Very black and white."

"Does anyone else have issues with being dizzy and light headed, even feeling weak constantly? I've been this way for about 2 weeks now and it just makes my anxiety even worse. Its like a never ending death cycle."

That way you learn how brutal a piece of shit job can be and you'll get your act together real quick. I wish I had done things that way but I graduated with a joke GPA and am now a groundskeeper at an apartment complex.
"Does anyone else have such extreme anxiety that they feel like they're not even in their body anymore? Like I could be dead watching my body. It's terrifying, I've heard it happens to people but idk, I have really bad anxiety to the point where I'm having to quit my job etc. I used to be healthy guy, I'm 35 now and every day I feel like I'm dying and there's another medical issue. Just started zoloft a week ago."
"Hello all,
  
 

  I am looking for a bit of advice in hopefully rewiring my thought process. I am fully aware that we are all aging, we are all going to die sooner or later, most of us will lose our parents during our lifetimes, some of us will lose their husbands and wives... This happens to every single one of us, yet I find it very difficult to deal with this reality of life.
  
 

  Not all the time, but sometimes I get into a circle of thoughts that only imagines the worst outcome. I can't even think of an option to replace them with their positive versions. Things that go through my head are:
  
 

  * I am likely to lose my partner before I die (we have a 20+ years age difference). I love my partner so very much and been together for the past 15 years.
  * Repeat: I am likely to lose my partner before I die. How will I cope with being alone? We only have each other and we know a very few people one can call a ""friend."" We have been completing each other in many aspects of life. How will I cope without my partner being around?
  * I am likely to lose my mother and father before I die. Moreover, what will happen when one of them dies and the other one stays on his/her own? I live in another country. My sister lives in another city. How are they going to cope being alone?
  * Repeat: I am likely to lose my mother and father before I die. I visit them at least twice a year. Most years, three times. How will I feel when they die? How will I cope with being in the same house they used to live?
  * How will I cope when I am on my own, get old, get sick? How will I survive?
  
 

  You see, the above list happens to most of us. Maybe not so if there is no such a big age gap between you and your partner, but still, one of you is likely to pass earlier than the other.
  
 

  I am 38 years old. Some would say 'you are in the prime of your life, go and enjoy the life' but over the past 6 months or so, these thoughts are all over my mind and impact the quality of my life.
  
 

  **TL;DR: How do you cope with worries about life events such as loss of a parent, loss of a loved one, or you aging, getting old, needing to be looked after.**
  
 

  Thank you very much for your help in advance."
"Hey guys
  So my anxiety journey has been wild. 
  I have been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks since I was 7. I was on meds in my early twenties..and after that I just kinda did therapy and got into CrossFit. 
  So I've had panic attacks on and off for years. I've been pretty good about controlling them as they haven't been super overwhelming in years.
  Well. I've been to the ER twice because of them just in May.
  My doctor put me on Zoloft. That was a disaster.
  Every side effect you can get. I got. I was only three days in and I stopped as it was unbearable.
  I have Valium for when it gets really bad. But I'm trying very hard to not rely on it as Ive been going for years without anything and I understand meds can be very helpful and I'm not knocking them. I just feel like it isn't my path
  
  So folks out there who have had success on a different non medicated path, what did you do? 
  Thoughts?"
"I just called home and cried to my mom.
  I'm 39. 
  I finally admitted out loud that I'm having a rough go. 
  I asked them to fly down.
  It feels good to say it out loud. 
  It felt good to cry. 
  On top of my anxiety my stomach has been hurting and I haven't been able to eat alot. So that isn't helping my anxiety.
  Hopefully I'll be able to sleep tonight since I was able to unload my emotions. 
  I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow so hopefully that will help as well and I have a therapy appointment next Tuesday. 
  Anyone out there?"
"I have made a lot of progress with my social and generalized anxiety in adulthood but I keep coming back to upsetting things that happened to me as a child. I am 39 and I have been anxious for as long as I can remember. Things that have happened in my childhood have definitely had an impact on worsening my anxiety. I was never abused or traumatized; it was more about how I was ignored or belittled as a child and also the bad experiences in school and by so called friends.
  
 

  For some reason, yesterday afternoon I began thinking about some of those experiences and became very sad and depressed for a couple of hours. I was able to work through my feelings pretty quickly. I wish I could fully move past these memories and not let them drag me down any more. Does any one have any tips or tools they have learned?"

"I'm battling with anxiety for years now and recently it has become worse again. I'm literally battling, because I'm actively doing things that I know that will make me anxious. This has helped me in the past, greatly. Also, I have to do at least one very stresful event every week (it's my work) so I can not not do anything.
  
 

  My last panic attack was in a theater, while watching a show. So today I'm going to the theater again, by myself. Just to prove my anxiety that I'm not running away and that I'm able to endure it. If I get a panic attack, I will go to another show this week again. I really believe this is the way forward. But, from the other hand, because I endure so many stressful moments now, my body and mind are on edge and even more anxious than normal. Now even the smallest stuff makes me anxious.
  
 

  Maybe a week of doing absolutely nothing would calm my overworked nervous. But from the other hand, it also means I will have to cancel stuff and say 'no' a lot of times which might strengthen my anxiety in the future. It means my anxiety is 'right' and I should afraid of leaving the house, and better let me be alone.
  
 

  I really don't know what's the best approach for the long term. Rest until the body has 'calmed' and then start pushing myself again? Or just keep going and try to do something anxiety-inducing everyday?"
"You know what is crazy.
  I'm happy. Like legitimately happy. 
  BUT my anxiety shows up and makes every day things hard.
  Like bro. I'm literally chilling. Having a good day. Having a pretty good life going. But you come in and make it hard.
  Why?!!! 
  There is no reason for you to be here. 
  Boyfriend.. awesome. Great relationship. Happy.
  Job. Good. Can be stressful but not bad. Love it.
  House..I tried to buy a house didn't work..but I still have a home..maybe a stressor
  Health since you drove me to go to the ER...tests all look good. Including heart and chest x-rays and head scan..blood work nominal 
  But here you are. Just sitting on my chest for no reason. 
  Just reminding me that you exist. 
  Cool. Thanks. You've been manageable for years and now is the time? At my peak happiness?
  You need to scratch. You need to leave. I want to enjoy my life. I want to enjoy the moments I have with family and friends. 
  I'm sick of people judging me. Saying well if you have thoughts of harming yourself or others or if you go into a psychosis...um excuse the hell out of me. I have NEVER wanted to hurt myself or others and a psychosis? I've literally never been depressed. Ever. Just anxious. 
  Cool. Just make my anxiety worse. 
  Anxiety you lie. 
  Anxiety is NOT real it is a lie
  You need to screw off and find another place to rest your big fat heavy wings 
  I'm done"
"I don't meant that as a personal insult or attack, I mean as society as a whole. And I'm particulary aiming at the Western world.
  
 

  At first glance it seems like we live in paradise. Many people in less developed countries would literally risk their lives to set one foot in our lands. Our supermarkets and frigdes are full of food, we have high speed internet, entertainment, a lot of free time, cheap products, healthcare, etc. And best of all, we don't need to 'survive' anymore. We face few actual threats in our day-to-day life. It seems like a world where our ancestors could only dream of. We are safe, well nourished and protected from the elements.
  
 

  Yet, I know so many people that suffer from depression and anxiety. Mental illness is at an all time high. I know some of us have experienced real trauma or disease that could have caused their anxiety but I'm guessing that for most of us that isn't the case. Most of the people I know with this are doing well in life and have no clear cause that they could point at.
  
 

  I have been thinking about this a lot and I think that the problem lies within our modern lifestyle. It is simply way too different than how we as a species have lived for over 100.000's of years.
  
 

  \- We sit too much and move too few  
  \- We watch screens too often and are exposed to 'unnatural' light at a daily basis  
  \- We are bombarded with news, threats (war, covid, global warming, etc) on a daily basis  
  \- We have constant 'mini' stressors (traffic, being late, e-mails or phone calls, appointments, etc)  
  \- We have no 'real' threats such as dangerous animals or enemy tribes  
  \- We spend too few time outside (in sunlight)  
  \- We constantly scroll trough new content. I think most of us suffer from some form of ADD by now. It's hard to be 'bored' when there is always something new and exciting around the corner. We buy a lot of shit, we watch new TV shows and films / video's and everything is instant or at least very quickly at your doorstep. Constant instant gratification is messing with our brains.  
  \- We have no fights or anything else that physically cools us off afterwards  
  \- We have too much time to think. And we constantly munch on information (such as reddit) that makes us think about more stuff even more.  
  \- We have all seen extreme stuff in our lifes. Hardcore porn, people dying on camera, the misery of poor African children, etc. 
  \- We simply know too much  
  \- We eat processed food and probably too much of it  
  \- We are exposed to a lot of chemicals through food, cosmetic products, our tapwater, medications, etc
  
 

  Some of the above, or all of them, could be causing our mental health problems. One thing is for sure, we live radically different than our ancestors and our brain's haven't caught up yet. Maybe that won't even be possible. We are animals but we live nothing like it anymore. I would call this an 'unnatural lifestyle'. 
  
 

  I often fantasize about leaving this all behind. Throwing away my phone and computer would probably be a very good first step. Spend more time outside. Go into nature. Fishing. Hunting. Gathering with like minded folks. Gardening. Or just simply chilling in nature with friends and family, eating freshly cooked foods and sing together around the campfire. 
  
 

  I think deep inside we all long for connection. Connection to other people, but also to nature and the elements. And we are so extremely far away from that. I know I am.
  
 

  And physically, we cannot 'expell' the stress hormones like this. We are made to 'fight or flee' from a threat. And doing so burns up the energy and adrenaline. Like a deer that has been chased by a lion and survives. The deer is not anxious for 2 weeks after suffering from panic attacks. No, it shakes their body for 10 minutes and gets back to eating grass.
  
 

  In stead of numbing ourselves with tricks, medication, distractions, etc, maybe it is time for a new revolution. One in which we stop becoming more 'modern', but actually go back a few steps to where we came from. Our bodies are meant to move. Our eyes are made for natural light. Our brains are made for problem solving and survival, and for connecting to other people. It's not meant to sit all day, to read about catastrophic events, watch porn, play video games or watch useless video's, Google about physical symptoms, while munching on unnatural food with 20 ingredients in our rooms with the curtains closed.
  
 

  I think we need to change drastically.
  
 

  Would love to hear your opinions on this."
"My husband (38m) has always joked that he’s not a “well” man. Since I met him he’s always suffered from anxiety (but been medicated consistently) and digestive issues such as IBS and sensitivity to dairy and other foods. 
  
 

  But over the past year or two it seems like something new is always wrong:
  
 

  - **Nausea:** He is throwing up and having diarrhea more than I think is normal, and it feel like he usually has an upset stomach. He’s started taking probiotics that have helped a little.
  
 

  - **Acid Reflux:** His acid reflux has gotten worse. Though he does take a daily pill for it.
  
 

  - **Stomach Pains:** Twice in the past year he’s has bad stomach pains and been to a specialist about it. They say it’s not an ulcer but sort of pre-ulcer-y and have put him on bland diets and given him pills.
  
 

  - **Urination:** He’s been having problems peeing, like frequent urination and low flow. He’s started taking something for that though it doesn’t seem to have helped a ton.
  
 

  - **Prostate Infection:** He recently started having pain during sex and went to get that checked out, and it turns out he has a prostate infection so he’s currently taking meds for that. 
  
 

  - **Shoulder Pain:** He’s had a lot of pain in his shoulders, helped a bit by a new mattress, but it’s mostly made him quit the gym for the past 6 months. It was so bad the other night that he went to the ER, but they just gave him a shot and some pain meds. 
  
 

  - **Always Tired:** He has been constantly tired the past year or so. We have young children that don’t give us the best sleep, but it seems like he could nap all day if we’d let him. He snores badly so he recently did a sleep apnea test and has moderate sleep apnea so they have referred him to a specialist to hopefully get better sleep.
  
 

  But on top of all these things, he has been a bit depressed and his anxiety has gotten bad again. He jokes that he’s going though a mid life crisis, which I think he is, getting sick of working but realizing there’s still a long way to go till retirement. He is also really down because he feels his body is “falling apart.” It seems he’s always feeling too sick or sore or anxious to enjoy life much lately, and it’s really been worrying me that’s he’s unhappy in our life. He recently saw a therapist for a few months and felt that helped a little but then stopped. I finally convinced him that he does need to ask his doctor to try switching his anxiety meds because they don’t seem to be working well anymore. He’s agreed to do that but needs to set up the appointment.
  
 

  I have a suspicion that all or at least a lot of his current issues are related to his anxiety no longer being treated well. Does that seem likely? Have any of you with anxiety experience these other issues? I think I’m just hoping there’s some light at the end of the tunnel for both of us if he can get on a better anxiety med."
"I'm 35 and I just got my L. I always relied on transit and my anxiety issues didn't make it easier. Today I feel like a reached a goal most immigrants and teenagers reach in such a short time. It almost doesn't make it feel like anything special happened today. It should have happened when I was 16. I actually did get it when I was 18 and later 23 and they expired after a year because I never did the road test. 
  Today was a big deal for me. I've been meaning to get it for a while now and I finally did it. Now I got to do the harder step and get lessons and then pass the N test"
"So I'm 35. When I went to give this lady at the counter my documents to take the computer driving test, she was a bit shocked about how I get around the last few years. Where I live everything is within 10 mins walking distance..what is so shocking about it? She made me feel like I've been hiding under a rock for a few years. I wish I spoke up and explained why I didn't drive all these years.so today instead of feeling like I finally achieved something, I feel like it should have been done long ago. I had no car though back then though."
So I have anxiety since 2005. I was on SSRI'S and benzos for a few years without major success okay benzos did the job but you can't use them long term. I don't have daily panic attacks just a few per year but I have anxiety daily. One day is good another day is bad. Most annoying thing is PVC palpilations after one or two I have anxiety attack and can't relax half of the day. I am afraid that my heart will stop. I can't relax. I check my BP few times per day and even worse I check my pulse 24/7. So basically one my hand is always checking pulse. I am so done with my life I feel I am loser. Other people exercise and I am afraid to jog because then my heart rate is high. I have hypochondria. I was in therapy for a few years. It helped but still anxiety is here. One day I have few symptoms and normal day and another day can be bad. I am so tired. I have girlfriend but I don't have single friend. We just meet my gf friend. I can talk about my anxiety only with my girlfriend or my mother. I want to be normal person without anxiety or at least accept my condition but I can't. I feel bad.
"The ACE score is 10 question, yes/no, quiz about things that may or may not have happened in childhood. 
  
 

  Are there people with low ACE scores that have social anxiety? And if that's the case, was there an event that's not touched upon in these questions that may be relevant or did you have a carefree life until you got anxious? 
  
 

  I also read that emotional abuse predicts mental health problems stronger than other forms of abuse. I read this in Johann Hari's book about depression and anxiety called 'Lost Connections'. ""Cruel parents"" are mentioned, which is interesting. My parents weren't particularly cruel, but in their desperation they could do cruel things sometimes. Their parents, by the stories I heard, were pretty cruel. So sad that things like that happen. 
  
 

  My own score is 4 and I have (had) problems with anxiety and depression, and also physical health problems. I just wondered if people with social anxiety have high ACE scores and couldn't find anything, so decided to ask the community.
  
 

  Edit: forgot the link to the test [ACE test](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/03/02/387007941/take-the-ace-quiz-and-learn-what-it-does-and-doesnt-mean)"
"Does L-Theanine increase GABA and serotonin in the long run when taken daily for an extended period, not unlike SSRI’s, albeit probably much less potent?
  
 

  And if so, how long did it take before it started having a positive impact on your anxiety?
  
 

  Thanks!"

"Hi, 37M here. Have had red blood in stools for about 3 days every 2 weeks for the last 8 months. Went to a doctor first up who did a digital rectal exam and anoscopy and diagnosed hemorrhoids. I got prescribed some cream. Used it often. However, the bleeding continued and the anxiety got the better of me. So, went to another doctor who suggested a colonoscopy. Had that a couple of weeks ago and all was clear, except Grade 1 hemorrhoids and mild diverticulosis, which the doctor said is common. No polyps, no inflammation. No biopsies taken. The doctor said my next colonoscopy is due only when am 50. This week, again, have been having bleeding for the last 5 days. It is bright red on the toilet paper and a few drops on the stools. Am fairly regular with bowel movements (once a day) and stools are soft. I also have no major pain, except maybe just a little bit when I go.
  
 

  How can Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids cause bleeding so regularly? For 8 months, and 3-4 days every 2 weeks. Can it be something else, even with a clean colonoscopy?? Could cancer have been missed? Continues to worry me."
"Hey y'all I started taking CBD gummies and I definitely feel way calmer. 
  I have Valium for immediate relief if needed.
  I looked it up. And it states there is no interaction between the two.
  I know your not pharmacists.
  But anyone ever go thru this?
  
 

  I can't take SSRIs so I'm trying to find out a different path.  
  
 

  My question is the gummies seem to be working. But if a really bad flair up occurs is taking my Valium ok? 
  
 

  I start therapy on Tuesday.

"I recently herniated a disk in my back for the second time in two years. In addition to the pain in the back, now I'm feeling pains all over. I've become convinced that I have undiagnosed cancer that will be found a week before I pass away... 
  
 

  
 

  DAE get these feelings? I'm 36 and about 40 lbs more than I should be... but my most recent physical/blood test in Dec. came back good. Any good tips on not stressing about ""dying"" every time something hurts/aches?"

"I’m a [36M].
  
 

  I experienced my first real panic attack 7 years ago, in class one day, during my second year of college.
  
 

  Since then, I’ve had a fog and a heaviness type feeling in my head and have not felt like my original self for the past 7 years now. 
  
 

  I am prescribed sertraline for 6 years now, which helps limit anxiety and panic attacks, but sometimes when the panic attacks still come, I faint.
  
 

  Does anyone else suffer from panic attacks where they actually faint and pass out?"
"[Link to the podcast](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/podcast/how-to-be-yourself-with-ellen-hendriksen/) (35 minutes long)
  
 

  A couple of people in this community have mentioned the book ""How to Be Yourself - Quiet Your Inner Critic and Rise Above Social Anxiety"" by Ellen Hendriksen. Before I read anything I always try to find a podcast or an interview with the writer to see if what they say resonates, this way I don't buy books I don't finish reading :p I found this podcast called 'The Psychology Podcast"" and it's a pretty interesting conversation in my opinion. So I ordered the book and I thought I'd share it with you guys.
  
 

  One of the interesting things they talked about is that in structured interactions the difference between confident and anxious people isn't as big as in unstructured conversations. I guess it's kind of obvious that when there's less uncertainty you feel less anxious, but it's interesting to think about anyway. I was doing training to become a coach and I felt much more comfortable in the coaching role than in being coached. I somehow got to the conclusion that the coaching role inflated my ego because I was helping someone and that has made me hesitant to do this professionally. I thought that it wasn't a good idea to build my ego around helping people and that I should do my own work first and then get back to coaching people. Maybe it was actually the sense of control that made me feel more comfortable and I should explore it again. 
  
 

  Do you guys notice a difference between structured interaction and unstructured interaction? Or a difference between specific situations that stands out to you?
  
 

  They also talked about high sensitivity, the propensity to feel deeply, and how many people with these traits are creatives. Creating is also something that I'm drawn to and it makes me happy, so I started doing more of it lately and it has been so amazing. 
  
 

  They talked about other interesting things too. Curious what you think!"
"They used to come on gradually, symptoms building up in severity slowly over time.
  
 

  But now, I can just be talking to someone and think 'fek I'm hungry and I can't leave yet' (or something stupid like this) and BOOM. Headrush. Dizzy. Sweating. Slow vision (feels like by brain is behind the visual input). And of course, a sense of doom and wanting to leave ASAP.
  
 

  When I leave the situation it quickly subsides. Very weird.
  
 

  What could be the reason for the fact that this has changed? I did have more panic attacks like this one over the last 3-4 weeks. Could it be that my nerves are just 'on edge' and kind of 'anticipating' the next adrenaline rush?
  
 

  I also have tired eyes during they day, constantly since a while. Almost dizzy-like, but without the spinning sensation. Seems to me that my brain is just overtired from all this shit.
  
 

  Has anyone else see their anxiety (and physical symptoms) change over time?"
"I think this is common for many us anxiety sufferers, but I will try to explain briefly how it works for me.
  
 

  I've realised that most of my physical stress and panic sympoms arise in situations where I cannot easily leave. I mean this both physically (airplane, elevator) or 'socially' (theater, being out with friends, etc).
  
 

  Now especially the latter one is interesting. Of course one can just leave the theater, the doors aren't locked. It's just that you will look stupid to people you don't know. And maybe your friends / family that are there with you might think it's a weird move of you to leave.
  
 

  That's it. I know this. But my subconscious mind, apparently, thinks otherwise. It throws symptoms at me like I'm in a terrible, dangerous situation. And leaving is no option, or either will cause terrible consequenses. That's how it feels.
  
 

  But I know it's not true. And I genuinly (at least consciously) don't care what strangers might think! And my friends will probably understand. And if not, then fuck them. Really, I don't care. But I cannot convince my body that nothing is wrong.
  
 

  What is going on here? Who of the two is 'right'? And how can I align with my subconsiousness?
  
 

  Today I went to my parent's house (my parental home even) and I am fucking nervous. The whole time. For what?? They are my parents. It's my home. They love me nomatter what. I can leave at any time. Why I am anxious and nervous? And whatever I think or come up with, it doesn't work. I tell myself these very things and yet my body is anxious.

"Hi there , 40M , was diagnosed with GAD about 7 mth ago.( sametime i stopped smoking cold turkey after 12 years). 
  
 

  I’ve recently began workout at a gym . Mid way through the routine sets , ill experience some high heart beat and short breath ( usual feel during a workout) and sametime i would also feel some mild anxiety kicking in. 
  
 

  It triggers a scared and worried thoughts. Like i could faint , get a heart attack etc. 
  
 

  Has anyone felt this before and how do you go about this?
  
 

  After I’m done with my workout and back home. All is back to normal.
  
 

  Thanks for listening and hope to hear some good advice from anyone.
  
 

  Thanks"
"I really question this sometimes. I'm sure my lifestyle and (thinking) habits weren't the best. But still, my first panic attack came 'out of nowhere'. And since then I am battling this panic disorder with ups and downs.
  
 

  My mom also had it. Started around the same age too (30's). She took SSRI's for a while to 'increase the amount of serotonin in circulation' as her doctor told her (30 years ago) and after a couple of days she started feeling better. And she could finally sleep. She now, still, takes 3 half tablets per week as a maintenance dose. It works for her, for 30 years already.
  
 

  Anyway, I'm trying to talk myself into having something or anything, but I genuinly wonder if it's a genetic thing. And if it's genetic, it has a physical cause right? Or that indeed, my brain's receptors or neurotransmitter levels are off. Or that there is something wrong with my adrenal glands. 
  
 

  Nowadays I'm even getting physical symptoms at the silliest events or places. Like being at the playground with my kids. Or sitting in my parent's garden talking to them. There is nothing to worry about there. I can leave at any time. I'm not in danger. I know this. I tell myself this. And I believe it. Yet, my body / subconscious thinks otherwise and it throws heavy physical symptoms of stress on me.
  
 

  Sometimes it doesn't even start with a thought anymore I think. It's just the habit of my brain. Maybe the cause of my anxiety was 'mental' in the past, but became 'physical' over the years of stress and anxiety? I think it is very likely that anxiety can literally alter the brain, the receptors, the neurotransmitters, adrenal glands, etc.
  
 

  So, what do you think? Is anxiety a physical or mental disorder? And is it possible that, at one point, it morphs into a physical disorder?"
"So. My anxiety has been spiraling for about two weeks. Finally simmering down a bit.
  Hopefully.
  But it seems as though my anxiety kicked up because I'm happy. Isn't that some shit?
  I went through an abusive marriage and didn't once experience really bad anxiety attacks. Ive had anxiety for years. But it's been controllable. 
  Here I am in a job I love, I'm with a partner I love and I just bought a home.
  Now I'm constantly feeling like something is wrong with me. Heart attack..stroke..etc. you get it.
  Apparently I can't JUST be happy. Im so used to upheaval and drama ..that with everything going well...this is how my body reacts. Like WTF. 
  I mean granted buying the house has been a disaster but I close on Tuesday.
  Anyone else go through this? I'm in therapy and we're doing CBT. I'm also on CBD gummies. I have Valium for the bad moments. Thankfully only had to take that three times in a month...
  But any thoughts on this?"
[removed]
"Apologies if any of this is triggering for anyone--- So, I've had elevated anxiety for quite a long time. It's rarely been debilitating, exactly. It always feels mostly ""mental"" and I can deal with that okay. 
  
 

  But yesterday I had a panic attack that was quite different. I felt physically very weird. I tried to take a walk and it just seemed to stay the same or get worse. And then my extremities started tingling. Like... A TON. My face, even the roof of my mouth eventually started tingling all over. I had very short moments of... some kind of feeling in my chest. 
  
 

  So I ask my wife to take me to the hospital. I'm definitely getting more and more upset and doom-y as I'm there. They take an EKG they take my blood and nothing's the matter except for maybe slightly low potassium. They give me 1mg of Ativan and that first calms me down mentally- which itself was really weird because I was still tingling \*\*everywhere\*\*. But then that starts to pass too after 10 or 15 minutes. 
  
 

  They give me some hydroxyzine and tell me to follow up with my primary. Which I will. And I'm basically fine with all this. I knew I had anxiety, maybe I didn't realize it was quite so bad, but I'm ready to work on it. 
  
 

  But it still irks me and maybe even scares me a little that the symptoms can be so *physical*, and even their little pamphlet says that they can be similar or the same as heart attack or stroke symptoms. I'm 35 and quite overweight. I know that would be young, but not unheard of. I know there are more classic symptoms than what I had, but then you see these stupid stories everywhere that's like. ""Oh I got a tummy ache and I farted a little differently than normal, and, well, wouldn't you know it, heart attack!"". That's obviously exaggeration but a lot of the times these things \*aren't\* the classic symptoms. 
  
 

  So what do you do when you *know* you have this panic/anxiety thing, but it also feels physically like another serious ailment? Do you just treat the anxiety assuming it's that? Do you have to have like the bullseye of other symptoms before seek help for the other thing?"
"I'm 35 years old and have my license, but I've avoided driving for 5+ years. Even the thought of pulling out of the driveway scared me. It's something I've felt tremendously insecure about. 
  
 

  Well, for nearly a week, I've been driving almost every day. I started by driving to a pharmacy that was just less than 10 minutes away with someone in the car with me. I took only the back roads of my neighborhood. It was a little terrifying but I felt really good afterwards.
  
 

  After that, I increased my driving time to 15 - 20 minutes. I drove around my neighborhood, avoiding busier streets, just getting used to how the car felt, slowing down, speeding up, turning, etc. 
  
 

  Then I managed to drive to and from my therapy appointment, and picked up my nephew on the way home (about an hour of driving) with my brother-in-law in the car with me. It was also raining. I avoided the parkways, but managed to drive on busier roads to get there. 
  
 

  Today, I drove to and from the aforementioned pharmacy by myself. I was sweating bullets the whole time, but I made it back home safely.
  
 

  I wanted to share some of the things I've personally found helpful in getting started again. I'm sure a lot of you have heard of these, but this is what worked for me:
  
 

  1. Map your route. Have a clear objective in mind about where you're going. Google Maps lays out the trip in steps and also has photos of the streets/where to turn/etc. A lot of my fear came from not knowing exactly where to go/where to park, but Google Maps helped take a lot of guesswork out of the drives and helped me feel more at ease because I knew what to expect.
  
 

  2. Start small. That could be just sitting in the car with the engine turned on for five minutes, or just going in reverse in the driveway then driving forward again a few times. Don't feel pressured to take the next step until you feel comfortable. Setting small milestones helps you progress consistently. I started with 5-10 minute drives, then eventually worked my way up to 20-30 minutes, then to an hour. Pace yourself. Maybe one day your goal is to park between two cars in a parking lot, or to cross a busy intersection. Having small goals has helped me feel much less overwhelmed.
  
 

  3. Adjust your seat and mirrors so that you are comfortable. Make sure your mirrors are properly adjusted. I'm short, so raising my seat enough and being closer to the steering wheel was really important. You want to make sure you're positioned in a way that allows you to see around your vehicle. This will help you feel more in control.
  
 

  4. YouTube videos. I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos to refresh my memory on basic things -- pulling into a parking spot properly, making turns, controlling the throttle, changing lanes, etc. Of course, if you're trying to get your license, it's always good to make sure you study the specific rules in your state/country too.
  
 

  Anyway, I hope my experience gives someone out there some hope. I've been in that place too of feeling completely stuck on my fear and being overwhelmed at the mere thought of driving a car. But honestly, the hardest part was just taking that first step. Once you can manage to pass the hurdle of getting started, you're already making progress."
"I (38F) had my first mammogram today. I'd been dreading it for six weeks. All is well, had same say results! I read several posts on this sub that helped a little, so I want to give back to the community. 
  
 

  The biggest takeaway is that truly...it wasn't as bad as I'd built it up to be in my HA head. True story. I guess it depends on the person, but for me, minor discomfort. If this is what I have to do once a year as a preventative health strategy, I'm okay with that. 
  
 

  Here are my tips: 
  
 

  Your best friend is distraction. I did everything I could to distract myself the closer the day came. 
  
 

  But that didn't stop me from crying all morning. I couldnt fight all my nervousness. Have someone go with you. It's comforting. Try to bring someone who makes you laugh. 
  
 

  Take an ibuprofen before you leave for your appointment. I had minimal soreness later in the day and maybe that helped. Mentally for me, it felt like a proactive move.
  
 

  Find out if they look at your pics while you're there or after you leave. My mammogram was diagnostic rather than a screening, and I don't know if that makes a difference. But they usually have to re-do one of the angles, and it was nice because I did it right then instead of days later. The whole process wasn't prolonged.
  
 

  I also had an ultrasound done. If you need extra reassurance, an ultrasound can offer that. I left feeling like I'd been 100% examined. 
  
 

  And finally, let the technician know if you have a raised mole or spot on either breast. I have 2 on one breast and they showed up on the scan, which caused them to have to re-scan."
"My boyfriend (37M) is away in a diff country to see his family and then attend a friends wedding (3 hrs away). He is gone for two full weeks.I (35F) was okay in first week as he would text often and send a voice note when he went to bed. Since he has been at a friends wedding for last 3 days he still texts during the day but doesn’t send the voice note before bed. He is usually up early but since he has been at the wedding I can tell by his online status he has been waking up later.
  
 

  
 

  He was trying to hide in beginning that he’s gone for 4 days for his friends wedding. The wedding is a 2 day affair, he just wanted to make a solo trip out of it but was reluctant to tell me abt it .
  
 

  The fact that 1) he skipped details about length of his trip until I asked and 2)he is avoiding any interaction with me during his evening time and skipping the Gnite message makes me wonder if he’s bringing someone back to his hotel room. May be an old fling, a drunk bridesmaid or an escort. His default reaction when I express my emotional needs is feeling like he did something wrong - though he eventually comes around and shows his understanding and support so I pick and choose where I ask for his support. 
  
 

  Help , I am spiraling. I have been cheated on by all of my exes when in same scenario / when my intuitions couldn’t be silenced. I plan to marry this person and I wonder if I should not proceed until I work on my anxiety a bit more and also he works on understanding my needs and not reacting poorly when I ask for assurance. 
  
 

  My anxiety is trying to keep these extreme high stress scenarios away so the easiest exit is to find evidence of him cheating and break up. The stress is making my heartbeat shoot up occasionally and my stomach sick. 
  
 

  Should I talk to him about my doubts and anxious thoughts?
  
 

  Should i keep this to myself because he hasn’t otherwise given me a reason to doubt him ? And it’s me who has the anxiety issues."
"I have this friend who travels a lot for his job and is extremely successful in his career. I don't have anything against the guy and like him so it's not exactly jealousy that I feel towards him, but I feel bad that I'm only able to hold down a $12 an hour, 40 hour a week job. I always hear that comparing yourself to other is a bad idea, but I can't help it a lot of the time because I feel like a loser. I also don't know how to change my circumstances because anxiety etc holds me back really bad. How do I stop myself from feeling this way? How do I stop myself from comparing myself to others like this?"
"Once in a while, when I'm being physically active, I get a bout of low blood sugar. I haven't actually measured the values of my blood, but I do feel the symptoms of it (which suck balls). And after eating something, 10-15 minutes later I feel better.
  
 

  Just 30-40 minutes of table tennis (on my VR headset) seems to do the trick. Not always, but also not once in a blue moon. 
  
 

  This happens more in or after stressful periods. I.e., my body is still in 'recovery' mode. There seems to be a pattern. I was more anxious lately, and this week I had 2 times low blood sugar.
  
 

  Once in a while I practice intermittent fasting and I have few problems with it. If I ate enough fat the evening before, I can easily go 14-16 hours without food, without getting low blood sugar. 
  
 

  But on other days (eating normally or not), if I play some table tennis 2-3 hours after eating, I can have a big crash later.
  
 

  So, I don't think I am diabetic since I can do the fasting but I am prone to episodes of low blood sugar if I don't eat well, or exercise. And periods of stress seem to make it worse.
  
 

  Relatable for anyone?"

"I'm (M38) on wellbutrin since april, it helped tremendously for my lifetime social anxiety, ocd (perfectionist type), but not so much for depression. In fact I've had few crying spells. I exclude manic reactions, because of no extra energy or strange activity, no grandiosity. I'm still in low grade but stable mood.
  
 

  Just a big improvement in social anxiety - more confidence, calmness in social situations, no more overwhelming cold feeling. Also my perfectionism seemed to lessen, I could more easily let go of constant correcting things.
  
 

  Very strange reaction - can someone could explain me why?
  
 

  Many thanks! Also excuse me my english - it's not my primary language"
"I have a low heart rate some times. Just when sitting on the couch in the evening, lying down (before sleeping) I can have a heartrate as low as 51. Mostly my resting heart rate is between 51 and 60.
  
 

  So I don't even know what it's like when I'm sleeping. I probably don't want to know.
  
 

  Anyway, I feel fine albeit a bit 'slow' and when I get up to walk or do something, my heartrate also immediately climbs up. So there is probably nothing 'wrong' per se.
  
 

  But since I'm not a sporter / athlete at all, I'm just wondering how this might work. Could my anxiety be the cause for a lower heartrate? And why would it do that?
  
 

  Anyone else has this?"
"Hi, i suffer from anxiety and depression almost my entire life. 
  Now I'm 37 and i feel like a noob, again from the bottom.
  
 

  The last year i can go to wirk, with friend, travel alone a lot of things..i was with ( Citalopram ""celexa"" 10mg and then 0,5mg ), then i move from Germany to Italy.
  
 

  Everything was ok, then i had a lot of problems, stress Everything but i manage very well...
  
 

  3 months ago i decided to just lower the dose till i don't take it anymore..so....surprise!!
  
 

  3 weeks ago i have the worse panic attack ever!! now i start with agoraphobia too yeeeeh!!
  
 

  I go to the doctor (psychiatry) and cry because i had a panic attack there, they give me again citalopram 20mg because 10mg makes me nothing and xanax if i had some panic attacks just in case...
  
 

  I wish i can go out with my pets, to the beach, to the grocery store, just normal thing's 😢 
  
 

  
 

  What can i do??
  
 

  Thanks in advance and sorry for my broken English."
"I'm thinking hard about my anxiety disorder. Recently I had a panic attack during a show in a theater. I didn't accept this, so I went to another (random) theater show 2 days later. Just to proof to myself that I can do it. Again, panic symptoms near the end of the show. Extremely strong.
  
 

  Now why do I have this? I am no longer thinking that my panic leads to an actual bad outcome. I no longer think that I might die. Have a heart attack. Lose control. Faint. Go crazy. Etc. I know panic attacks are temporary and that they will pass. Time has proven this.
  
 

  I just want to get rid of the physical symptoms. I did it before, with exposure. Just keep on living my life and eventually things got better. But now it's worse again and I don't know why. I want to go to the core / root cause of the problem.
  
 

  So when I imagine myself sitting in an empty theater, like nobody there, no artists and no audience, then I think there is absolutely no problem. I would be sitting there with no physical symptoms.
  
 

  But, add people to the mix and suddenly I would feel 'trapped'. But the doors aren't actually locked. I'm just socially trapped. So does this mean that I actually care about what other people think of me? And is that the root cause of my anxiety? I always thought I don't care, but my subconsciousness does. Apparently.
  
 

  It's the people variable that creates the anxiety. That is why driving alone is no problem. Sitting at home is no problem. Empty restaurants wouldn't be a problem. But, put me on a chair in a restaurant with other people on the table and 'hokus pokus', anxiety will arise. 
  
 

  How about to solve this one? How to stop giving a fuck. How to convince my body that it can chill the fuck out. How to tell my subconscious that I have self worth and don't need other people's approval?
  
 

  I never thought I cared much about other people's opinion. But I cannot draw any other conclusion from the above thought experiment.
  
 

  Does this makes sense to anyone else?"
"Do I have something like ADD or something?
  
 

  I notice that when I talk to people one on one, I do maybe 5% of the talking, while the other person does 95%. I just have a hard time following at times and or making it interesting.  
  
 

  Now, because of this, if I do a presentation or public speaking for a meeting example, I might do a quick 10-20 sec intro of who I am and I will quickly try to make someone else make conversation out the audience or my side speaker and if it gets silent because I can't think of anything I will turn red and say ""oh, really got me on the spot"" laugh it off and still can't think of nothing to say or be on topic (sound professional) and pass it to my side speaker... this is bad because of my job title which requires good communication skills. I'm 36 and this been with me forever. I'm just bad. I remember in college for public speaking, I had a choice to even talk about something I like (tuning a guitar) and I tend to be very quick to explain and not prolonging, but I tend to freeze a bit. I am just not that talkactive because it wears me out.  
  
 

  This also hurts me in dating... After 2 dates or so, the girl stops seeing me because I get bland."
"Hey guys, I'm 36M had anxiety for about 3 and half years now and I'm Lexapro 10mg since then. 
  I normally don't get panic attacks but I did get one out of the bloom last week. 
  I was just feeding my cats and out of no where I had a panic attack. I had to call 911 and by the time they got home I was doing ok. 
  When I checked my BP it was around 188/103. I've normally sern 160s before, but this time it was more. Do we know of the blood pressure can reach around 200 during anxiety/panic attacks? 
  And yes, I will be talking to my doctor and do some blood work as well. Haven't done that since pandemic started."
I’ve packed on 25 lbs. It started last year when I started an SSRI and now I’m on a lot of antihistamine (had a vaccine reaction and physician is trying to calm my system). Any tips on re-engaging my metabolism ? I’m never full. I eat all the damn time. I work out hard and still gain weight. It’s awful
"I'm 36. Have my permit but not my license. I've drove a few times and always do great, but I cannot bring myself to pass for my drivers license. I would have better opportunities for getting a job at the shift I want and such but I just cannot do it. I'd like to try some driving this weekend. I always want to but talk myself out of it. My kids would have more experiences and so would I if I just drove a stupid car."
"I’ve had a crackling/nervousness in my voice for 6 years now since I experienced my 1st panic attack my 2nd year of college when I was 30 years old.
  
 

  I’m scared to speak and find myself taking deep breaths before I do so. Especially before answering the phone or asking someone a question. It has become debilitating and I’m constantly thinking about it.
  
 

  I’ve been on serotonin for 5 years now which prevents my panic attacks from happening almost 95% of the time but this change in my voice will not go away.
  
 

  I don’t know where else to go for help. My doctor says it’s normal and he doesn’t see anything unusual about my voice but there is something."
"When I sleep, my body feels numb and I sometimes wake up catching my breath or panicking because my arms or legs feel dead. 
  
 

  I went to a cardiologist the other day and he said all is well. I went to the ER that night because I experienced the same thing and woke up sweating and catching my breath. When i was in the emergency room, i felt nothing (probably because I wasnt alseep). They tested my blood and said it seems all is ok. Sent me home to take sleep meds and vitamin B. 
  
 

  I still feel it now, 4th day. And I am so worried. I will do further tests- ekg, blood sugar, etc tomorrow.
  
 

  Any of you experienced this and its just anxiety?"
So long story short I had my first panic attack in 2005 and today I still have anxiety and few panic attacks per year. I can live normal life I mean I have job I go out and do things other people doing except exercise. I am afraid that my heart will stop and etc. But still I have anxiety symtoms like fast pulse or dizziness on and off. How to accept it and live with it? I mean maybe it's time for me to accept it and move on. I have tried SSRI benzos and therapy. I am not afraid of anxiety only those physical symtoms are annoying.
"I've always had anxiety since I was a young child, although probably not realised that's what it was until quite recently. I had hearing problems when I was little and was very shy (still am) so I hated school, as kids would make fun of me and teachers were unsupportive and sometimes unkind. I would get chronic tummy ache, and dread going to school. Sunday nights were always the worst and I've carried that fear of Sundays and that sense of dread into my adult life.
  
 

  I'm 37 now and I don't think I've ever had anxiety so bad in my life. I've always found certain things anxiety triggering, such as meeting new people, driving to places I don't know, starting new jobs, but I've found that in the last few months even more straightforward things are starting to trigger anxiety, like taking a phone call, going into a shop or even getting out of bed! It's like I have that constant feeling of butterflies in the tummy that just won't go away. The only thing that seems to ease this is alcohol, which I know is not the answer, but it the only thing that gives me that little boost, confidence to talk to people and also helps calm me down at the end of the day. 
  
 

  In the last week though, things have sort of come to a head. I loathe my job and am desperate to leave, my boyfriend split with me last week which I am absolutely devastated about, and to top it all off I have a kidney infection. I was prescribed Sertraline a few months ago, but I've always been too scared to take it, but as I feel at my wit's end, I feel like I have no other options. I'm actually frightened now and don't know where to turn.
  
 

  Has anyone got any words of wisdom for me? Experiences they wish to share that might be useful? I feel like I'm driving my friends and family a bit crazy with my woes, would love to hear from anyone who's been in a similar boat. It's all feeling a bit much, just trying to climb my way out of this hole I seem to be in."
"Interesting that this sub exists and yet I've never used or come across it before.
  
 

  35M here. In high school, I was relentlessly bullied for five years straight. I had zero friends. To this date, almost twenty years since I left, I still associate a lot of my issues - related to anxiety and self-image - to those high school days.
  
 

  Recently, I moved to an area that has a lot of teenagers who hang out in the local town centre. I live quite centrally, and to get to the supermarket nearby, I have to walk directly past a spot where many of them hang out when school has finished. None of them ever say anything to me. None of them ever *do* anything threatening toward me. It's not a bad area, and they aren't *those* kind of teenagers. What's more, I've grown into a 6-foot 5 man, and as I said, I'm in my mid-thirties. I also go to the gym and work out a lot to help my self-image.
  
 

  Still. Whenever I walk past these teenagers in school uniform, it's like something inside me triggers from the recognition. I'm straight back there. I feel like I'm walking funny. I'm inherently aware of my heartbeat, my breathing. I feel like I'm stumbling and about to fall off a bloody cliff.
  
 

  Is it just me? Have any of you managed to overcome old triggers like this and stop being such a wimp who is put on-edge by a bunch of kids in school uniform?"
"Hello,
  
 

  I got my learner's permit when I was 19 years old. However, due to time constraints and driving anxiety, I constantly renewed every two years. I'm 35 now and thanks to my mother-in-law (who I drove within the backwoods of Ohio), I feel more confident.  
  
 

  
 

  In my state, one of the requirements is 60 hours of behind-the-wheel training and holding your permit for nine months, before trying out for a driver's exam. However, if you're 25 or older, only 14 hours is mandatory and a 45-day holding period. I have enough money saved up for driving school, which provides six hours of behind-the-wheel training off the bat. I feel like I want to start over and have a fresh reboot. However, driving schools also offer learning hours straight up.  
  
 

  
 

  What do you suggest? Thank you for reading my post."
"Hello!
  
 

  I’m a M38 who is somewhat intorverted and socially awkward, but generally likeable, reasonably eloquent and mentally healthy. However, on top of this, I have a couple of weird social anxiety issues. I want to discuss one of them in this post: Sometimes when I talk, I feel like I am about to start crying.
  
 

  It started around four years ago. I was at university and was arguing about some stupid little issue with a person in my study group. We were doing a writing assignment and she was adamant that it’s correct to write ”with the purpose which of”, while I maintained that it’s written ”with the purpose of”. It got a little heated, and all of a sudden, I started to notice that it felt like a lump was starting to form in my throat, as if I was about to cry. At the same time, my voice started to tremble. Emotionally, I didn’t feel like crying at all, so this was a purely physical experience. I felt like if I kept talking, I would not be able to stop myself from bursting into tears. ”What the fuck is happening to me? This is weird as hell!”, I thought, and tried to will the sensations away. Failing this, I had to actually end the conversation. 
  
 

  Fast forward a few weeks, and I’m doing a talk in front of a few students, also at school. It’s smooth sailing at first, but after a few minutes, the aforementioned lump is starting to form. Again, I feel totally fine emotionally. I’m not scared, sad, angry or stressed. It’s purely a physical thing. By a combination of lowering my voice, talking slower, taking pauses, occasionally coughing and clearing my throat, and, most importantly, cutting my talk short, I manage to get through it without incident.
  
 

  After class that day, alone, I call my sister to talk about it. And as I do, the floodgates open. I start crying, and cry, and cry, tears streaming down my face, not stopping for several minutes. She says it sounds like anxiety. 
  
 

  The issue persists throughout the rest of the semester. I develop two further strategies that help with it: One is to make sure to learn each talk inside and out. I notice that that mitigates it. The second one is, curiously, to make myself appear physically smaller. If I crouch down, or sit, the problem gets lessened compared to when I stand straight.
  
 

  This problem hasn’t really gone away. It rears its ugly head in job interviews. On at least one occasion, it has shown up during a normal conversation with an aquaintance. 
  
 

  I’d be interested in your input regarding this weird phenomenon that decided to show up out of nowhere at age 34. Where does it come from? What can I do to stop it?
  
 

  I know one way to lessen anxiety is to ask yourself ”what’s the worst thing that can happen”... But since the worst thing that can happen here is the incredibly embarassing event that I start crying in front of strangers, that doesn’t really help in this case.
  
 

  As you can imagine, this is somewhat debilitating.
  
 

  Thank you."
"In his book 'Scattered Minds', Gabor Maté discusses attention deficit disorder. To me, it feels like a lot of it is about social anxiety. The book has been very insightful for me and the passage below especially resonated. What do you think of the idea that social anxiety originates in the relationship with the parents? 
  
 

  ""The fear of intimacy is also a fear of the loss of self. There is the well-known paradox that the person with ADD craves real human contact, feels like an outsider, and wishes to belong-but at the same is reclusive, often preferring his own company to that of others. The paradox is due to his oscillating back and forth between two fears: the anxiety of loneliness and abandonment, and, opposing that, a parallel sense of danger that if he commits to a relationship, he will be overwhelmed, swallowed up. 
  
 

  [...]
  
 

  Such a person is presented with a choice, neither of which is satisfactory: one either chooses the relationship and gives up the self, or retains the sense of self but gives up on the relationship - and, in some cases, on almost all social contact. The unsolved problem is how to be oneself in contact with other people.  
  
 

  [...]
  
 

  The ambivalence is an intrinsic memory of childhood emotions when a choice had to be made between staying oneself, with one's real feelings and thereby jeopardizing the relationship with one's parent, or going for the relationship, at the cost of suppressing parts of oneself."""
So I will start off with some info on me. I am 38 married and have a son who just turned 14 yesterday. So I use to have no depression or anxiety. Then I went through a rough patch at an old job with a co worker and during that 3 years I became increasingly depressed. Then one night it hit me I had a good life insurance policy through my work had been with them for 15 years my family would be taken care of. And so that night I swolled a handful of pills. I started freaking out and made my self hlget sick a few times. I stayed up all night to make sure I was gonna be okay. And I then talked to my Dr. I quit my job and started a better job and things have been well for a good 5 years then it started to creep back up how useless I am and how I am holding my family back and I started to self sabotage my last job I started missing work goofing around and then in September they let me go. I have worked at a few places since I was let go all of them I have self sabotaged my position. I now have a great job that is well paying and allowing me to work from home. And I can't get my life in order I am starting to self sabotage again and I had thoughts of suicide last month and called and talked with my works telehealth support. But last Tuesday I cut my self in an attempt to end it all but I could not force myself to cut deep enough and I went to my wife and asked for help. It's been almost a week and I am back at work but I don't know what to do. Any tips or advice on how to get my life back together and beat this?
"When I have an anxious period, like now, it feels like I have soo much adrenaline / cortisol running through my veins. And everytime I get a little nervous for something, it gets blown out of proportion by, what feels like, a massive injection of adrenaline causing all the physical symptoms that us anxiety sufferers dread. Palpitations, ectopics (for me unfortunately), sweating, a rushed feeling, nervous stomach, change in vision, etc.
  
 

  For me it's the physical symptoms that 'set' me off. It's also what I fear and dread. It could be a question about the chicken or the egg, but I start to wonder sometimes if there isn't something physically wrong with me.
  
 

  Why does my body over react with the stress hormones? Is it really only caused by my thinking patterns? I often feel stressed for something or some event that I'm 'consciously' not afraid of at all. Or I wasn't even worrying about it (yet) and still, my physical symptoms begin and spiral me into more anxiety.
  
 

  Could there be any physical reason, treatable or not, that actually causes the whole anxiety disorder? Or at the very least, keeps it alive?
  
 

  Anyone knows of anything like this? Did you have anything tested or got diagnosed?"
"\[Male, 36 years old.\]
  
 

  I had bouts of PAC's in the past (had them checked by a Holter Monitor and recorded) but they were not frequent and (at least it felt like) pretty much random. They occured at rest, most of the time. I accepted the situation, just felt bad whenever I had them.
  
 

  Now since a day or 9-10 I have much more of them and they seem to happen when the stress / nervousness is high. That's bad news for me, because I have an anxiety disorder and in stressful times (like this period), I am often nervous about many things. Meetings, doctor appointments, etc. This period I had them almost daily.
  
 

  I had to go to the doctor 3 times this week, and all 3 times I got 4-5 ectopics in a row the moment I sat down in his chair. Two days ago I was underway to a friend, I get out of the car and boom, there we go again.
  
 

  It seems to happen at the moment that the nervousness / physical stress has reached it's peak and is about to come down.
  
 

  Anyway, this is killing me mentally. Because it means that, everytime I will do something that will make me nervous (many things), I am pretty much guaranteed to also have to deal with ectopic heartbeats now.
  
 

  Damn, this is the perfect recipe to develop agora-phobia and never leave the house again. The stress and panic attacks were already bad enough, but I could deal with them. Kind of. I always tried to push through. But having your heat beat irregulary everytime you are nervous, makes me even more nervous of being nervous.
  
 

  Fuck me, this is really the last thing I needed on my way out of this. I had an ECG today by the way (no ectopics during recording) and will have a Echocardiogram somewhere in the upcoming weeks, to see if they have a 'serious' cause. Until then I'm kind of in the dark, although I'm pretty sure that the underlying reason is stress built up in the body.
  
 

  Just wanted to vent and share my desperation. Any help is appreciated."
Anyone have strange energy patterns? Often I feel tired even after good sleep I wake up and can have kind of pain in my calf's. Sometime days are good and then other day is bad. I have it for years. But when I was on 20mg Seroxat I felt much better. I know it's anxiety cause physical symptoms but still my mind can't calm now I think it's long covid after my infection in January. :(
"I need some. Are there folks here who had (extreme) GAD / panic attacks / physical lingering symptoms who (almost) fully recovered?
  
 

  It seems like many of us, including myself, are struggling for long periods of time. At least on and off or in more or less severity.
  
 

  Anyone who can say they got it beat or almost?"
I have anxiety right now. I have pressure in my chest I have palpitations and can't live with my anxiety. I am so done. I am afraid fall a sleep and just done with my life. Sorry guys just can't hold anymore.
[removed]
So I have blood pressure obsession. I am 37M with anxiety. My BP in the morning is normal 115/77 and sometimes in the evening after anxiety I have higher like today 135/90 - 128/88 And then if I see higher than 120/80 I can't stop checking. So today I have checked my BP 30 times and my record is 60 times per day! It's crazy I can't live without machine taking to my job and on my holidays I am now abroad and can't relax because just got reading 125/85. I am afraid to throw away my machine because I feel that then I can't control my BP. It's crazy and making my anxiety worse. How to stop it? It's like of OCD.
"It's almost like my body doesn't know the 'middle ground'. It stresses over little things way too much, causing me to walk arround with a high heartrate when I'm working for instance. (I have a fairly stressful job)
  
 

  But the next day(s), my heartrate at rest (just sitting at a chair) is somewhere between 54-60. I have even measured 51 once. And I feel kind of 'slow' as well.
  
 

  It's like my body's 'relax' systems kick in at maximum, to counter the effects of the adrenaline surges from before.
  
 

  Sounds familiar to anyone? And is this how it could work in our anxious bodies? Too much action of both the sympathetic nervous system and para sympathetic?"
"I think many of my problems can be attributed to my physical symptoms and the following hypochondria.
  
 

  \- Feel my heart beating fast or out of rhythm -&gt; Anxiety  
  \- DP/DR or weird vision? -&gt; Anxiety  
  \- Nervous stomach and sweaty palms? -&gt; Anxiety  
  \- Any weird new onset of pain / trembling / whatever -&gt; Anxiety
  
 

  And if I am in that circle for a while, my body becomes even more 'aware' of itself. I can feel my heart beating (normally) now in my chest. My eyes are letting in more light so I'm more sensitive to (changes in) light and thus DP/DR. My tinnitus has become louder. 
  
 

  Even though I'm not stressed right now, pretty relaxed actually, my body is still in 'vigilance' mode. I'm sure this sounds very familiar for a bunch of you. But the question is, how to get out of this and break the cycle?
  
 

  I'm pretty sure that the above is the root cause for my anxiety disorder and probably for most of us. If we wouldn't feel our bodily processes all the time, wouldn't fixate on HOW we see in stead of what we see, could just fully engage in life and social activities without being 'stuck' in our own body which we fear might be broken, then I think 90% of the problem would be solved. At least for me.
  
 

  Any tips or advice, share that here!"
"I have my driving test next week
  
 

  This will be my fourth attempt. I’m so embarrassed to say that 
  
 

  
 

  I am 38 and I have to learn to drive as we have kids and don’t live somewhere with good transport. 
  
 

  During my lessons I’m pretty good, I’m relaxed and my instructor was certain I’d pass. But I get so anxious during tests that I just can’t think. 
  
 

  My last tester was not very nice and I’m having such anxiety I’ll have him again. I’m scared of changing lanes and roundabouts. 
  
 

  I won’t be driving the kids until I have my full license and I’m more confident of course. 
  
 

  I’m just going to be embarrassed if I fail again."

  I've had lots of upper body tightness for a couple weeks now, and that breathing pattern where I can't get a deep breath and yawn frequently to try to get a full breath. I've been keeping up with my HIIT workouts 4 times a week and daily walks with my dog. 
  
 

  Today I wake up and I'm nauseous, my body is TIGHT, I can't focus on anything, and I'm so tired. I NEVER get nauseous. I can't eat anything. I'm getting out of breath so easily. My upper abdomen/lower ribs even hurt. 
  
 

  Is it finally happening? Is this actually a heart attack? I can't bring myself to go to the ER and get a huge bill just for anxiety. I'm scared to do anything other than just sit here and pay close attention to my body."
"I spent 9 hours in an understaffed ER yesterday. Went in for my usual tight chest/pounding heart, but I was also having intense waves of nausea with major cold sweats. They triaged me for the chest issues first (EKG, chest x-ray, troponin bloodwork) and found nothing wrong. Then I had a CT scan of my abdomen and pelvis, and nothing was wrong there either. My blood pressure was never elevated. I even tested negative for COVID, flu A, and flu B. My heart rate stayed elevated, anywhere from 100 to 130, the entire day. My resting heart rate is usually around 70-72.
  
 

  I see a cardiologist once a year and they have never found anything wrong with me.
  
 

  So far this year, I have had two EKGs, a chest x-ray, a CT scan of my abdomen and pelvis, a brain MRI, and at least two rounds of very thorough bloodwork. And yet, I still feel anxious and I'm still convinced something is wrong with me. I've been on Lexapro for years but it doesn't seem to be working well for me anymore. 
  
 

  I don't know how to trust the doctors and tests. I really don't. I've never tried therapy but maybe now's the time."
"My fourth attempt will be in a few hours. I’m anxious as hell
  
 

  I’m just worried I’ll get the rude tester like last time and fail. I’ll feel so embarrassed 
  
 

  I just want to get this over and done with and never have to do the test again.
  
 

  
 

  Edit: I passed!"
"I had my fourth test and passed! Minor mistakes but I passed.
  
 

  My tester was so nice and even told me when to go on the roundabout as I was waiting too long. Didn’t mark me down for it 
  
 

  I’m so happy!"

"Hi All. Probably this post have been debated many times but I need to ask... or just vent.
  I think I am having health anxiety, for the past 10 years had intermittent palpitations. Sometimes just a flutter...sometimes strong pounds that make you dizzy for a second. Had ekgs, blood tests, 72hrs taps and echos nothing was ever found. Latest ekg and bloods ware done in April this year and all normal.i am currently on 40mg of propranolol twice a day prescription given to help in case my palpitationsare triggeredby anxiety. Eventhough I am on this is still get some palpitations every day..(more so in the past 3 weeks)not as many that I use to get when I wasn't. I also have graves disease but it has been dormant for the past 2 years. I am afraid to exercise on a treadmill or do activities as I am concerned will trigger a bout of palpitations. It is becoming debilitating. My GP does not seem to be very concerned and my private insurance just rejected my claim for further tests as they consider it as preexisting condition. So my question might be where do I get from here... has anyone been in this situation. Should I just accept that it is what it is and just move on? Kinda hard to do it as when they happen is concerning. Just to mention I am 37 , normal BMI and apart from graves no preexisting conditions... is it just anxiety 😬"
"I need help.
  I was in Hurricane Ian. I was in a house that the roof got ripped off. We had to run to a garage mid hurricane. I than sat up on a bucket for ten hours. No sleep. That was last Wednesday. 
  I haven't been sleeping well since. Last night I got four hours even with taking an Advil pm. 
  Tonight I'm wide awake even after taking an Advil pm. It is 5 am and I can't sleep.
  I'm so worried that I'm thinking of going to the ER. 
  I don't know what to do .
  Any thoughts? Should I go to the ER? I normally don't sleep amazing. But I sleep. This is just really freaking me out."

"Hi everyone, i kinda need to vent this. I (F37) recently went NC with my youngest sister. She has a son that i adore (M11) and that i practically raised. I decided to go NC because of her constant dismissal of my boundaries and entitlement towards me. I honestly have nothing else to give to her and she doesn't give AF about me unless she needs something.
  
 

  The thing is, it's her bday tomorrow and she, dunno why, told my parents that i was invited to the bday party. I already told them i won't be going but it's making me really fucking anxious and i feel guilty and about to spiral. I've been really unproductive at work and last night i barely slept so i feel insomnia will be returning, i guess. 
  
 

  We're already on family therapy for this and it has taking a lot for my parents to understand that they can't force a relationship between the 2 of us just because we're blood related, but i still struggle so much. Also, i miss my dear nephew terribly. She's punishing me and won't let me see him, wich also worries me cause he's really attached to me (i cook him healthy fun meals, i help him study, we do fun stuff like art or watching anime or goind to the fair - all of it out of my own pocket anyway) and he's called me crying twice now. I knew she would do this and i thought i was ready to bear it, but i realize he's getting hurt over this and i just... fuck, i'm so worried.
  
 

  What can i do not to spiral/cave in because of my nephew? 
  
 

  Thank you in advance."
"Rant--  
  I was just recently diagnosed with Severe social anxiety that I've been dealing with all my life and never really knew it was a thing. I am a 38f and can't even tolerate making necessary phone calls to have issues taken care of with my home. I'm new to Reddit and frankly I'm glad I came. As I read the posts on here I see that I'm not alone when it comes to how much anxiety impacts my day to day. I have no idea why I cannot simply just get past the dread and anxiety that comes with doing things that others can do without a second thought and it brings me down every day. I absolutely hate it and how much it impacts my life. I've missed some of my children's school events, Dr appointments and the list just goes on. I'm so depressed that I can't handle any of these normal types of things, upset that no one ever noticed when I was younger so I could get the help then. I've just started therapy but even that is a challenge as I get too anxious to even start trying to open up. So as my title shows anxiety blows and I wish I could just poof it away. I just want to be normal."
"I passed my test last week, and I’m going to go for my first drive alone next week. It will just be up to the shops which is just a minute drive but I’m nervous!

"Hi, I’m new to this subreddit but thought I could reach out to how I’m currently feeling. Little context, my kids (who are 10,8 and 4) are involved in sports. There activities are all on an app and for each team they have group chats and often send messages that require a response. Normally this doesn’t bother me but lately I’ve had to respond and I made few mistake grammatically and I even posted something publicly when I was supposed to message the person privately. It has made me so anxious and like I want to cry and have a panic attack. The thing is if someone else told me this I would be like, who cares. It’s not a big deal. Is this an indication of more relating to anxiety? I am not medicated but have been prescribed sertraline in the past that I didn’t take because my situation changed and I started feeling better without it. Any strategies you can help me with to get through this kind of stuff? I’m 40f and work from home with a supportive husband and 3 daughters. Thank you."

  But then it actually felt fun. (Still scary though ) and I played loud music and sang along to it.
  
 

  I’m going to do it a few more times and then do a few more different routes
  
 

  It actually felt like freedom :)"
"Hi all!
  
 

  40F here. I've always considered myself to have anxious tendencies, though it's been largely due to environmental stresses (work etc) and unhealthy relationship issues. I experienced severe social anxiety as a teenager but as I've grown I've managed to resolve that and now have healthy coping mechanisms.
  
 

  I've been seeing a guy 45M for just over a year and it's been pretty amazing. We have great chemistry, make each other laugh, he is sweet and loving, but very practical. He is an empath but has secure attachment. 
  
 

  Due to his living situation, he ended up moving in with me earlier this year with the intent he would save up and find his own place. It took a long time due to the rental market, but finally and with really short notice he found something a few weeks ago, for him, his son, granddaughter, his teen daughter (a weekend every few weeks)
  
 

  After seeing him every day for many months and it being such a healthy loving balanced relationship, I took him moving out really hard, and it triggered a level of anxiety in me I have never felt before. He didn't really want to leave much behind so it felt like I was losing him. I did try to communicate that I was finding it hard and was anxious that he would no longer have room for me in his life, but the reassurance he gave me wasn't enough to stop a spiral of anxiety. My reaction was to pack up the few remaining things he left (literally shampoo, a toothbrush, teabags) and try to convince myself that I'd not see him again, I guess in a way to prepare for the worst.
  
 

  I was really waiting for him to make the first move around seeing me again - I have 2 kids at home, 1 16yo full time and 1 10yo part time, he has an adult son and teenage daughter and it wasn't practical for me to leave my kids alone to stay at his house. Eventually he said he'd see me on Saturday, almost a full week after he left. Saturday rolled around and he called me to say he was going thrifting with his daughter (I have only met a handful of times) and would I like to come. I declined as I felt so crushed that it wouldn't be one on one and like I was an afterthought, also with feeling so anxious i didnt want to project that on his daughter who I have struggled to find a bond with. My anxiety peaked and I decided to openly communicate what I was feeling and my worries and what I needed from him to feel more secure. We talked it through and he understands and has given me what I needed which is a more solid view on what our relationship will look like now we have our own places. I have to make it clear I don't mind being alone and enjoy it, I just needed to know what our new relationship will look like so I can process and prepare for it.
  
 

  My father left when I was young (4) and i grew up with a distant mother and emotionally abusive step dad and I know that this has a lot to do with it. I grew up feeling abandoned by my father and with low self esteem, I blamed myself for not being enough for him. 
  
 

  This whole thing triggered those feelings of abandonment so much it was scary. He came over last night to stay and I felt so anxious I had to take lorazepam to try to take the edge off the spiral. It felt awkward and uncomfortable. After being, erm, intimate, I felt more reconnected to him but not 100%.
  
 

  I know this isn't his problem and I am so lucky he has chosen to stay by me through this but I know I need to resolve these issues I have, I just have no idea where to start. I've been trying really hard to communicate how I feel rather than bottling things up (my go to defense mechanism) which I guess is the first step. I want to try to give him reassurance that I am focused on dealing with this but don't want to make it a big deal.
  
 

  Not sure if this is a vent or asking other peoples experiences or suggestions on how I get help for this but I'm open to any input at this point!"
"Hey! Can you guys please help me try to sort out my stomach issues.
  
  On weekdays when I work, I feel the need to go to the toilet much more and more often. I always have BM in the morning when I wake up but after a couple of hours I may need to go again. Could this be due to my anxiety and stress? I have serious health anxiety and because I have a home office I ""have time"" to think stupid thoughts and google my stomach problems. Could this set my stomach off so I need to poop again?
  
  On the weekends I have BM on the morning, as usual, but as we have two children aged 6 and 2.5, it's all-in all day and I kind of don't have time to think about anything else but the children and the family. On weekends it never happens that I have BM several times a day, but on the other hand, on weekdays when I sit and work it is almost always like that. I also get very cold when I sit still so much that it feels like a nervous state in my body. I think this has gotten worse since I changed jobs and am sitting at home working. 
  
 

  I can also add say that I suffer from hemorrhoids and fissures. 
  
  What do you think? Are my stomach problems related to my anxiety, stress and nervousness?

"I know this will be long, but please read, there's got to be someone that is, or was, feeling how I am and I'd like some ideas of how to fix it.
  
 

  So long story short....
  
 

  I am 37 years old. In August 2021 (a year from this past August) I suffered, completely out of no where, my first ever panic attack. I had no clue what it was at the time but I slowly went system by system in my body trying to figure out what had just occured (eye dr, ent, cardiologist, neurologist) until, through research I found what I believed to be a panic attack. Since that afternoon in Aug I have felt ""off"" constantly.
  
 

  Fast forward to January 2022 I suffered my 2nd panic attack, and little over a month later I suffered my 3rd.
  
 

  In April 2022 I finally went to see a psychiatrist where I went over all my events. He diagnosed me with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. We started on lexapro and my anxiety has been darn near gone, as well as nothing close to a panic attack, still though I have this feeling in my head of being ""off""
  
 

  I've spoke with psychiatrist and we are currently working to figure that out.
  
 

  My feeling is very tough to explain, but the way best I feel is like everything visually is somewhere delayed, or very vivid. My best description is I feel like you do after you have a beer or two. Clearly not drunk but you just feel ""different"" or ""off"". 
  
 

  This feeling I have is constant I haven't been able to find anything online so that's why I'm here. Hoping that out of half a million people in this reddit group someone was, or is experiencing what I'm going thru and can help me.
  
 

  Thank you all in advance."
"Hello guys. 👋 I am 40 years old and have been living with trauma based anxiety and depression since 11 or 12 years old. Just to go into a little detail about that . I was abused at a young age. I have some family traumas and Relationship trauma. I do attend therapy I am on meds.
  
 

  Therapy has helped me tremendously to understand my anxiety and depression. Before I started therapy I just felt like I was crazy. But with work I now understand why I have anxiety and depression. I now can have some grace and compassion for myself. Things definitely make more sense to me.  
  
 

  But even though I know the root cause of these issues it doesn't make it go away. My system gets over stimulated quickly. Intrusive thinking is just the way my brain functions. I constantly feel like I'm talking myself out of some deep dark thought . So my fellow anxiety ridden friends. ..... what are things you do to ground and switch over the more rational side of your brain?"
"-Sorry if I explain this awkwardly, but I'm so stressed right now-
  Hi, me and my boyfriend (6 years relationship) where planning on having a Puppy for like a year ago. Then we bring home a beagle puppy 2 weeks ago. (context, I never in my life had a dog or puppy before, I'm 35 rn) 
  She's been with us for 2 and a half weeks now. The first week was a nightmare, I had 2 panic attacks for the first 4 days, and the last one when we bring her to my mother-in-law home the 7th day of having her in our lives.
  My bf is the best listener and he really understands me, and we talked about my PAs and we calmly find out that even though I was begging for returning or relacate her, we made a life's desicion, a desicion planned for a year.
  I accept that maybe I was allowing my anxiety to lead me to don't wanting her, I even read about puppy blues, I thought it was gonna be away... 
  But now, I think I was blinded for all the edited videos, cute tik toks and instagrams of nice cute and not at all messy puppies. I was so wrong!!!
  I don't like to pick up poo, I don't like to carry her as a baby (I don't have neither want to have human babies), I don't like to her being clingy, I don't like her to bite me and my clothes (in fact that scares me a little), I don't like to groom her (I haven't done that yet), I don't like to have stressful thoughts about her health, don't like to mopping my floor bc she bring dirty every time she go to the backyard.
  And now for the cherry on the top, my bf is having a strong pain in the shoulder that I'm super concerned about, he's been trying to make me feel like it's nothing to worry about, but I'm not sure. I'm scared. Aso I have this right breast pain when I wake up in the mornings, and I feel like we my bf and I are going to die or be unable to have this happy life we had because a stupid 9 and a half weeks old puppy. 
  Please help me, I'm not sure what to do, I'm super scared of everything rn."
"Hello everyone,
  
 

  I am 37 years old. Up until a few years ago I didn't know much about anxiety. I figured it was just something that we all dealt with to some degree. Throughout most of my life I have struggled with thoughts that people are judging me. I worry a lot about how I look to other people physically, verbally, emotionally. I probably came across negative at times due to always thinking worst case scenarios. My relationships with women usually fizzle out pretty quickly which constantly made me feel like I was inadequate. I have a little bit of OCD which I also didn't know was linked to anxiety. Although I was undiagnosed I felt like something was not right.
  
 

  After another relationship ended I figured I had to seek some help. On Sunday, I finally gained the courage to schedule an appointment with a doctor. After our session I was diagnosed with GAD and slight depression. I was given a prescription of 10 MG twice per day of Buspirone. I'm on day 4 of that medicine now. I know that things aren't going to get better over night but I feel better just knowing that I took that first step. I am hoping the treatment helps uncover my best self. I'm going through a tough time now but I am hopeful. I'm also grateful that I can come here and share my story. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read.
  
 

  Have a great day!"
"I've had anxiety for about a decade but done lots of hard work over the last couple of years. I've been in therapy since 2019, started studying a degree last year and this year I set up my own business. I also have two kids (11 and 9) and I do most of the child and home care stuff as my husband works long, unsociable hours. I was starting to feel more grounded, felt like I had purpose and meaning in my life and had found an ok balance between everything (although maintaining a social life usually slips between the cracks and I often can't find a lot of time for going out). 
  About a month ago I started experiencing intense back pain which turned out to be a trapped nerve and it completely floored me for a couple of weeks. I couldn't work, lost my appetite, couldn't sleep, take care of my kids or even move for days. I was on strong painkillers which left me feeling spaced out and caused heart palpitations but coming off them gave me severe headaches, nausea and sweats. After a few weeks I felt physically well enough to go back to work but my anxiety levels have been through the roof ever since. I've had three panic attacks this last week which I don't normally get, the pain has started creeping back and I know (in the adult, sensible part of my brain!) that I should have taken it all more slowly and did too much, too fast. But I get anxiety thinking about NOT doing; will I lose clients if I take anymore time off, can I even afford anymore time off, what if I get behind with my studies, I need to take care of my kids etc. I feel like there's no space for me to not be OK. 
  So then I get in my head worrying about the consequences of not being ok, which makes me feel very not ok, which makes me more anxious and so on it goes. 
  How do I break out of this cycle without losing either my mind or my business?"
"First session today, in about 30 years. Outside of message boards and friends. 
  
 

  Major depression with severe moments. 
  OCD on a few subjects. 
  Major panic/anxiety 
  PTSD
  
 

  And since I'm 40 now, blood work, and probably a colonoscopy soon. And with my BP going from low to prehypertension we're going to explore something to stabilize that. 
  
 

  And in a couple of weeks we try rapid eye therapy. 
  
 

  Then, if that takes, we're going to try to actually socialize me. 
  
 

  I no longer join the group, because the group has pushed me out. 
  
 

  I'm fucking terrified, thinking about trying to make new friends with people who don't give a damn that my hobby is growing flowers and listening to audiobooks. 
  
 

  But, I'm going to try. 
  
 

  New job starts on Monday, simple grunt work in a warehouse for 23/hr"
"I haven’t driven much yet since passing my test, but today I drove to the shops by myself. Parking is still a bit tricky for me especially when it’s a tight space. 
  
 

  But our shops have parking on the roof and it’s easy to get to and not many park there.
  
 

  I did forget to do the handbrake properly at first and messaged my husband (I pulled over) and asked him what that beeping was with the light 😂
  
 

  Oops."
"Happy Halloween! Today is my favorite holiday of the year. I'm 35F and have spent most years celebrating Halloween with alcohol. I've been sober for two months now. Today I'm really craving some wine, please help me get through this day alcohol free! Much love."
"I work from home and thus spend most of the days by myself, in my office. 
  
 

  I wonder if this is one of the reasons I suffer from anxiety. I do have a family, so in the evenings I am no longer alone, but just the long days doing everything by myself are kind of becoming a drag and I really think the lack of social interactions during the day result in becoming 'stuck' in your own head bascially. 
  
 

  Whenever I work with other people and outside of my home, I feel anxious at first (of course) but much better during and after the day. 
  
 

  So, how is your life? Do you spend most of your time alone? Is it a common trait of us anxiety sufferers?"
"Hi anxiety friends (sorry we have it but… here we are), 
  
 

  I just went down a bad Googling spiral of my symptoms (so dumb). I was doing well for me before this, I hadn’t Googled symptoms in a couple days which for me is huge (health anxiety is really high right now). I won’t say for what as I don’t want to trigger anyone — I was triggered from a Reddit post earlier before the spiral **facepalm**
  
 

  I know I should STOP doing this, but damn anxiety made me do it. 
  
 

  I feel awful about taking a step backwards as I know Googling is a big big no-no. I feel yucky and stupid. 
  
 

  Anyone else get trapped by Googling what they shouldn’t?"
"I (36F) have GAD and currently it's quite well under control thanks to therapy and a couple of lifestyle changes to limit negative stressors to a manageable level. Every now and then my anxiety is provoked to a point where I actively suffer from it and usually it's negative stress or worry, but in the past months I've had medium severe anxiety following a couple of intensely positive events. Very good things happen, I'm over the moon happy and content and living my best life... but the next night is very restless and almost nightmarish followed by a day of more or less agonizing and disturbing anxiety without me actually worrying about anything. Yesterday I found out that the person I adore has feelings for me and although this is a dream come true, I've really been suffering today.
  
 

  Do any of you have similar experiences? How do you deal with your happiness anxiety?"

Does anxiety trigger issues with memory? Like it is easy to forget names and things like that. Names are not as sticky as they used to be before this. I am 35 male and going on a year of the worst memory ever.
"I (37f) have suffered from anxiety and depression since grade school. It wasn’t treated then because my religious family thought it was the devil messing with me. I spoke with people associated with the church about my issues and I was told to pray more. As a result of my anxiety and depression, I was passed over for several job opportunities and found most social events stressful. (I’ve seriously had potential employers tell me that my resume is great and my skills are amazing but my completed questionnaire showed signs of depression so they’ll have to pass.)
  
 

  In my late 20s, I was hit by a drunk driver on my way home and sustained several injuries that made working a regular job difficult. It was during my pursuit to be “normal” that I leaned heavily on various opioids to alleviate my pain and manage my anxiety. I was seeing a therapist during this time but quit because I was growing more and more paranoid about what my therapist was writing in his notes about me. I soon took up the mantra that no one wants to hear my problems and started eating. I eventually weighed close to 200 lbs doing this. It was during my mid-30s (and still eating) that I started dating my first boyfriend. 
  
 

  After years of only being able to land odds jobs due to my disability, anxiety, and depression, I’ve decided to start my own business as a balloon decorator. After years of trying to work in the sciences (lab technician, lab assistant, middle school teacher), I wanted to pursue something fun in the arts because it would showcase my creativity. 
  
 

  The anxiety I’ve been dealing with for the last month or so stems from the feeling that I’m wasting my time with _everything_. While I’ve been told numerous times that my work is stunning, I think it’s subpar and I often struggle to get anything completed without wanting to start over repeatedly. The counselors I contacted to help me establish my business love the business plan I gave them and love the business aspects I’ve done thus far but I feel like I’m wasting my time and money doing all this stuff. [The only past job I had that I loved involved being alone 6 of the 8 hours I worked every day (damn Covid).]
  
 

  I decided to see a therapist and seek meditation after I experienced myself spiraling during a conversation with my boyfriend. He expressed wanting me to move in with him which made me panic. Between my disability flaring up fiercely in the last week, the fear of my business idea being a flop despite my best efforts, and the only boyfriend I’ve ever had wanting to see more of me than he does now, I started feeling jittery and couldn’t think straight. 
  
 

  I’ve been trying for weeks now to get a referral to see a therapist who can prescribe medications for my anxiety and depression if I need them. I think I really need medical intervention for what’s going on with me but the medical office is backed up with usual patient appointments thus I feel like I’m being brushed off again. 
  
 

  Am I wasting my time trying to see therapist for my anxiety and depression when it’s never really been addressed until now?"
"I'm considering doing a full blood test panel to rule out all physical causes of my anxiety disorder. I sometimes have the feeling that this isn't all in my head. 
  
 

  My main suspects are:
  
 

  \- Low testosterone  
  \- Vitamin D deficiency  
  \- Too much cortisol
  
 

  I'm pretty sure something is out of whack. But, the reverse could also be true. Anxiety leads us to have stress more often. And stress leads to low testosterone and mineral / vitamin deficiencies.
  
 

  So even if they would find low testosterone for instance, would that be caused by anxiety or the other way around?
  
 

  Anyway, I think it's a smart move. Just to rule it all out for once and for all. Anyone else ever done this? And did they find anything?"
"36F. Feeling guilty after spending 3 (!!!) hours in a Google spiral about a cancer I suddenly got paranoid about after some random symptoms. This cancer occurs in around 1-2 out of a million people. It’s not common at all and my barely relevant symptoms spiraled me. 
  
 

  I feel guilty and ashamed for doing this. I know Googling and body checking (if you have health related anxiety you understand all that!) are not helpful and a big no-no. I was doing well this morning… I cleaned my bathroom and tried being productive by journaling and reading as well. Then it all went to shit and I lost control. 
  
 

  Ugh. I don’t even know if people here can relate at all, but I just really needed a place to vent in a safe space. 
  
 

  Anyone else just get sucked into a Google/research spiral and can’t stop even though you know it’s not helpful and does more harm than good?"
"I'm spiraling internet people.
  I've been doing really well. 
  Than today showed up like it does every year since 01. 
  The week leading up and after are the worst. The rest of the year I'm able to push my feelings away.
  I'm sure like alot of people out there they went thru it.
  I took my CBD gummie this morning. 
  I've avoided social media as much as I could.
  I'm trying so hard to work thru my emotions without taking Valium. I don't want to rely on it. 
  I've been feeling so alone with my anxiety.
  I'm glad the intrusive thoughts have gotten way less, the pressure on my chest is less. But I still have my moments. 
  I'm just sick of it. Like why can't I just be normal. Go to work. Work out. Enjoy my hobbies. 
  But here I am constantly thinking of the bad things.
  I took NyQuil tonight because I have a sore throat. But I've been trying so hard to manage on my own.  
  My health anxiety is at its peak. 
  Anyone out there pushing thru and have some ideas to help?"
"Has anyone ever here found out why they are having anxiety in the first place? 
  
 

  Was it hormonal, or something else 'wrong' with the body or not functioning properly? Was it a traumatic experience (or maybe the first panic attack) that changed everything and set you off in the wrong direction? Was it something that grew over the years in a stressful or otherwise unfortunate time in your life? Is it genetic, i.e. parents also have it? Something else?"
"I’ve (35f) had generalized anxiety disorder for a majority of my life. I’ve been able to manage it pretty well as I’ve gotten older, but here’s my dilemma:
  
 

  I’m 30 weeks pregnant with my first child, and now that I’m in the final stretch the anxiety and intrusive thoughts are starting to come back. Thinking about the impending childbirth itself is anxiety-inducing, but on top of that, I personally knew someone who died shortly after giving birth due to sudden heart failure (peripartum cardiomyopathy), and now I’m worried something similar will happen to me. It doesn’t help that I have a mild heart valve condition. It’s not deadly, but having it, plus anxiety, makes me hyper aware of everything my heart is doing. I can’t stop falling down Google rabbit holes and making it worse. Reading that there’s no known cause, reading statistics, etc. Even when I try to focus on positive birth stories and calming strategies, my mind always whispers “but what if you die? You won’t get to see your baby grow up, your husband will have to take care of the family alone, etc. etc…” 
  
 

  I guess I’m just looking for some tips to stop my mind from spiraling, or even just to know that I’m not the only one who feels this way. 
  
 

  Thanks for reading if you got through all that. 😊"
"I'm 39. I have had what I consider a fairly healthy life. Never smoked or drank, I currently walk 2 miles every morning, and eat decently well. I have always had excellent blood pressure, even while pregnant.
  
 

  I began giving blood earlier this year and when they do the intake, my BP readings have been high (around 130 or low 140 something). Heart rate hovering in the 90's as well. I have no issues with giving blood, I don't feel nervous, etc. I have my own BP now and I've gotten some crazy (for me) readings, even hit 150 last Saturday. 
  
 

  I have an appt with my doctor for 9/26 to specifically talk about this. But now it seems I have full blown health anxiety. My heart rate goes up to 100 when I stand up and take one flight of stairs. I am borrowing my dad's Fitbit and sitting here it's only 88. But I can guarantee you as soon as I stand up to walk my daughter to the bus, it's going to go right back up.
  
 

  The symptoms for actual blood pressure issues and anxiety are really similar. What do you guys do to get through the day? Keep telling myself at the worst case scenario well, things would be dealt with. My family would be okay. But that's just crazy talk right? What are the chances it's something majorly wrong with me after years of being fine? Like for it to just crop up all of a sudden. 
  
 

  Some of the anxiety symptoms may also stem from years of built up stress over other stuff like student debt (thankfully now that's gone), being a mom of 3, etc. But to have to suffer with what feels like the edge of the physical panic attack most of every day for another 10 days seems difficult. I guess I'm just looking for validation from people who have experienced something similar."
"Just a question on people's thoughts in regards to meeting people/dating and relationships etc. Edit - 39M here.
  
 

  Like how the hell are we supposed to meet an understanding, potential significant other? Maybe it's easier if both people have anxiety.....or at least the other person has some empathy for what we go through.
  
 

  I guess y'all know what I'm saying...I'm just venting I suppose. For me I need someone who will understand what is happening when I have a panic attack, and why I can't watch my 12 year old nephew finish his basketball final because the pressure is far too much.
  
 

  Uughhh 😮"
"First off, I know I need to go to a Dr. And I am aware no one can give medical advice.
  I'm just so scared right now and need some reassuring. 
  I'm 36F.
  I've been dealing with anxiety and all thing anxiety related for the past 20y, but it's starting to kick my butt. My health anxiety has been absolute hell for me and I've convinced myself I have every deadly disease possible. I've learned to kind off differentiate between my anxiety and what is real but as soon as I have come to terms with something as just anxiety the next symptoms pops up. It's a unending battle.
  So lately I've been having what I'm thinking is heart problems. I know it's a common anxiety symptom but this is just too real. 
  I have what feels like left sided dull aching almost burning pains that come and go under my left breast. Then it kind of feels like it radiates to my back and shoulder. I have this spot on my back more to the left upper side that is sensitive. Feels like a aching muscle.my shoulder feels achy as well. This has been for a few days now.
  I've convinced myself it's Angina. Then I just made lunch today and was cleaning up the kitchen when a sharp stabbing pain radiated in the centre of my chest twice. 
  
 

  I'm dealing with all the anxiety related symptoms of fast heartbeat at times and what feels like missed beats for years. But this is just different.
  
 

  Can these symptoms really be anxiety related if im not even in a state of anxiety? 
  
 

  It's Sunday today so no Dr's are open and the closest hospital with a ER is more than a hour away. Small town problems.
  I'm alone with only my children and the thought of me dropping in front of them is terrifying. Do I make the drive? Is this anxiety? Are these symptoms even anxiety related if I'm in a calm state. 
  
 

  I've had a very stressful year so I know I've been stressed more than what I've ever been. But these symptoms just feel to real to just be anxiety?
  
 

  My grandfather passed away from a heart attack and my brother passed away from a heart attack at 50. So I know I have a family history and that just makes it more scary.
  
 

  Anxiety sucke. Can't I just have one normal day. This is debilitating. Never knowing what warrants a quick reaction and what is just anxiety related."
"Background:
  40 year old married male of 2 and one on the way, 
  Best friend fell off our dorm balcony at 18 and died in my arms. 
  Have had anxiety since and ocd most if my life. 
  Had a horrible reaction to Pfizer Vax - insane fasciculations throughout body - nervous system created autoimmune response and my antibody level is insane. Was prescribed heavy b vitamin and magnesium load and went b 6 toxic which mimics panic attacks and internal vibrating and peripheral neuropathy. Took a year to diagnose (while I continued to build additional b6 in blood). 
  
 

  This week I was trapped in an elevator in San Diego. 25 stories up. It fell to 12th floor over course of an hour in 3-8 ft increments I’d guess. I was alone. Scared as hell. Body was trembling and twitching. I needed to cry/sob but held it in with strangers around me. 
  
 

  All week I’ve felt a bit on edge. Just overwhelmed. Fasciculations returned. Exhausted. But I’m happy. I am so blessed. My body just doesn’t act like it! 
  
 

  Psych wants me to take tiny doses of Klonopin to calm my nervous system. I also have proporanalol. Has anyone taken these just to reset after a traumatic event like this? I had them last year when I thought I was having panic attacks (was actually Vax and b6 toxicity but it worked regardless to help me sleep)."
"Ok, so I gave up alcohol and drugs 10 years ago, but still have a daily caffeine addition, I drink tea and coffee.
  
 

  
 

  When I was a drinker I used to meet and talk to women easily, but since I quit I can never break into social circles and start relationships. If I go to a party which is rare, I go home early because of anxiety, boredom, just as the other people drinking are starting to have fun. I have become more introverted and usually socialise with just 1 or 2 good close friends.
  
 

  My impression is that women only value men who are in a social circle. They seem to get into a social circle first and then attract towards the top men in that social circle, if he is confident and charismatic and social he will be more popular. Any thoughts or advice welcome. I am 38 and still looking for a good relationship. Thanks!"
"I'm 39m, high-school drop out, pot head for life, working shit jobs Making shit pay all my life. A real classic Beavis and butthead booze, pot, and video games kinda guy. Fuck it, no problem, pedal to the metal.
  
 

  Then I have this supportive wife who somehow supports me through the past 12 years together, 8 years married, who also has alot of mental health issues, but we've stuck together through the years. She has no substance abuse problems. 
  
 

  All of a sudden she lands this awesome job, making way more money than I could. We decide it'd be best for me to quit my job, play house wife and have only her work, me only do chores and house stuff. We have no kids and 6 cats. No debt.
  
 

  Next thing we know we have saved and are buying a brand new house, 3 times bigger than anything we've ever imagined. Plenty of cash. We sold our old house and made a killing. And here we are on the event horizon of our new lives. It's time for me to kick it into high gear, handle the moving and organization shit and help us get our lives together. I quit drinking and smoking cigarettes and focus on living a better life preparing for our new house.
  
 

  Here we are now, I've quit drinking and smoking but not without tripling my weed intake to suffice. I was happy, active, caring for the house and the cats, cooking dinner, losing weight, just killing it compared to the little Beavis I've always been, and I felt like a new person for a few months. But then boom.
  
 

  All of a sudden the weed isn't helping anymore and my anxiety has been crippling me daily. I'm supposed to be better now. Not because we have more but because I've stepped up to the plate and set aside some of my biggest shit problems to make room for becoming a better person, and I was. I was better and I was proud of it.
  
 

  Well slowly, over the past week or so I can feel the anxiety and depression creeping back in. I snapped today and bought a 12 pack. After 1.5 years of complete abstinence it was magically the solution answer for today. I am ashamed. Sucks cause I feel great now that I'm relaxing. The sweet booze is melting away the anxiety but I can feel my coordination and IQ dropping by the moment.
  
 

  I'm just so bummed you can make it so far and just shit your pants right back to square one after a few weeks of feeling terrible. Will I drink again tomorrow? Probably not. But will I drink the next time my anxiety becomes inmanagable?? I'm afraid it is helping me short term today, and that is all my addict brain will rember next time I feel this bad. Sitting here feeling terrible despite there being nothing wrong. Everything is fine,better than ever in everyway; except the way I feel inside today.
  
 

  I'm 39. I've fought for my peace my entire life, and apparently the only place it lives is the crossroads of consciousness and intoxication where the mess of a person I am fades away into something I can ignore long enough to have a goodnight. 
  
 

  Just sharing as an outlet. Thanks for your time"
"My anxiety is very situation-dependent. At home, I feel fine. Having an appointment with someone / something where I have to sit down for an hour, not so much...
  
 

  I start to think that maybe a beta blocker is a good medication for me. To take it once per week or so before I have to do something which sets my anxiety off to help with the physical symptoms. I'm pretty sure it's my physical symptoms of anxiety which set me off even further. On top of feeling very uncomfortable. It sounds good on paper.
  
 

  But, of course I am worried about the side effects and how it will make me feel. I sometimes have a resting heart rate of 51-54. What happens when I take a beta blocker, leave the stressful situation and go home? Might my heart rate get 'too' low? Dizziness? Etc?
  
 

  Can someone share me their experience with them? How does it make you feel? How do you feel during the stressful event? And after? For how many houors do you feel them having an effect? And which one do you take?
  
 

  Thanks!"
"I'm 37 years old. Never had a license, and before these past few months, I'd hardly even practiced. I'm married with a 12 year old daughter and we are uprooting out whole lives to pursue an opportunity in another state. Where I live now is very rural. Schools and stores are all less than a mile from me. Our new location is in the middle of the desert and everything is FAR and it's hot as hell.
  
 

  My husband and I decided he should move first and start his new job so that our daughter can finish this school year here. Before he left, he helped me practice and really boosted my confidence. I feel I've progressed so much.
  
 

  When my husband left, I had to depend on my dad to help me keep practicing. I have a not so great relationship with my dad and one lesson with him on parallel parking just absolutely destroyed my confidence. I ended up running a red light because he wouldn't stop berating me. 
  
 

  I kept going though. I keep driving with him or my mom here and there and I keep pushing and going. I thought about paying for a few 1-hour lessons, but I think I'm just gonna go for it and schedule my first test for this coming Tuesday. Wish me luck and any tips are welcome.
  
 

  Finding this sub was a freaking miracle for me. It's helped me so much. I may not have my license yet, but I don't think I would've even made it this far without reading y'all's posts and comments. Thank you&lt;3"
What do you think is the best dating app for people who have social anxiety? I’m 39f (nearly 40) and have never had a long term relationship. Online dating has been hard and full of rejection but I can’t see another way of meeting someone to date. I wonder if the ‘no past relationship’ thing is an issue in itself to a potential date (?) but I really want to meet someone and it’s too painful thinking I might have missed my chance
"I was going to do some lessons before taking my road test but I said f*CK it, I'm just gonna do it AND I PASSED! I can't believe it! 
  
 

  Of course I also almost went into the ditch backing the car into my driveway when I got home 😅 but I still passed! I'm gonna relish this moment before the self doubt and anxiety sets back in! 
  
 

  I couldn't have done it without this subreddit!! Thank y'all!!! ❤️❤️❤️"

"new life, new marriage, new city, anxiety at its peak
  
 

  I am 35 F, have gotten remarried and he is a wonderful man, couldn't ask for better. I have a 7 year old daughter who has also built a bond with him. He is everything i wished for and more.
  
 

  We have moved to a new city and its very depressing leading to my anxiety and nervousness.
  
 

  I quietly went to a cardiologist too but my ekg was fine.
  
 

  But i feel racy heart, palpitations, fatigue, not too happy and just negative as i hate it here so much .
  
 

  I can't even tell my family and i don't want depression and anxiety to spoil my relationship:(
  
 

  It's so disheartening, in my native city i had all my bloodwork from thyroid to kidney panel to lipid to numerous ekgs , everyone says it's anxiety .
  
 

  Btw i take proponol 40mg once a day and have clonazepam as sos but i try avoiding it.
  
 

  I feel so low and feel like crying while writing this.
  I want to beat anxiety and be like other normal people."
"I am a (36m) foreigner. Live in USA. I am also a cop. I feel very isolated. On one hand I get rejected by conservative community for being a foreigners ( including my coworkers and i deal with discrimination on daily basis) on the other hand I get rejected by lebral community for being a cop. I know quitting my job will fix half the issues. But that would take time. What would you advise me? 
  
 

  
 

  I have completely lost faith in people after what I have gone through. I also don't have any family. Of the above issues contributed to not having any friends.
  
 

  Like when I meat someone who's conservative they walk once they hear my accent or my foreigner name and when I meat a liberal person they walk away once they know I am a cop."
"I am a 36 year old Male who weights 290 pounds, and about four days back my heart rate suddenly plummeted from being on the higher end at rest to suddenly 45-50. I keep waiting for it to change but it will not. I went to the emergency room and they gave me all sorts of blood tests, ekg, xray and came back that even though this is happening there is nothing they can do at this moment and that I will need to see a cardiologist. It is going to take a while to get an appointment and see one and my fear that I am going to die is not going away. I wish I could calm myself down but my mind is entirely wrapped up in my heart rate. I constantly am checking it on BP cuff, multiple oximeters and hoping it will change. It isn't changing if anything it might be even a little worst now today and staying at 45 more than 50. I just want my heart rate to go back to normal. The anxiety surrounding this is overwhelming and I have posted to pretty much every medical subreddit in hopes anyone could help me. I feel like crap, tired and alone."
"I understand how panic attacks work. I am really trying to just keep on doing things, accept the physical symptoms and not catastrophize. But the nervousness is at an all time high, everytime I undertake something.
  
 

  This week I did:  
  \- Went to a town / shop by myself just to get out there - slight nervousness  
  \- Went to a restaurant for dinner with family - Heavy nervousness  
  \- Had a friend over - Medium nervousness  
  \- Shot a wedding (it's my work) - Hours and hours of nervousness  
  \- Picked up family from the airport (3 hours drive in total) - Heavy nervousness
  
 

  This week I lost buckets of sweat and became a year older. I really need to do something, but I don't know what. Yea i know what helps: sitting at home. The moment I am home, boom, all symptoms gone. Couldn't even have a panic attack here if you paid me.
  
 

  I've tried and am trying still  
  \- Daily meditation  
  \- Supplements: L-theanine 200 mg daily - Magnesium Glycinate 200 mg - Tumeric extract 500 mg  
  \- More sunshine / less sitting inside  
  \- Lemon grass tea  
  \- Reading books about panic  
  \- Had online sessions with a psych last year
  
 

  And of course the regulary exposure. It just doesn't seem to work. And lately the symptoms are much heavier than before. 
  
 

  Why could that be?
  
 

  And what can I still try? And if I were to go for medication, which one would you recommend? So just to be clear, i only have panic / nervousness when I'm out of my safe zone and usually with other people. So it's not constant. At home I'm pretty happy and relaxed.
  
 

  I don't really want to go down the SSRI road. Would those actually be the most suitable? Or anything else I should give a go?
  
 

  Thanks everyone. I'm at the end of my wits. The constant negative experiences are so draining."
"I need something that makes my physical symptoms of anxiety less severe. I'm already trying L-Theanine, turmeric extract, magnesium glycinate and vitamin D. But to no avail so far.
  
 

  I've read here that there are people who greatly benefitted from methylated B-vitamins. But, there is also a big group for who this only made their anxiety even worse!
  
 

  Naturally, I'm not exactly interested in the latter so I wonder what is the best approach here. I am probably not deficient in B12, since I eat eggs, meat and dairy daily. 
  
 

  But what about B1 / B3 / B6? Should I just give it a go? What is your experience?"
"Very weird symptom of my anxiety. 
  
 

  I am pretty slim but have a small protruding belly when I stand in a normal / relaxed manner. Maybe 5-10 lbs to much on my frame, so nothing really special. I also don't do this 'consciously'.
  
 

  So, when I'm with other people or even just picking up my kids from school, I find myself standing there with a tensed and sucked in belly. When I notice it, I immediately 'manually' relax my stomach muscles. But a minute later, I find myself doing the same thing again.
  
 

  It's like an automated response and I wonder what could be the cause of this. Is it my body 'bracing' for danger, for a blow to the stomach? Kind of like a self protection mechanism? Or could be that I am deep down very insecure and want / need to present myself in the best manner as possible?
  
 

  It is also not a good habit because it fuels my anxiety even further. Tensed muscles means shallower (chest) breathing and overal poor posture which probably makes my other anxiety symptoms worse.
  
 

  Anyone recognizes does or can shed some light? I can't seem to kick the habit, no matter how many times I manually relax my muscles. Thanks!"
"Today I saw a potential job opportunity (I am employed but severely underpaid) and while I was excited it was short lived as I found out it was an MLM scheme. I (39M) was discussing this with my gf (35F) and she told me I have to keep pressing on. I reminded her that I have to juggle my current job, a job search, my chronic migraines, my kids, and her, and although she is usually compassionate, I feel like she just didn't get it. We are very close and we want to move our relationship forward and be able to move in together, which I need a better job for, but pushing it like that just makes me so anxious. I already know I need a better job, but I literally can't think during a migraine episode, and they are very frequent. I am honestly at a loss for what to do, she has never done this before but it got so deep under my skin. I really needed to get this out and see what other people thought about it."

Does anyone else that suffers from anxiety deal with this? I had an amazingly calm day today. Woke up a little later. Continued packing my apartment for my move. Sat outside with my pup. Watched a TV marathon. Did my daily meditations. All in all calm. No anxiety. I get into bed. Drink my sleepy time tea. I sorta fall asleep at 11...and I've been in that weird sort of asleep state since. Like that really weird hazy I'm sleeping but not state. I finally just sat up at 3 am. My heart racing. I feel hot. Chest hurts. I'm slightly in a panic. Now I just feel off. It's almost 4am now.anf I can't settle. I would take a Valium but I don't want to waste them. Has anyone else ever dealt with this? I'm glad it's Sunday today so I don't have to deal with being tired all day at work. But. Anyone else?

"I usually feel pretty good at home. No nervousness, no physical symptoms. Just enjoying my life.
  
 

  When I go do something outside of the house that involves other people or situations where I'll be physically or socially trapped however, my anxiety skyrockets. Boom, instant adrenaline injection that keeps coming in waves for the duration of the activity. Nervousness, dizzyness, shallow breathing, tensed muscles, sweating like a pig, etc.
  
 

  Again, when I leave the situation and turn back home. Boom, instant chill pill.
  
 

  Anyone else with the same pattern? I guess this is how one would develop agoraphobia. I keep pushing myself to get out there though. It's just getting harder and harder lately. How is this for you?"
"I’ve read some people stating that their anxiety improved when they stopped consuming dairy products or gluten.
  
 

  I wonder if I should give that a try. However, I have no symptoms of indegestion or anything related to the stomach / intestines / throat area. And i dont feel better or worse after consuming either.
  
 

  My anxiety symptoms only present themselves in certain situations as well.
  
 

  So maybe it’s a long shot. Anyone else with experience?"
"After years of crippling anxiety/depression, I can't help but think more and more that it is not worth living life this way. 
  
 

  I have been on different medicine for years. I am married with kids. I have my own business. I have no reason to feel this way. Yet I do. I'm 36 YO and just so so tired of the heaviness of it all. I can't get out and go places anymore because of it. It makes it hard to work and I feel so so so sorry for my kids who have to witness this side of me even though I try to hide it constantly.
  
 

  Crying constantly, freaking out on the inside till I can't get out of bed.....I don't want this to be me!!!!!!
  
 

  Any advice? I could switch up my meds, I've been on zoloft for 6 years now. 
  
 

  It's hard to keep going. The only thing keeping me here is my duty to my family. I love them very much, but find joy in nothing. Only hopelessness and despair. Helplessly doomed to live forever like this.
  
 

  Thanks for letting me vent."

"I am 35 years old , drowning in debt due to medical issues and bad decisions.  
  I am super anxious right now, I can barely breath right now. I don’t what to do , I feel like I am worthless, I want to die . 
  I just want to stop but I still feel this pit in my stomach. 
  I don’t want to be here anymore. I am doing IOP but it is far away and I to take multiple buses which in itself is discouraging me , I’m short term disability getting paid my partial salary. I feel so alone , maybe I should give up IOP and go back to work even though I am still in need of treatment. Oh man I want to die for real , it’s been 4 years of bad suffering and nothing as helped, medication , 1x1 therapy, I have tried so hard. I put myself on a budget once I go back to work I will add a part time job to pay off past due payments and future payments."
"Hi everyone, I am 37 years old and have been battling anxiety (with depression coming later) since I was about 23. First I turned to diet and exercise which did help but as years went....I can't hold down a job that isn't optional like substitute teaching (what I have been doing), can't go anywhere alone (I have always used someone to go with me) and just the idea of doing either of those things causes me to stress, get angry at others and then have issues breathing. 
  
 

  I had considered medication but the thought of medicine scares me into a panic im just so tired of life passing me by. My parents keep telling me I should have a career by now and that they are embarrassed that other family members do while I don't. Its not from lack of trying, I have applied for jobs, I'm a great substitute and I have my bachelors degree its just applying and keeping the job that I have trouble with. 
  
 

  Anyone else in the same spot or have a similar issue? Sometimes I feel like I am alone with this."
"I was born without enamel on my teeth. Had to get caps immediately. All of those ""fell"" out. I had to remove them on my own because the bits of metal would get stuck in my gums. Was never taught oral hygiene nor was it enforced at all. Had all 4 molars as crowns by 19. I'm 35. My front teeth are eroding from the back, not visible yet but it's only a matter of time. My one side that I'm able to eat with, the only teeth that matched up, just had a crown fall off. My insurance covers 2k. I made mistakes when I was young and credit isn't an option. I need tens of thousands of dollars worth of work. I'm tired of hurting. I can't brush my teeth because my old work falls out when I do. My worst fear is currently coming true. I hate myself for writing this, but it's my truth. Things will work out one way or another, I know that, but this may be the straw that breaks any sense of stability I had.
  
 

  On top of all of this, I have to have a testicle removed later next month because of a cancer scare. I have no idea how I am going to do this. I feel hopeless.  
  
 

  Please brush your teeth and for the love of all things holy check your balls."

"So I finally moved into my first home today.very little food was consumed. I tried to remain hydrated. 
  My body feels off and my right arm is sort of tingling. 
  I took half a Valium around 4. I feel a little better. But I'm super freaked out I'm having a stroke or a heart attack. 
  I'm 39. Relatively healthy. Was in the ER a few weeks back and they ran all the tests including cat scan of my brain and everything came back nominal.
  I wish I could just enjoy the fact I bought my own house instead of sitting on the couch thinking the worst.
  Any be advice. Thoughts."
"So I (36f) have been struggling with this for such a long time, so I will start by saying the smallest thing can trigger my anxiety to go through the roof, and it's all around the same thing, death. I am scared of dying. I feel so stupid. I get the slightest of pains or something and I instantly think I am dying, I know this is hypochondria, and I know how it all started. I am also seeking professional help to deal with it, but it is very early days. My anxiety is the worst at night, when I am alone with my thoughts. I'm not able to sleep at night anymore which has affected my life drastically, I have not been able to work full time in a long time. I know I will get better the more I get help but right now I am scared and I hate feeling this way ALL THE TIME"
"After several years of putting off a true job search due largely to migraines I am finally (physically) well enough to work on sending out job applications. I am working on the first one now, which really shouldn't make me too anxious as I am highly qualified for it, but I am anxious as hell. I'm doing everything I (think) I can: taking breaks and pacing myself, mindfulness, meditation, journaling, etc, and using my meds, but the anxiety won't let go. If I am this anxious over a job I'm well qualified for, how will it be when I go to transition (academic job to industry)? If anyone has any suggestions I'm all ears."
"I'm a 37M who has had a long term relationship with Anxiety for 17 years. While married for 11 years to my wife 34F. It surprising I was able to keep both relationships going for this long.
  
 

  Anxiety has made things difficult for my wife, it has led to moments of being snappy and irritable towards her. It has had me cry like a baby or get angry and upset like a toddler around her. It has stalled any hopes of adventure for her.
  
 

  But Anxiety has indirectly pushed me to be a better person, it taught me out of necessity the importance of meditation and mindfulness. It encouraged me to more understanding of others, allowed me to express my own vulnerabilities through shadow work and in many ways improve my methods of communicating to others.
  
 

  More recently it has led me to work out and I dare say I am in the best shape of my life....mind you all of these activities meant I saw less and less of anxiety as that was my intent. It was a curse I wanted to get rid of that required the blessing of doing all the things one should do to get rid of it.
  
 

  But one area where anxiety likes to show its public display of affection towards me is when going to places, such as being in unfamiliar surroundings or people. All the things that my wife wants more of. So naturally she feels cheated on, she has been cheated out of a life of spontaneity and adventure because anxiety always seems to have its way with me.
  
 

  So the exclusivity for her has worn thin, she now speaks of coparenting which stings, however when she talks about the possibility of our kids having a step father who takes them out and goes on vacations. It feels like a punch to the gut and a bullet to the head.
  
 

  I don't know the point of this post, maybe I just want to be heard. To be told it will be alright. All I know is there is no place for anxiety because it will be depression who is sleeping in my bed tonight."
"So I am settling at very busy bar with alot potential to talk to others. I really dont feel like I have anxiety. But i so just want to go home and just set and watch TV. I feel like I just don't belong here. I don't know what this feeling is? Or why?
  
 

  Especially for someone who have no Frinds or family. You would think I would appreciate places like this Soni can make friends"
"I'm 38F and have struggled with feeling like an outcast my whole life, and since COVID I've struggled even more with social anxiety.
  
 

  I cancelled social plans on Thursday and Friday. Tonight I'm supposed to go to a friend's birthday party and I'm freaking out and I don't know why. It's not like I feel excluded--I was literally invited, and was invited before other people, so it's not like I was invited ""just because."" It's a small gathering and I know most of the people who will be there. One of them even contacted me this morning to confirm the details and make sure I'd be there, and honestly I've been even more anxious since then. I just feel like ""whats the point? They won't even notice if I'm not there, no one will miss me"" and I can't get past that.
  
 

  Why do I feel excluded even when I'm very obviously being included? What is that? I'm really trying to get a handle on this because it's getting out of hand...it's like I need an engraved invitation and everyone telling me how much they want me there before I can go anywhere, wtf..."
"I am 35 now and got my first panic attack at 21 at an internship. I had to present something and I flipped from normal nervousness to complete panick. It escalated fast and my doctor prescribed me 3 weeks of leave, saw a shrink and she gave me cymbalta and a shitload of Xanax. Looking back now, both made a mistake: the 3 weeks at home was encouraging avoidance behavior, and the Xanax I started taking to finish my internship made me completely addicted. benzo detox I'd not fun. Luckily, I had a good therapist. He gave cognitive behavioral therapy and encouraged me to go out there and do things. He was nice, but I kept thinking ""you don't knie what panic is"". After I moved I got a new GP, who made me feel guilty about taking meds. Luckily, she was gone after a bit. My new psychiatrist is superb - takes plenty of time, discusses effects, and changed me to Lexapro. I sought a new psychologist and went with someone who actually had panic disorder, and focussed on mindfulness. I thought it was a bit fluffy but I was so hard on myself. . I was stuck in an anxiety loop. Over the years I've had other psychologists, one was an absolute hard-ass, my current one is a doll. 
  
 

  My triggers? Physical sensations (warm face, heart pounding, tingling fingers, a tight band around my chest, and panic breathing) and social situations. Everything from getting on a bus to queuing in the supermarket was panic attack worthy, and I was dead tired at the end of the day
  
 

  Where am I now? I'm okay. Panic is in my life but it doesn't rule it anymore. Last week I gave a speech in front of 300 people. I coach others now in public speaking. Because I've been so down, I understand people's nerves and anxiety better.
  
 

  Here is what helped me:
  
 

  1. Realize that not every doctor is the one for you. You need to find the balance between getting pushed but also advised to take a break.
  
 

  2. When my therapy began, it was all about my avoidance behavior. I had gone from my first panic attack to not leaving the house anymore in weeks. I learned in baby steps to go back out. Walk to the end of the block and back.
  
 

  3. I've spent years waking up with anxiety thinking I can't do this. My second therapist taught me to divide everything into steps. Just get up and put your clothes on, that's it. Succes? Why not eat a bite. Success? Get ready for work, it's not because you do your hair that you actually have to go outside.
  
 

  4. Make a distinction between strangers who you can ignore, and people you need. Panicking in a public location? Sit there until it passes, don't flee. Odds are no one will notice it, and who cares anyway, they're strangers! Other people you have to talk to. Your roommates, partner, a desk colleague, a good friend. I lied at first but that made everything worse. In a moment where you are calm, work out two things: 1) explain ""panicbrain"", how your thoughts escalate, how it's different from nerves, how rationality can't control it. 2) a plan to share with those near you on what they should do if they notice you freaking out. Talk to them when you're calm. My colleague would get up, fetch me some water and put a hand on my back. I felt recognized but the attention wasnt drawn to me. When you start talking openly to people, it becomes normalized. And you'll see how many people tell you in confidence about similar issue
  
  5. This is fucking tiring. You're fighting your own brain.. Recognize that and cut yourself some slack. Start with small steps and build up. Never compare with others. You are fighting a much larger fight. And to be honest, everyone has issues 
  
 

  6. After 14 years I have finally found exercises that work. I'll stick to the important one. You need the free app ""Kardia"" (purple icon). 
  It is the first thing I've encountered that actually lowers my stress levels (and accompanying headaches and migraines and muscle tension) and I have been able to make a panic attack stop when I felt it starting, which has never ever happened before.
  Background: heart coherence therapy (scientifically proven to work and damn, first tool in a decade that has actually made me calmer). Underlying idea: if the connection exists between our brain and our other systems (stress signals activating elevated blood pressure, rapid breathing, tight feeling on chest) we can use that connection the other way around as well: if we lower our breathing, our brain gets signals that everything is okay and stops producing the fight or flight reflex hormones.  
  Important: how to breathe with the app:  
  1) Breathe in through the nose as the orb expands
  2) There generally is a moment at the full breath-in phase where we take half a second to not do anything - hold breath
  3) breath out via the mouth, but -&gt;slow and controlled&lt;-, as if you're blowing through a straw.
  It resets your anxiety breathing to a better place, which tells your brain everything will be okay. Following the expanding orb us also hypnotizing, which stops the brain escalating thoughts.
  
 

  Am I cured? No. But I've gone from social recluse to public speaker. It took me years and years, but every time there was an opportunity to present something, I volunteered. Again and again and again.. I workedso hard, crying while going on stage, crying at work, panicking in the bus. But fuck, years of battling and I kinda made it? I'm still on antidepressants by the way.
  
 

  Sorry for the long post. If you have questions, shoot."
"I swear people just don't care anymore. I could have posted this in r/jobs or r/professors, but I thought I would find a more understanding community here. I applied for a one year teaching position at a local liberal arts college. I received an email today with instructions on how to get my ID card and parking permit. I was so excited but thought it was weird that I didn't hear that I was hired, so I called the contact on the email. She fumbled around for a while and you could tell she hardly knew the name of who was hired, let alone me, and didn't apologize for the mixup. I was mostly hurt because of the excitement I had for landing a new job falling to pieces, but the anxiety of it all, especially thinking my search was over, and the indifference! Job hunting sucks and just makes anxiety worse!"
"So I'm pretty new to the anxiety business. I'm 35 and haven't really had much that I can recall. I've always been a naturally high strung and somewhat anxious person, but a few months ago I had a full blown episode where I could barely sleep for days, couldn't keep food or water down, and just generally didn't feel like myself. It was terrible. A few weeks into it, I got some CBD and CBN for night and it helped. I've been fine for the past 2 months, but noticed I started feeling a little anxious a few days before my period. Then my period started and I started having sleep anxiety again. I'm tired, but when I lay down, I get these zings of adrenaline that prevent me from falling asleep. I've always read that you shouldn't just lay there when you can't sleep, but I'm at a loss for what else to do. Any tips for what to do in the middle of the night when everyone is asleep but you??"
"I (35F) have dealt with anxiety since i was young, to varying degrees, and i had HORRIBLE postpartum anxiety. I have since got through the worst of it, and I am now adjusting to life as a mom and it is hard. 
  
 

  I know having a child just inherently adds a new level of fear/concern for life, but some of this is debilitating.
  
 

  Everything I do away from my baby (a year and a half old) terrifies me. I keep thinking I am going to die, whether in a car accident or a some freak occurrence, and leave my baby without a mom, which obviously devastates me. If my husband and I are together, I am terrified we will both die and leave our baby an orphan. If we’re all together, I worry we’re going to die and thinking of my baby suffering is traumatizing. 
  
 

  It’s at the point where I never want to go anywhere and especially never be without my baby. I do fight it and live a mostly normal life, but I just hate living with the weight of these fears.
  
 

  I don’t even know if this is anxiety but I don’t know how to fix any of this and it’s so unsustainable 😓"
"I've heard from people how this greatly helped their anxiety. I don't think I have any digestive issues with dairy though since I've been consuming it whole my life, but I think I should give it a shot.
  
 

  Now I've also started weight lifting and I take a protein shake 2x a day of which one of them is a whey protein shake (since it has the best amino acid profile). Do you think I should cut that out as well? My Whey protein is an isolate and so does not contain any casein nor lactose.
  
 

  Is there anything else in dairy / milk that could cause the anxiety? 
  
 

  Thanks!"

My friend didn’t finish his food because he didn’t like it. But he asked for a to-go box, and even told me he was just gonna throw it away. I said ""why are you getting a box then?"" It was because he was anxious that the waiter would think he didn’t like it. I never ask for to-go boxes because I’m anxious the waiter will think I'm poor. Same situation, two completely different interpretations leading to anxiety. Neither of them true. The waiter doesn’t care!"
"We are a tough crowd, I know. But most of us want to connect to others and have trouble with that. I have found this Reddit very helpful and I think we can do more to help each other.

I've been thinking about community ideas and I wonder what you guys think and also if you have any suggestions or if people would like to help out. 
  
 

  Here are some of the ideas I have:
  
 

  * **Awkward Anonymous** as a name :D
  * Sharing circles where we share and if we want to, get advice 
  * Legal lurking: you can just hang around and not say anything if you want
  * Practicing presentations and role-playing job interviews
  * Weekend and holiday meetups for whoever feels lonely or just wants to hang out
  * People who have improved a lot sharing their journey and answering questions
  * Accountability and support for habits you want to form or challenges you want to take on
  * Keeping things [structured](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/the-effect-of-situational-structure-on-the-social-performance-of-) so there is less anxiety (I dislike being put on the spot to say something about myself :p) 
  * Maybe playing games together or watching shows/movies
  * Sharing tools and strategies that lower anxiety 
  
 

  I do want the goal to be *preparing for real-life social interactions* rather than a replacement for them, but of course, you can form cool relationships online too. It would be nice if it's in collaboration with this subreddit, so we have a good chance of keeping it alive :)
  
 

  Do you have anything to add to that? Or any critiques on the ideas I shared?"

"39M (Sweden), 177 cm, 90 kg
  
 

  Hey! Ok, I ask you to read below and try to put yourself in my situation.
  
 

  2021-04-13:
  Long story short. Had been suffering from a long-lasting cough (5-6 weeks) and sought care. The doctor heard something on the left lung and sent me for an urgent x-ray the same day. I was terrified and thought I had lung cancer. I was nervous and scared to death until I got my test results back. It showed nothing but I recovered a few days later.
  
 

  2021-09-14:
  My wife found a liver spot/mole on my back that looked weird. This after I had complained of itching in that place 1-2 months earlier. Thought it was skin cancer and was nervous and scared to death for several weeks before I received an answer that there was no danger. The mole didn't look ""bad"" so they didn't do anything about it.
  
 

  2021-10-07:
  My wife finds a lump on the right shoulder blade, size approx. 1x1 cm. It can be moved but feels strange somehow. Immediately becomes completely convinced that this is also a cancerous tumor. Either the skin cancer has spread or it is a sarcoma (soft tissue cancer that can feel exactly like a fatty lump). Once again, I became very nervous, stressed and scared to death. I sought care and was able to see a reputable doctor who informed me that it was a lipoma. When he was about to take it away, he says he can't find it. I imagined he saw it and it wasn't a lipoma. He said something to the other doctor and I didn't really understand where. He you catch me again and the lump is still there. Instead, he sends me for an urgent MR X-ray and here I am completely destroyed. I take him as if he has seen something that makes him not dare to cut me. I lie at home and shake for several days and have such fear of death that it is completely sick. I end up trying to go into that X-ray tunnel but it doesn't work. Tries 3-4 times but I just lie there and cry because I'm afraid of what the x-ray will show. Here I am completely convinced that it is cancer of some kind. I had to cancel everything and today the lump is still there. The doctor called me 3 weeks later and said he was 100% sure it was a lipoma and that it can stay on my body without doing any harm. So, I still have it and I'm alive.
  
 

  During this course of ""diseases"" I get hemorrhoids and start having stomach problems. I still have huge problems with my stomach (heartburn, acid regurgitation, irregular stools, stomach pain, stomach cramps, etc.).
  
 

  I'm simply wondering if this could be the result of some kind of stress, nervousness, panic disorder, death anxiety over an extended period of time?
  
 

  Note: I have never before had ""problems"" with my stomach (that I know of) but after the above events it is in total revolt.
  
 

  Please write a line or two what you think.
  
 

  Sorry for a long post, but it's important and nice for me to write a little.
  
 

  Thanks!"
I know there's a lot of these on here and I often comment on others posts but it seems I'm terrible at reassuring myself! For the last few months my anxiety has been really bad and I keep getting these weird physical symptoms that I don't remember having before (I've had anxiety for about 10+ years). Firstly I keep getting this odd feeling in my chest that will come out of nowhere and will even seem to happen when I'm not even aware I feel anxious. I suddenly become very aware of my heartbeat and it feels like it's pounding but not always fast. Then I'll feel like I need to take a deep breath or I'll start yawning like I'm not getting enough air. Then my chest will ache and I'll start feeling a bit sick/faint for a few minutes. I actually had an ECG and blood tests in the summer because I randomly fainted when picking my daughter up from school (it was very hot and I had barely eaten or drank all day as I'd been working and just forgot). I have noticed that I get these physical symptoms usually right after eating or when I'm on the school run now. Guess I'd just like some reassurance that this is just anxiety related and not a sudden problem with my heart! For context I'm 35 and healthy in most other ways (apart from forgetting to eat when I'm anxious!).
"I’ve been on Wellbutrin for a year and sertraline for 18 months or so. The Zoloft didn’t do much for me but the Wellbutrin added to the equation pulled me back on my feet. I was in a strange place after a bad Vax reaction and nervous system /immune system hyperactivity. 
  
 

  I had been in SSRI for ocd previously and it worked great. This just wasn’t ocd. 
  
 

  Thankfully Wellbutrin XL 150 was great. 
  
 

  The downside is I’ve gained 30 lbs in 15 months. I’m stable now and been reducing SSRI from 150 to 100 and stayed there for 3 months. Then 100 to 75 for 2 weeks. This week went to 50. Staying here for two weeks before 25 for another two weeks. 
  
 

  I caught a cold this week from my germ ridden children. My immune system and nervous system have been on hyper drive. Internal tremors and general heightened nervousness and anxiety. I’m nervous it’s the SSRI taper but I think it’s more related to the virus. I haven’t been taking consistent meds for the cold but a little nasal spray and cold meds and maybe that made me feel anxious? 
  
 

  Ahhhh. I just don’t want to go backwards. Any advice for taper? My psych is overseeing it. I trust her but wanna make sure. Anyone have issues tapering? Anyone else get anxious when they are sick? Cold meds/afrin/Flonase?"

"Does tapering too quickly lead to internal tremors or vibrations? Thought I was going very slowly. 
  
 

  Was at 150. Down to 100 over two months. Then stayed there 3 months. Then went to 75 for 2 weeks. And then just started 50. Within a week at 50 I started having vibrations and tremors like I was going to have a panic attack. Is this normal? I am thinking of bumping yo 62.5 for a week and decreasing in those smaller 12.5 stairs. 
  
 

  Any one relate to this? I have a cold too so trying to figure out what’s what- Cold or withdrawal."
"I’ve had social anxiety my entire life (40M). I don’t think I even realized how severe it was until it finally disappeared, but more on that later. I’ve also experienced lifelong depression but I think it was mostly an effect of the anxiety having limited my life in so many ways.
  
 

  About a month ago I decided to try ketamine therapy. I had been thinking about it for years, ever since articles about its effects on depression started being widely publicized. I signed up with Mindbloom, mainly because it would allow me to take the drug in my own home. The articles I read said that most people experience an immediate improvement in their depression symptoms. This was also said to me during my zoom consultations with Mindbloom.
  
 

  The ketamine session itself was unremarkable. I did not feel any of the dissociative effects that I was told would probably occur. After about an hour I experienced significant anxiety, which lasted for \~4 hours. Not panic attack levels, but levels that I haven’t felt in many years. I don’t really remember the next transition, but at some point I fell into a deep depression which lasted over two weeks. I could not stop ruminating. I didn’t leave the house for a week, and barely left my bed. I hardly ate. The depression was severe enough to include suicidal ideation, which I had not experienced in almost 15 years. I should have sought help at this point, but I didn’t. Also, many memories that I had long ago suppressed popped back into my head, which was scary and gave me even more things to ruminate on.
  
 

  Sometime in the third week, I started climbing out of the pit. I spent less but still significant time ruminating. I went for a short walk outside the house. I took a shower. By the start of week four I felt about the same as before the ketamine, which is to say not great, but at least functional. At this point I had another zoom call with Mindbloom, and told them what happened. They said it was rare, but does happen in people with “untreated trauma,” which certainly applies in my case. They said that I should go to therapy, and to consider proceeding with the additional ketamine sessions in the future, because it could still be beneficial. I was surprised they would say this given how bad my experience had been.
  
 

  Halfway through week 4 I started feeling a small amount of mania. I was energized and hyper. I met a friend for tea and was talking very fast the entire time. I recognized that I must be experiencing mania, which I have actually enjoyed a few times in the past as a reprieve from my usual depression. I decided to go out for dinner at a neighborhood bar. I said hi to an older couple seated next to me, and ended up having a long and fun conversation with them. I went home and slept. I assumed the mania would increase and last a few days, as it had in the past.
  
 

  But it did not. I woke up feeling calm. I went for a walk, and at some point realized I wasn’t walking with my head down. I went to get a cup of a tea at a cafe, and when placing my order, I made eye contact with the cashier. I smiled. I spoke my order clearly and more loudly than usual. When they asked for my name to put on the cup, I said it without the usual question mark at the end. I didn’t feel nauseous, I wasn’t sweating, my hands weren’t in my pockets, I wasn’t looking at the ground. I started getting very excited. I went to get a haircut and conversed with my hair dresser throughout the entire cut. Feeling a sort of high at this point, I walked to a clothing store. Normally I mumble “just browsing” to the salesperson. This time I said “I am looking for a jacket for weather like today.” And then I turned down 6 different options they showed me before finding one I liked. Normally I would have felt pressure to buy something I didn’t like, or would have left prematurely just to escape the anxiety. I won’t belabor the point further, but suffice to say, my social anxiety was effectively gone. At least for everyday, low risk interactions.
  
 

  It has only been a few days since the day I described above. I’m keeping a close eye on my anxiety. I think it may be coming back a bit but I’m not sure. I’m going to try and see a therapist asap. I hope they can give me a plan of action to hold on to my newly rewired brain. I’m very curious to try some higher stress social interactions, such as a date or group setting. 
  
 

  I feel like I just got out of prison after 40 years. At a logical level I am furious that I discovered this treatment so late in life. But I don’t FEEL angry. I actually feel what I think is hope, which is a very strange feeling."
"According to my Psychiatrist, this helps a ton with mental and overall well being and five 20 minute sessions a week works better than three. Been doing this and sleeping much better. Normally I take doxepin, fluvoxamine, temazepam, melatonin (big dose) and cbd to sleep. Been to the sauna like ten times or more in last two weeks. I am sweating harder and sleeping better. Last night took smaller ammount of melatonin and no cbd to sleep. Prayers and best wishes all."
"I (36f severe anxiety/bipolar 2) have no idea if this is just a me thing, but I have recently started bending my tongue back and sucking on it when I'm anxious, so pretty much always. I used to have an oral fibroma that formed from cheek chewing my entire life. I recently had it removed, and now I've started in on my tongue. It's causing splitting and super inflamed taste buds. Anyone else this weird and neurotic, or just me? Any tips for finding a different nervous habit? Please don't judge. I know I sound like a freak."
"I have pretty ridiculous ADHD. I was in trouble a lot as a kid for being impulsive, needing to be the center of attention, talking constantly, and lying frequently. 
  
 

  I'm 39 and medicated now, so some of it has changed, but I can't escape racing thoughts and constantly looking for shit to be worried about. I can't seem to stop churning through everything I've ever said or done. I feel like my ADHD brain wants me to feel guilty and anxious. I have also been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety. I dwell, stress, and worry. It feels like shit. I feel like these thoughts are sending me into another depression spiral where eventually I stop leaving my bed and answering my phone... and showering... and being a functioning human. I want to sleep all the time. When I'm asleep, I'm not guilt tripping myself or having hypothetical confrontations in my head with people from work or people I'm angry at. Lots of negativity. It's almost constant.
  
 

  I find myself doing multiple tasks at the same time to constantly keep my brain busy. Before this post, I was playing Fall Guys and watching tiktok in between rounds. Rapid fire distraction in between playing a game where focus is necessary. I also try to shut my brain down with weed. I keep using bandaids... 
  
 

  I should go back to therapy."
"My (37f) anxiety is through the roof this year. I worry constantly about my health but that's also because I have a lot of symptoms popping up.
  
 

  Now, it's my 4th night of being awakened by numbness. Not just hands and feet...but whole body! And i get a feeling of coldness in my hands and even stomach.
  
 

  Anyone else experience numbness during sleep and it turned out to be just anxiety?
  
 

  Don't worry. I have prepared my bag to go to the hospital in case i will experience it again. Just want to hear stories to calm me down a lil."
"I have 2 specific shows that I turn on when I start to have an anxiety attack or feel extremely stressed (if I'm lucky enough to be home at the time). I feel crazy for doing so, especially since I've seen both about a million times. It's almost like a safety blanket. Anyone else?

"You're doing well. You're still here and I'm proud of you. This will get better although I know some days that's hard to believe. Give yourself a break, it's tiring having to be so brave all the time. What do you need today?"
"So...if you see my previous posts , i have been struggling with anxiety for a very long time......a lot has happened too...my dad passed away a couple of months back ...my mom already dead....so 2 people i loved the most and felt most secure with gone has put me in an indefinite spiral

I have been dizzy for a week,then headache now i have earache too ..showed to an ent and she said it's a retracted ear...nothing else......in my heart i know it's nothing but my constant googling of diseases....now i want to see a nuerologist , get a CT scan but till when will I keep going this way???? ....doctors keep telling me i need a psychiatrist more than anyone else.......my constant worry about something or the other is wrong.....i am tired of this...i am sure my husband is....doctors laugh.......what to do????? I want to defeat this hypochondriac nature of mine before it's too late and lose people due to my nature........... please help .....i feel so dejected......a small flu is making me feel like i need to be hospitalized and i am dying.....i am so ashamed"
"Anxiety for years. Poor sleep. Low motivation. Sweating. No gains in the gym.
  
 

  So I decided to do a blood test for my hormones. Turns out my vitamin D is low, prolactin is elevated (yikes) and testosterone is borderline low. Like the level of a 75 year old man. (I am 37 / M)
  
 

  At the one hand I am happy. This means that it wasn't all 'in my head' and there might even be an actual cure! On the other hand I am frightened. Why are my levels so low? What is wrong with my body? Did the stress and poor sleep cause this? Or is it the other way around? And... Could it be a tumor of the pituitary gland? (not unlikely with this blood work)
  
 

  I'm going to increase my vitamin D, Zinc and activity level in the upcoming weeks and then do a retest of the bloods. Hopefully prolactin will go down and testosterone up. If not? Then I guess more hospital visits, tests and hopefully a fix for whatever is causing this.
  
 

  But as you probably can imagine, for someone with anxiety, this all sucks extra hard. 
  
 

  Just wanted to share. Any input would be appreciated. And also, if you have symptoms for a long time it might be wise to get your blood checked as well. Stay strong everyone."
"Trigger Warning ⚠️ (suicide)
  
 

  I've been debating whether or not I should ask this question or not. My fiancé says my Psychiatrist is 100% out of line but with him being the doctor I think maybe I just overreacting and my anxiety is just getting to me. So my fiancé said since l look to reddit for other advice for stuff ask about this also. 
  
 

  So a bit of backstory about me (35f), I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, c-PTSD, and depression. I struggled for years especially with horrible anxiety and panic attacks because my father didn't believe in panic attacks and my anxiety issues. I felt hopeful and in October/November 2019 I almost ended it all. I was in such a dark place I didn't want to keep on living. The only thing that stopped me were my dogs. I didn't trust anyone else with them. They are (one has since passed but I still have my little Yadi) my life. Until i met my boyfriend (my now fiancé) at the end of November, he truly pulled me out of the darkness. Even though I was 32 at the time, I was still living with my father because I can't work because I physically can't work because I have several autoimmune diseases. My dad had been supporting me since 2015 when I lost my job when I got fired from running out of FMLA and sick leave (yay America for being able to fire the sick and finding loopholes to also terminate their long-term disability they paid for, for just such situations, but I digress). But my relationship with my father fell apart when his new girlfriend of just a few months decided she didn't want me in the picture anymore and wanted me out. So she started to make my life a living hell. Sorry I'm getting off track but it's so therapeutic to talk about this sometimes. But to wrap it up things hit the fan a few months later with me and my dad's girlfriend. Even through my fiancé and I had only been dating a few months he said he had to get me out of there but since he apartment didn't allow dogs, what did the most amazing man in the world do. He bought me a house. So 2.5 years we moved in together. 
  
 

  
 

  So now to more present. With everything that went on with my dad and his girlfriend made my anxiety worse. It even caused me to now have a stressed induced heart issue, that I have to take a daily low dose beta blocker for or else anytime I have anytype of stress my heart rate will spike and I will pass out. Because of this I can no longer drive.
  
 

  I have become very dependent on my fiancé not because I want to but because I have no other choice. When I had the falling out with my father, I also had a falling out with my sisters with hurt my relationship with them also. I don't have anyone else to count on but him. Due to my autoimmune issues I am at the doctor's weekly. But in all honesty my fiancé has been the one person in my life who has never yelled at me, has never called me a bad name, has never made me feel small. He has been the first person in my life who has told me he was proud of me, who looked me in my eyes and actually listened to what I had to say and appreciated my opinion and did talk down to me. He makes me feel like I'm worth something. When I have anxiety attacks he sits with me and holds me and breaths with me until it's over and then holds me until I'm ready to talk or just sit with me. I've never has someone hold me while I had an anxiety attack, ever. 
  
 

  The only downside to my fiancé is, I have new and even worse anxiety when it comes to him. I am so worried something is going to happen to him. And this, finally, is the point of my post (thanks for hanging in). I worry everyday when he is at work. He is a merchandiser, so he travels from 3 to 4 stores a day. So he is on the road a lot. He is so wonderful putting up with my constant text checking up on him. I know it has to be annoying but he always tells me he doesn't mine. 
  
 

  This is where my anxiety gets to the max. Every morning he text me when he gets to his first store. Then I will text him back this exact message. ""Ok good. Have a wonderful day. 😊 Love y❤💋🥰😊😚☺️😍🤩😘💖💝💘💞❣️🥰😍😚☺️😊😘🥰💋❤"" Then I will send it. Then I will send 3 sticker emojis, I pick 3 different ones daily. I just pick which ones feels 'right' for that day. 
  
 

  Well when I brought that up for my Psychiatrist's meeting we have every three months, I figured he would have some words of wisdom, thinking this isn't normal, he simply told me to ""copy and paste, it will same you some time"" I told him it's not about time. If I don't send this message, if the emojis don't 'feel right', I feel like something bad is going to happen to my fiancé. This can't be normal. This isn't rational thinking. Again he said to just copy and paste. 
  
 

  Now I've only been seeing this doctor for just under a year. I've had a bad run of Psychiatrist and therapist over the last few years. I can go into the history of that in another post if you want to hear that horror story. Lol. 
  
 

  But my question is, is this grounds for finding, yet again, another Psychiatrist? Or am I overreacting? I only see him for meds. I really don't like him. I don't like how he treats me with how I'm treating my pain. I unfortunately need to ask him if he will prescribe me a med that helps with pain but he has to do it and not my pain doctor because it is under SSRI's and since I'm already on one, my pain doctor wants him to manage it. But I don't feel comfortable and I'm leaning towards the long journey of finding another Psychiatrist. Hell it only took me 8 months to find him. 😒"

"Hi everyone and I really appreciate any help/ attention here. My doctor prescribed Sertraline 50mg in the morning and Klonopin 0.75mg + Zolpidem 5mg sublingual before sleep.
  
 

  I suffer from depression, anxiety and chronic insomnia since I was a teen and today I'm 36 years old.  
  
 

  Since I started the medication I sleep between 5 and 6 hours at most and always wake up around 5am before the alarm (6.30am). I really feel throughout the day that is not enough sleep to continue living normally. 
  I'm an athlete and tried everything, including CBT-I, meditation, sleep restriction technique with a specialist etc.  
  
 

  Please, does anyone have any idea on how I could extend my sleep by another 1 or 2 hours? Perhaps the medication interfering with the sleep quality and efficiency? 
  
 

  Thank you for your help! 🫂🙏"

"I have been suffering from anxiety and depression since 18 years. I am 36 M. First of all it was really tough to even discuss my problem with anyone including my family as mental health is not a popular topic in India. 
  I went through phases where I would just stop functioning for 6-8 months and won’t even leave my room unless for food and supplies. It has been hell. And it’s tough to have a career and relationship when your mind is always working hard to scare you and make you second guess everything. 
  Consulted a few doctors and their prescriptions but never followed it through (as we anxious people almost never follow things through)
  
 

  I have had 3 attempts to end my life too. The latest one was in March this year. My sis booked my tickets and invited me to her place for a change of environment. She also forced me to see a psychiatrist and took me with her to see him. Meds were prescribed but this time something changed. I accepted that I needed help. I put faith in my meds. I switched off my phone for 3 months, stayed with my sis and followed my meds schedule religiously. 
  
 

  It’s been slow and steady but I am doing a lot better. Better than I have ever been since 2002. 
  This year has been like my rebirth. I still can’t help but feel sad sometimes thinking about how I have lost my youth and prime years to this mental daemon. 
  
 

  But I am grateful, happy, content. I have even started working out now and starting new business in 2023. I just want to say that it gets better if you can get good medical support and more importantly support and love of your family and friends. 
  Here’s to beating this horrible illness and looking towards a fulfilling and happy future."
"I'm someone that updates goals regularly and I write about them often, but still, the new year feels like a fresh start somehow. This year I have failed somewhat on my career goals, but I made big improvements in the social arena. I don't feel lonely and disconnected as often because I can be around people better even though I'm still tense. 
  
 

  My main goal is to become part of a community. There are different ways this could happen: 1) I could move to a community, currently in contact with an eco-village that focuses on social cohesion and sustainability 2) it could be professional, I'm training to be a videographer 3) it could be a hobby, I like to go bouldering. 4) or it could be one of those toastmasters public speaking clubs or something similar, people that help each other grow and hang out together.
  
 

  I know for some this may seem out of reach, but I think everyone has their own level of goals that they can work towards. If they are too lofty it can end up in depression (been there, done that) but sitting still doesn't feel right either. Curious if you guys have thought about this at all and what your goals or intentions are for 2023 :)"

"Told my gf the other night after dinner over text that I feel like she's been distant. Told her I'm not trying to argue just wondering if I did something wrong or if anything was bothering her and since I feel it it's best to speak it then bottle it up.
  
 

  She told me she'd rather I bring something up than ignore it. Nothing wrong or new going on. Idk maybe it's my fear of getting close to someone again. 
  
 

  She also said after that her depression doesn't help things either and it flares up for no reason sometimes. Meds help but sometimes she's not sad but not happy either.
  
 

  The next morning she texted, Good morning, wanted to let you know I really do want this to work. So I'm going to try to figure out how to be more present. I care a lot about you.

It has been happening for three months now, out of the blue. I am not scared socially, etc. I am not depressed.

"Hey!
  How you guys exercise with anxiety and panic attacks? I am afraid to do it because during exercise my heart rate is up and etc. Today I did low impact aerobic for 30 minutes and got dizzy anxiety and etc. Any tips? I did running for a few years but stopped 5 years ago because got panic attack during one run."
"Note: this was in response to the thought someone had that they will never find anyone and they will be alone forever and how could they learn to love themselves.
  
 

  So here's the thing right, you're assuming that finding someone else will make you happy when in reality, you're just going to be miserable together. Working on yourself is so so fucking important. So a little story for you, I almost killed myself (gun in hand and genuinely asking whether or not it was worth it) about 9 years ago.
  
 

  I don't say that for pity, I say it because I know that you CAN learn to love yourself.
  
 

  I realized that the reasons I wanted to kill myself, I couldn't find someone to be with, I wasn't happy with my weight, I was stuck in a loop of video games and sleep and work, were all things that I could either change or accept about myself. I determined I didn't want to die and I was tired of being who I was.
  
 

  The journey to find your true self starts with actually understanding what you do NOT want to be. I didn't want to be my father. I stopped drinking entirely and started evaluating my feelings about why I was so mad. This involved some hard truths. Nobody owed me anything. I didn't have friends because I didn't try to maintain relationships. I was fat because I couldn't moderate my intake (I'm still ""fat"" and have since learned that it's something I accept about myself, i'll get to that in a sec). I had no money because I didn't have skills, I was basically manual labor. Those were things I could change.
  
 

  I started practicing cognitive behavioral therapy, monitoring my thoughts when I found myself being angry, and I started writing down everything I thought. I made my thoughts real. I then argued with myself, on paper, about why things were happening and why I was ACTUALLY upset. I was mad all of the time because I was struggling financially and felt overwhelmed. I worked 2 40 hour a week jobs and still struggled so I researched careers.
  
 

  It took me 3 years to finally drag myself out of my gas station and warehouse jobs and get into... a call center... It was ass. I hated it, but it payed me more than 2 80 hour minimum wage gigs. I grinded for a year still practicing CBT, understanding that while it is okay to hate yourself (it happens to everyone) it is NOT okay to abuse yourself. I started talking to myself like I was a stranger while at the first call center. It was the best thing I've ever done. Self deprecation isn't funny when you hate yourself. It's not cute, it forces your insecurity on everyone else and makes them uncomfortable. I started writing down exclusively good things about myself. Fuck the bad. Everyone has bad. I MADE myself focus on the good. I have ADHD, I failed a LOT at not being negative, but I always circled back and wrote down good shit about myself even if brain wanted to die that day.
  
 

  I started sleeping more. I noticed that on REALLY bad days of depression, I could barely move. No showers, no laundry, just apathy. Every time I started to feel that black depression seep in, I used my anger that I had been taming against it. I started to fucking hate depression. You don't want me to get out of bed today? Fuck you. How about that. I deserve to be happy. Fuck you depression. I got in the shower... then I went back to sleep. I won. I took a shower. I achieved a goal.
  
 

  Those small wins added up. I started to get the confidence I needed to explore things I wanted to do, if I hated it I didn't do it again. Nobody helped me through this shit outside of a few articles on cognitive behavioral therapy and my absolute hatred of depression.
  
 

  I met my wife when I started to love myself. I was okay being alone. I liked who I had become. Yes, I was depressed and angry often. I couldn't change those things. I still get depressed. What I could change was how I fight those things. When I'm anxious, I take a shower because that's self love. When I'm depressed, I turn on old school iron chef because I love cooking and Japanese. I deserve to be happy. Fuck depression. Fuck anxiety. They will always be with you, but it's about how you take your next step.
  
 

  Understand that you are worthy of love. Your future partner is also worthy of love. But you have to realize that nobody is going to fix you. You have to work towards being a better person so that when you do meet someone you're interested in, you deserve them and they deserve you. You will always have to work on yourself, but in my opinion, nobody will ever be able to truly do anything for you until you're so fucking angry about being depressed and lonely that you get up and do something about it yourself. Be that change. You deserve to be happy.
  
 

  
 

  Edit: TL;DR When everything is shit and you can barely move because depression and anxiety are kicking your ass, make a tiny goal. My goal that day was to not kill myself. Yours could be to turn over in bed or just open the window a bit while you cry. It could be as simple as drinking a glass of water. Those tiny wins were enough to change my life."
"Hi Everyone
  
 

  Im a 40F looking for some help.Located in Ontario Canada.
  
 

  When the last job I worked for closed. Then I opened a home business which sank during COVID. 
  
 

  Im thinking for appling to big box stores ect. I feel like they would be the ones needing help on weekends. I have transportation to get to and from work on weekend 
  
 

  How do I apply online or in person?
  What do I use for references? I didn't keep in contact with anyone
  
 

  *Is there any other subs that maybe more value for this? Feeling overwhelmed and my family needs me to help with expenses*"
"I don't know what's wrong with me but I just don't seem to be able to see through people's bullshit and it's really starting to get me down. I find it's especially bad with women. I'm 36 and I've been used by 3 different women in the past couple of years because I just couldn't see what they were doing. It's so frustrating when all I'm trying to do is be a good person but people just seem to use people like that. I've tried ""toughening up"" so to speak but that just isn't me as a person and I find it really sad that people have to change who they are because of other people. 
  
 

  I can't tell if this is down to my anxiety, a personality flaw or something else (currently being tested for ADHD/Autism). 
  
 

  Does anyone else get this or am I just an idiot?"
"Holy fuck I'm wired. 
  Been wired for hours.
  Just don't!
  
 

  Short story was I have drank energy drinks for years but just started my meds last week.  
  
 

  Did pretty good staying off the caffeine while on meds, with the occasional Mt dew.  
  
 

  Today I wasn't thinking and drank a Bang!
  
 

  Just don't make my mistake!"
Just had my first CBT session today as I'm fed up with living with social anxiety and missing out on so much life.
"I am now 36 years old and over the years I got more and more the feeling that life can end any minute now. I feel the breath of death in my neck. I pretty much have at least some thoughts about death every day. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely don't want to die. It is horrifying to me, especially dying itself. Not being gone per se.
  
 

  I've had some weird episodes of ectopic heart beats in the past, but according to the doc there is nothing wrong with my heart. Besides that, there is actually nothing really wrong with me or my body. There is no reason to believe I might get cancer or a heart attack now or in the near future, but the worry is always there.
  
 

  And since I have a family (2 young daughters) this now also extends to my wife and kids. I'm scared of them ever dieing, but the worst part is that I know they will. Same goes for my parents, whom I love very much and are now in their late 60's, both not in the best of health.
  
 

  I feel like death will make it's entrance in my life soon. My parents will die. Some bad luck might happen to me or my family. Illnesses, accidents, you name it. I see the danger in everything, from flying in an airplane to exercising too hard. Everything is a potential cause of death.
  
 

  But even if that all doesn't happen, and we all miraciously happen to live in perfect health till age 85 and die peacefully in our sleep (which I don't believe is possible but ok), then still, even that feels terrifying. Life is going by too fast. The last 10 years were over in a blink and it won't be long, at least that how it feels right now, until I will be 70 years old and really have a reason to be anxious about death...
  
 

  I sometimes can't sleep at night with a feeling of pure dread. That my heart can stop beating at any minute now. And then I will be, quite slowly and afraid, be pulled into blackness. I try to rationalize it, but the feeling is there and doesn't go away until I sleep.
  
 

  Luckily, I don't feel like that all time. But still, everyday there is some notion of death in my head. Some thought that life is going by too quickly and that one day it will all end.
  
 

  And I'm just 36 goddamnit. These thoughts and feelings shouldn't be here yet. Even though I'm not the youngest anymore, with some avoidance of bad luck, I should have 25-30 years at least without much worries and watch my children grow up and enjoy life.
  
 

  I've been living a reasonably healthy lifestyle for about a year now. I'm rationalizing. Trying to think straight. But the feeling is often there.
  
 

  Today I was comforting my little daughter and I told her that 'everything will be okay'. But in my head I thought 'for a while at least, until you will get old, sick and die like everyone else'. What a terrible thing to have in the back of my mind all the time. Even though I know how long it might take before she gets old, it feels short at the same time...
  
 

  Basically, this is a form of death anxiety and I'm pretty done with it. 
  
 

  Anyone else recognizes something in here? What has helped for you? Thanks for listening."
"Hello!
  
 

  I have them how to deal with them? I don't have anxiety before my sleep. Those attacks are not every night but maybe 2-3 times per week. Today again I waked up at 3AM My heart was yet again racing so fast that my eyes couldn't see properly I was out of breath and I started to scream to my gf that I am dying help me etc I was pure terror luckely took only 30-45 seconds and then I was calm and got back to sleep."
I'm 38 with years of failure behind me (due to a combo of laziness and anxiety). Want to fix my mistakes but not sure how. I feel broken honestly. I am currently working full time but I'm not making much money and have been stuck in the same position for almost four years.
"So whenever I'm making a call, I have to be private. I don't want someone around me to listen when I'm talking on the phone. This makes it where I can't pick up phones at my job (always finding a way to escape) and even when I'm with friends or family, I walk away hidden in a room or in my car.  
  
 

  Also, I notice when I talk to someone over the phone, I have more confidence in pulling different topics than when I talk to them in person where I just blank out.
  
 

  What's wrong with me? I am not that great at making great long conversations and makes my dating suffer. I can do great on first dates, but it crumbles after."
"TW: ideation  
  I know most posters here are anxiety sufferers, but I don't have a lot of places to seek advice, so...
  
 

  My spouse (35M) has had anxiety his entire life. He has been on therapy much of his life and he started meds about the time we started dating in 2007 but the last 5 years his anxiety has gotten severely worse. He was hospitalized for 5 days late last year after he told me he was thinking about killing himself to get away from the anxiety. They put him on all new medications there and they don't seem to have helped much. He still has serious panic episodes that last hours, even days, where he waffles between being catatonic (laying in bed, trying to sleep the anxiety away) and being hysterical (screaming, crying, writhing, rocking back and forth, throwing up).
  
 

  I no longer feel like I'm married, I feel like I'm a full-time care giver. But I have my own chronic illnesses, and there's a lot of things I can't do on my own. He used to be the one to pick up my slack. He's our only income, but he's been cutting out of work to come home and have panic attacks. I can tell that I've lost my patience and I'm incredibly frustrated that I just have way more on my plate than I asked for and I can't handle it. I feel even worse because I know I should be more understanding having been through my own deep struggles with MDD, ideation, and social anxiety, but I've come out the other side and am in remission, and I think that's making it harder for me to empathize with him. 
  
 

  I still love him, and I don't plan on going anywhere, but I don't know how to (1) keep my own mental health through this and (2) how to help him, or accept that I can't."

"I often get 'weird' vision in situations with 'harsh' or uneven lighting. Fluorescent lamps seem to do the trick, especially when mixed with daylight. And especially when the daylight is very contrasty like when it's about to get dark or rain. It can also happen when it's dark in a room and I'm looking at someone with a bright building behind them or something. You get the idea.
  
 

  It's pretty weird but I'll try to describe it. It's almost like 'frames' are missing from my visual feed. Like a video that's being played back at 20 fps in stead of 30. Like there is a slight 'delay' between the visual info and the processing of my brain. I feel 'spaced out' and naturally anxiety often comes up. The situation becomes 'unreal' because of how my eyes and brain interpret the situation.
  
 

  Often this goes away as soon as I leave the situation / go outside or whatever. Sometimes I also have it at home, mostly when I'm tired or have a flu or cold virus. When I cough or blow my nose a couple of times, it is also present shortly. Like the pressure behind my eyes causes it.
  
 

  I've had my eyes checked before. Nothing wrong with them, almost perfect vision. I've had migraine headaches when I was in puberty but that was only for 2 years and have been attack free ever since (20 years ago). So that's not it either.
  
 

  I believe it must have something to do with a 'tense' state due to anxiety in combination with 'analyzing' the world in detail and overconcentrating on inner processing or so. It seems similar to 'dereliazation' but because certain lighting circumstances seem to trigger it, I don't know if that's it. 
  
 

  Who else recognizes this?"
My girlfriend got COVID and I can COVID from her. We live together. I am so anxious now. She don't have symptoms only sore throat. But my anxiety is now 100% off the charts. How to calm down? My health anxiety is so bad. I am afraid of severe disease...
"DAE get triggered by music? It seems like all music is about relationships. I'm 35 and have never had a relationship. It just triggers me. Even sad songs are about relationships. But I don't want to listen to the same depressing indie music that I used to listen to... I just don't think I'll ever have what other people have. I have a lot of mental health issues, am a recovering junkie and have been on disability for most of my adult life..."
"Was on Celexa (citalopram) for a few years. The past few weeks have been quite challenging. I really liked it but it was starting to not be effective. Over ten years of taking antidepressants I think this is my 6 or 7th different medication. It's like my body becomes acclimated over a few years and they become less effective. Here's to hoping to have very mild if any startup side effects! Btw, I still have celexa in my system."
"So like the title says my(34F) boyfriend(32) started his new job yesterday and my anxiety is through the roof. Yesterday wasn't so bad because he was only gone for a few hours for orientation. Buy today he started training and unlike his last job he really can't text me as much. 
  
 

  I know I'm an adult and shouldn't have to be in constant contact with him. And this is not a trust thing, this is a combination of I'm terrified of something happening to him and the fact he is literally the only person in my life right now I can count on. I have no one else. He is everything to me. I am in therapy working on getting through all this but it's not like this happens over night. 
  
 

  And to make matters worse I am currently on zero anti-anxiety meds but I can't find a damn Psychiatrist. The Psychiatrist who was prescribing me my meds was fired from the clinic and they didn't have a replacement. My primary refused to bridge my meds until I can find a new Psychiatrist. So not only did have have to get off my meds cold turkey. Trust me I know I dangerous that is. I have been having almost daily anxiety attacks because I can't get in with a doctor to prescribe me my meds. 
  
 

  I have a heart condition that is largely impacted by stress, i.e. stress, where is my heart rate jumps up to high my blood pressure drops and I pass out. I have called at least 20 Psychiatrists and I have had zero luck getting in with one. It is beyond frustrating.

"Well, since this morning my temperature is kind of raising slowly and don't have any other symptoms. 
  
 

  I had my 2nd moderna dose in may 2021. 
  
 

  I'm not sure how well its gonna protect my body now and I'm not even sure if it's covid, depending on my 99.8 temperature now I'm thinking I have covid. And loosing my mind over it. 
  
 

  Started isolation since this after noon and I hope I didn't infect my wife."
"Ever since I returned to my country (Perú) after living in the US for fifteen years, my sister who is two years younger than I am makes my life a living hell. We both live at home even though we are almost 40 (I'm 39 and she'll turn 38 this year). I live at home because upon returning from the US, teaching English has been the only job I've been able to land so far and the most I get paid here in Peru is 300 dollars a month. My father was diagnosticated with Alzheimer's back in 2018 and it's been an emotional rollercoaster ever since. However I returned in 2015 and my sister has been like that since then. I made the huge mistake of returning to college in Peru which is five years (as opposed to four years in the US) and because of my US credits were not accepted here, I had to start pretty much from the beginning. None of the skills I've learnt in the US such as customer service or interpersonal/ communication skills can be applied here. This is a completely different country and economy. The only way someone can make a decent living is by working on a desk job more than fifty hours a week. I worked my whole life in the US in retail and merchandising, I don't know anything about office related stuff, on top of that I've been told that due to being ''to old'' and a male, no one would hire me as a clerk. My only hope is to keep teaching English until I can find something useful to to with my communication degree. Thank you all for reading."
"People don't understand that their interruption to try to get me to do ""one little thing"" for them right now really screws with my process and how are it is to get back into the groove again. 
  
 

  After the interruption I tend jump through several side tracks before getting on the project I was working on before, if I even get back there at all today.
  
 

  If ignore them they tend to loop in my boss, their boss, and sometimes our director which just makes me want to tell them to fuck off.
  
 

  So now I am on Reddit venting instead of getting back to what I was doing.
  
 

  Positive note I finally have an appointment with a professional to help get my ADHD managed, I hope."

"Hi, I'm just looking for some support on anxiety/childhood trauma/attachment issues. and yes I'm in therapy. I'm 37 years old female and growing up my father when he was alive didn't really accept me because of my ADHD. There were often times he physically abused me. On top of this in school I was bullied. I had a friend who would be my friend one day and then the next day not be my friend. This childhood trauma has effected my friendships in the adult world where if someone accepts me and my issues I tend to latch onto them. I have ADHD, Anxiety, and OCD that goes along with it. The OCD and the attachment problems go together.
  
 

  I'm a gamer and recently made a new friend who my age. She is a girl that is so much like me and she understands me. I have gotten attached to her I can feel it. We play GTA FiveM together and I always want to be with her when she is on her character Beth. We talk to each other everyday on Discord &amp; I try to get her to go into voice with me but she prefers not to be as she is staff in the GTA Roleplay Server &amp; doesn't want to be accused of rule breaking since sometimes when she is in voice with people it will come through her mic into the server.
  
 

  I have noticed I get anxiety when we don't talk, and I'm trying to do things on my own to space between us even though things are fine with us. I'm just trying to fix this attachment thing with her. She understands me and she doesn't have an issue.
  
 

  At 37 I don't have life experience that others do, I never really explored my sexuality and I feel like this girl has me questioning everything &amp; that maybe I caught feelings for her. She was going through something and that's how we became close because I helped her through it as we are similar so much. She is coming out of a break up but she did ask me about sexuality and told me she is pansexual. She would make comments how I'd end up with a GF and it was funny. She said that's why she asked me about sexuality as she wasn't sure how I felt about it. Ever since my head has been spinning and I feel like I really do like her.
  
 

  I talked to my therapist about this and she thinks it's obsessive feelings making me confused due to the attachment issues I have. I was wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation who can help give some guidance here. I feel so down on myself and embarrassed of how I am. I hate it that I have these issues and that my brain is like this.
  
 

  But this new friend she is so understanding and she doesn't judge me at all for it. However as you know with anxiety it's hard to not constantly worried does she not want to hang out with me etc."
"I am a 35m who has dealt with anxiety most of my life. In school, I was always shy and very nervous about things like public speaking and large groups but it was always manageable with no real issues. When I reached around 18 years old, I started suffering from depression so I was prescribed Citalopram. Over the next few years, I would see a couple different counselors in regards to the depression and anxiety with the public. Eventually I stopped the counseling completely as it was not really helping and in doing so also stopped the Citalopram and things were fine for years. I still had anxiety, of course, but it was completely manageable and did not affect my life too much.
  
 

  Then in 2016, I went through one of the worst years of my life. Earlier in the year, I had fainted at work, which was the first time I have ever blacked out like that. The hospital said it was from dehydration but I was talking to a girl seriously for the first time in a long time at the time too so I imagine the anxiety that came with the issues from that helped in the matter as well. At the time, I was also on a medication to try to help me lose weight but I was not eating right or exercising so the medication probably played a part as well since I was not living correctly to coincide with it. At that point, my doctor took me off that medication.
  
 

  Then later that year I took a week vacation around my 30th birthday and suffered several panic attacks and several ER visits that week. The anxiety I felt that week was the worse feeling I've ever had in my life and promised myself I would do whatever I had to in order to never feel that way again. A number of things was happening to me at the time and they all could have aided in the panic attacks - once again I was seriously talking to another new girl, my best friend’s father was having issues with nose bleeds in and out of the hospital and they couldn't figure out what was wrong, another best friend was dealing with diverticulitis that had him in the hospital, my 30th birthday was quickly approaching and I generally hate people making a big deal out of me or things like my birthday and lastly I was going to the Rhode Island Comic Con. Though thinking about those things never really triggered any type of anxiety per say I imagine the combination of them all in the span of a week or so just built up. There was also an incident around this time where I nearly fainted in an IMAX movie theater. The film was Doctor Strange, so somewhat ‘trippy’ and I had not eaten beforehand though I did smoke marijuana and have a beer. So I imagine my blood sugar may have been low or something like that. I remember the feeling of having some indigestion in the theater and when I tried to burp a few times, it did not really help and instantly made me light-headed. I stumbled out of the theater and ended up sitting on the lobby floor for a little while before getting something to eat. It is this type of anxiety I am still dealing with today though I could not for the life of me pinpoint the reason.
  
 

  Thankfully, I was able to get in to see a psychiatrist at the end of that hellacious week and just speaking to her and being prescribed medication to help calmed me down to the point I was not getting so anxious I would have attacks. At first, my primary had tried putting me on Citalopram again but that was not helping so they switched me to Paxil. At the same time the psychiatrist put me on Propranolol, both the daily extended release version and the weaker ""as needed"" one for when I was feeling especially anxious. I could not tell you if it was the Paxil or the Propranolol that helped more as I was placed on both at the same time but they did indeed help and I was fine again for years. I also spoke to another counselor at this time but after just a few sessions, we both decided I did not really have much to talk to a counselor about so my visits were essentially a waste. To this day, I am still seeing that same psychiatrist, though since COVID started it has been short tele-communication calls and she doesn't help me much aside from prescribing me my medication.
  
 

  Now that we are all up to date, last year I started feeling tremendous anxiety once again. Earlier in 2021, my 4.5-year relationship ended but I honestly do not believe that caused my heightened anxiety as I was fine at the time and it was an amicable split that was best for both of us. As the year went on though my anxiety started creeping up more and more, especially in the mornings. I would wake up in the morning and toss and turn for an hour or so before I had to get ready for work and feel very anxious the whole time. Upon speaking with my psychiatrist and primary about it my primary decided to take me off the Paxil as apparently after a while that could have a reverse effect on anxiety and he put me on 20mg of Fluoxetine. He also said anxiety could be a side effect of diabetes so they tested me for that since it is very prominent on both sides of my family. Turns out, I have Type 2 Diabetes. Now I had been tested in the past and was fine, even though I would have “weakened” bouts of low blood sugar at times. Now before I was diagnosed I was an idiot and for about a month, I pounded sugary drinks like Brisk Tea and Mountain Dew like it was going out of style. I have no doubts that idiotic decision to gorge myself on those drinks is what caused my numbers to be so high, triggering my diagnosis. So I was placed on 500mg Metformin and Glipizide for the diabetes. For those following along this now puts me at Metformin, Glipizde, Propananol, Fluxoetine and a 1-a-Day Vitamin that I am taking daily.
  
 

  I started feeling a bit better for a few weeks, though still with underlying anxiety, until the beginning of December. At that point I suffered a couple days of tremendous anxiety (though no panic attacks, Thank God) and it turns out I had the Norovirus stomach virus. This really knocked me on my ass for a couple weeks to the point I barely got out of bed and ate nothing but toast and chicken soup. This was also causing my anxiety to skyrocket so my primary upped my Fluoxetine to 40mg daily. He also prescribed me Atorvastatin for my high cholesterol since my latest labs showed a very high lipid panel, which has been high for years now anyway. He also prescribed me Buspirone 10mg to take as needed when I feel an anxiety attack coming. I suppose this is different than my “as needed” Propranolol since that is more of a beta-blocker used for high heart rates and the Buspirone is strictly for anxiety.
  
 

  I started feeling a lot better after this; though the anxiety was still there, it was manageable, until yesterday. Two nights ago I fell asleep around 730pm and woke up at 130am with tremendous anxiety. It kept me up the rest of the night and was absolutely awful. I tried taking a Buspirone and I believe I might have fell back asleep for an hour but it did not really help otherwise as the anxiety stood throughout the whole day at work. Last night I fell asleep early again, around 830pm and woke up again around 2am. Again, my anxiety was off the charts but I was able to fall back asleep, though I ended up waking up every hour after that and am still feeling very anxious this morning as I type this. The past two days with this heightened anxiety I've also been dealing with nausea and stomach issues again like I did at the start of the Norovirus. I did test for COVID and it was negative and I suppose it could be the Norovirus again though I'm thinking it's more just my anxiety causing my current stomach issues since the vomiting isn't as prominent as it was a few weeks ago and although nauseous, I can still keep food down.
  
 

  So this is where I'm at now. I have a telehealth appointment with my psychiatrist on Monday where I will update her on how I've been the past couple months but I've also recently discovered these Reddit pages and noticed how helpful people can be on here so I figured it was worth a shot. Surely someone must be dealing with similar anxiety issues as me and have corrected them?
  
 

  Now just a bit more background on me. I very rarely drink any sort of alcohol aside from a couple of beers on the rare occasion I’m being social with friends, though I am an avid cannabis user, smoking daily (though never before or during work hours). I am sure it has helped my anxiety in the past but it is not the reason I smoke. I have just always really enjoyed smoking and the feelings that come along with it. I am a believer in it makes everything more enjoyable. Though when I came down with the Norovirus I stopped smoking because when my anxiety is ramped up high like that smoking tends to heighten it and make it worse. (Where-as other times when the anxiety is present but not as amped up the cannabis helps - it is a vicious circle). Since I have recovered, I have started smoking again though I am easing back into it and so far it does usually help rather than hinder.
  
 

  As for my life, I honestly do not believe I have much to be anxious about. Sure I have a mortgage and things like that but that type of stuff never really gave me direct anxiety. I have a handful of great friends I would not trade the world for, a close family that loves me very much and I love them, a nice car, a good job, a roof over my head… I live comfortably and really do not have any reason to feel this type of anxiety. I consider myself very lucky in that sense. Aside from my long-term relationship ending last year I was also promoted at work, which I suppose could aid to my heightened anxiety but if it has it is subconsciously as work has never seemed to directly give me anxiety like this. Since I work with the public and my 60+ year old father lives with me I am sure COVID has also played a part in my anxiety getting worse, much like the rest of the world.
  
 

  Aside from the medication, currently I am also trying to eat a lot better (because the diabetes and high cholesterol as well) as I know eating unhealthy can help cause anxiety problems. I have eaten unhealthy most of my life so I am sure that is a reason why I have always dealt with anxiety. I have also never been an exerciser and I know that is supposed to help a lot as well. With that being said, I am planning to start exercising regularly as well to help combat the anxiety, diabetes and high cholesterol. I am just finding it hard to kick-start as I have a treadmill in my garage but right now is so cold it is hard to get out there to exercise. I also have DDPYoga that I was enjoying a few years back but, and I know it's a stupid excuse, there is no good area in my home to do it as I'm tall and the ceiling fan is in the way in the living room for reaching my arms up and such. I know these are just excuses and it is one of the things I am really trying to work on so I can get an exercise schedule going as it is only going to help my numerous issues at this point.
  
 

  My first A1C numbers a few weeks ago were actually excellent and NON-DIABETIC, which has me kind of believing my initial diagnosis may have been a bit preemptive since I was pounding those sugary drinks for weeks prior going into that lab work. This line of thinking has also caused me to believe maybe it is the (not necessarily needed) diabetes medication (or new cholesterol medication?) that may be making my anxiety worse? With these improved numbers, my primary did take me off the Glipizide and if my numbers are still good in 3 months he's going to cut down my Metformin dosage in half.
  
 

  I have tried so many things to try to combat this anxiety. Things like breathing exercises and different lines of thought as well as things like meditation and soothing music from apps like ""Calm."" While these things do tend to ""help"", when I'm already feeling a certain level of anxiety it's tremendously hard for me to try any of these helpful tools and succeed because the anxiety just keeps creeping in, causing these tools to seem pointless, and most often don't help at all. It does get better if I am able to occupy my mind on something else usually but most of the time when I am in an anxious state trying to concentrate on something else just isn’t in the cards.
  
 

  With a gun to my head, I could not give you a reason for this anxiety I've been feeling... The best way for me to describe it is a constant underlying sense of unease with a heavy feeling on my chest usually. Like I am on edge and any moment could fall over the edge. Lately it has been a pretty constant nauseous feeling as well where I feel like vomiting though most of the time my stomach is completely empty. For the most part it's been manageable enough where I'm not having ""attacks"" and can work and such, thankfully, but it has drastically affected my quality of living over the past few months and I'm so, so tired of it. To the point where I can actually understand why people would commit suicide to get away from this constant uneasiness. I do not believe I would ever consider something as drastic as I love life too much and fear death, but it's definitely thoughts that have crossed my mind while feeling this way lately.
  
 

  My apologies for the long-winded post and my undying thanks to anyone who reads my message and may end up replying. I am just at my wits end and am desperate to find any way possible to improve this anxiety. Right now I just continue telling myself to get up and work through it though the feeling just doesn’t seem to want to go away."
"I (38M) have a thin official history with ADHD but mostly have just isolated and self-managing the best I can. However, I can't do it anymore and I am very new to asking for help here. 
  
 

  What should I be doing and who should I be talking to make sure I get the help I need?
  
 

  A little history:
  
 

  Put on ADHD meds 8 years ago but under a year and I moved out of state and never got a new doctor. Just after this, my Mom let me know then that I was also diagnosed as a child but she refused treatment
  
 

  I need to get this under control. Any help or direction is much appreciated. Thank you."
"I have times where I am trying to get through a task but it's like I am trying to push my mind through tar. I know what I need to do and how to get it done but it takes what what feels like a lot longer to get through it and sometimes I just stop because mental fatigue sets in.
  
 

  Is this my ADHD?
  
 

  Thanks, just trying to pin point all the things I deal with and wondering if its the ADHD.
  
 

  Edit: I am not getting distracted either though I deal with that often and know that is ADHD."
"I found out in my early adult life I was actually diagnosed with ADHD as a child but my parents refused treatment. 
  
 

  Well now well into adult life I have been trying to get my ADHD under control and in doing so been researching it more and I suddenly realized something.
  
 

  Growing up I would often get into arguments with my parent because they'd get after me for things they asked of me but I had no recollection of the requests. The more it happened more both of us got frustrated.  
  
 

  I swore at the time my parents were just crazy but now I am starting to think it was my ADHD.
  
 

  Anyways just wanted to share."
"Hello,
  
 

  I got COVID two weeks ago I am double vaxxed and had symptoms for a 3 days. One night little bit fewer and runny stuffed nose. Very mild symptoms. But now I see on Twitter messages that people dying after COVID later from heart attacks strokes and etc. Your chances to die after infection are higher and etc I just Google for it and digging the Twitter checking hashtags like omicron death hearth attack etc. I can't sleep now I am constantly afraid that I will get stroke or anything else. How to stop this behavior? My anxiety is off the charts. I am so afraid."
"Been looking at all the hobbies, projects, and routines I have attempted over the years. I think the longest was 6 months before I wake up one day and it suddenly off to something else. 
  
 

  I eventually cycle back to them, usually the following year. 
  
 

  I would have thought 6 months of routine would be a good foundation for a habit but I guess not."
"I don't consume sugar often but I got a real bad craving for donuts last Friday and ended buying a case and eating several through the weekend.
  
 

  Yesterday, back at work, and I my focus and ability to remember simple tasks or think was just shot. Things I did daily I couldn't do yesterday to save my life. It was really frustrating.
  
 

  Realizing that it may have been the sugar, I decided to opt-out of donuts today and I am almost back to my normal level. 
  
 

  Is this ADHD+suguar is bad or is this just me having bad reactions to sugar (after all its not healthy for anyone period).
  
 

  FYI - I am not on meds for my ADHD yet, have my first dr. appt next week to explore treatment options."
"Hi everyone, I'm new here. Not sure what to expect from this community, but definitely looking forward to seeing resources and shared experiences.
  
 

  A little about me, I'm 35 and I've always been a ""busy"" person. Not like a workaholic, but just fidgety/energetic/impulsive. In December 2019, I had a panic attack at work. Completely out of the blue and nothing particularly stressful was happening in that moment. But a lot of stressors in my life, work and otherwise, just piled up and boiled over in that moment. I've always considered going to therapy as an adult, but I always put it off because I felt like I had my life and emotions under control, but also because my parents had a nasty divorce when I was a kid and my brothers and I were dragged to half a dozen different court-appointed therapists and mediators (both parents used my brothers and me as pawns to fight with each other. One of them would accuse the other of something, they'd do the he-said-she-said, then I'd get dragged to therapists I didn't want to see in order to sort of whatever petty BS they were going through). So that experience kept me away from doing therapy myself, even though I work in the mental health field and am a big advocate for therapy.
  
 

  The panic attack was kind of a wake up call, I took a few days off work in order to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist and to find a therapist. That whole process of even finding a therapist in the first place is HARD. But I was soon diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and ADHD. I always had a sense something was different about how my brain worked, and I've always had a tough tie with procrastinating, staying focused on a task for long, and being impulsive. That would impact the quality of my studies/homework/job, I'd push up against deadlines, which would make me anxious, I'd cope with it by making myself ""busier"" but not doing anything of substance, it would delay what I ACTUALLY needed to do more, I'd get more anxiety about it, aaaaaaaand repeat.
  
 

  Anyway, I've been in therapy and a low-dose SSRI ever since, and I think it's a good thing too since COVID happened just a month after I started therapy.
  
 

  Anyway, sorry to rant, but glad I found this community and that there are other people out there who might have these same experience as me and can empathize and find some tools to work with my anxiety and ADHD.
  
 

  Thanks for reading!"
Day by day account (when I don’t forget) on my experience starting on Escitalopram/Lexapro.
"This is my first time posting here. I'm 38 and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder in the past but I'm not currently seeing a therapist. I am on Buspirone but I feel like it has been pretty ineffective. I do have pretty consistent anxious thoughts and feelings, but I mostly feel it in my body. Sometimes I think if I could just disrupt the physical cycle of anxiety, I could sort of reset. Does that make sense?  
  My muscles are constantly tense. My heart rate goes through many fluctuations throughout the day. I am often clenching my jaw or picking at my fingers. Breathing exercises and mantras can help, but it seems to be very temporary, as in it only helps when I'm actively doing the exercise.  
  There are external stressors that trigger my anxiety, like the instability of my husband's job (not his fault) or living paycheck to paycheck. But I also find myself having intrusive thoughts about my family dying or losing my job and becoming homeless. Things that are very from possible, but just possible enough that they keep me up at night.  
  How can I get into a better routine of coping mechanisms. I seem to have this unconscious idea that if one thing doesn't just fix it all, it's not even worth doing. Do you all have any routines that work for you, or things to help relieve the physical anxiety. I have thought about pot but it's not legal in my state and the last time I tried it in my 20s it made me really paranoid."
"Hello, I hope this is in the right place. I am sorry, I am new to Reddit in my desperate search for something to help me with a problem.
  
 

  I am 39. So about 3 months ago, I began having **24/7 breathlessness** (at rest too, all the time) one night out of nowhere, with no other symptoms other than feeling like my chest is congested with mucus, but not much comes up. To me, it **feels like I can inhale fine, but the difficulty is that I feel like my exhale isn't long enough**, like I run out of air to exhale before it has been long enough, if that makes sense. To make a long story short, I have been told this may be about 7 different things by 7 diff doctors. My doctor says this is NOT COPD and that COPD does ""not present this way"". I **smoked cigarettes for about ten to 15 years up until about 5 years ago and vaped from about 5 years ago until December 2021 when I quit cold turkey**. Up until a few months ago, I was quite active, going for walks/jogs every day of at least 2km with no problems. I went from active and productive to an absolutely useless, fatigued, breathless vegetable overnight. I was first told it was **asthma**, but the Ventolin and the Flovent don't help. I was told it could be **COPD** by another doctor, but as I said, my doctor is convinced it's not that. Another doctor thought it may be **reflux**, and she gave me **Pantaloc**, to double dose for a week and then once a day. It didn't help at all. I have had two chest x rays, but which were clear. I had a CT scan that said **everything was unremarkable except for a ""mildly prominent right hilar lymph node measuring 9mm. Otherwise, no significant lymph enlargement size criteria.** Of course, once again, my doctor says not to worry about this, I had pulmonary function tests a few days ago, and I do not have a final report yet, all I could see was this on the screen
  
 

  **FVC 3.62**
  
 

  **FEV1 2.97**
  
 

  **FEV1/FVC 83**
  
 

  **FEF25-75% 3.17**
  
 

  **PEF 7.01**
  
 

  My doctor tells me that this is anxiety and has put me on Escitalopram, which I started 4 days ago. I quit taking the Ativan that I was given by another doctor after taking it for a month, by tapering from 1mg, to 05, to 0.25 to none about a week ago. I have been trying to follow some Buteyko breathing stuff on Youtube and reading books on breathing.
  
 

  Has anyone else been through something like this?
  
 

  I appreciate any responses :) Thank you!

"My (35f) health anxiety is spiraling out of control. I know it’s common to confuse panic attacks with heart attacks. I’ve been to the ER twice for this reason, the last one was this time last year. But I actually don’t have extreme physical anxiety attacks that often. 
  
 

  I had a panic attack Friday (or so I think). I had smoked marijuana (it’s legal recreationally where I live). Shortly after I had some chest discomfort, started to panic, which led to other symptoms like feeling flushed and a tingly sensation in my left arm. 
  
 

  Rather than go to the ER I talked myself down and walked around for a few minutes and it all quickly went away for the most part. I took a Xanax later that day and got extremely tired. I didn’t go to the ER because for the last year I have convinced myself I have appendicitis, blood clots, you name it, when I felt the slightest discomfort or pain. 
  
 

  I feel technically fine right now minus the extreme worry I cannot shake. I stupidly looked up all this stuff about silent heart attacks and how marijuana is bad for your heart. And I have had chest discomfort (feels like indigestion) on and off for a couple months. 
  
 

  So basically I was successful in calming myself down in the moment, just to be panicking after that I made the wrong decision. 
  
 

  I am making an appt with my doctor this week, to check out my heart and talk about my worsening anxiety. I’m assuming she will tell me it’s all good. My bf and family say I’m probably just fine. But I cannot shake this feeling that I really did have one and should have gone. I can’t concentrate and it’s all I can think about. 
  
 

  I am going to get checked out so I know this feeling won’t last forever. But assuming the tests will be normal like usual, how can I cope with feeling confident in my decision that I don’t need to visit the ER each time this happens?"
Has this happened to anyone ? Any tricks for it ? I’m so down on what to do .. I am 38 F 115 pounds . Thank you
"I have know about this event for about 5 years now. My father is 50 now, and he told me about this a random day. He was very young when the psychic told him this, and I remember him saying ""I'm 40 now, so I don't really know what the definition of young is"". I asked him whether it stressed him out and he told me he just likes to live life to the fullest no matter what. The thing is that I live abroad so I can't spend time with him, and suddenly the thought of him dying soon entered my head out of nowhere. I haven't worried about this in a while, but now it won't leave my head, so now I'm thinking that it's likely it will happen because this thought has not bothered me in years, and that maybe I have some psychic abilities and that's why this thought popped up in my head now. I'm scared. Anyone have stories of people who went to psychics who told them they would die and didn't?"
"I'm just absolutely devastated, my anxiety is going off, and I'm scrambling mentally to find something to do.
  
 

  My wife and I have had our dog for 4.5 years. Rescued him as a pup, and he was just absolutely the most amazing and wonderful dog. We couldn't wait to have a dog our entire relationship, and once we bought our home in 2017, that was one of the first things we did. We took great care of him, got him all his puppy training classes, and he he did so well. We house trained him, played with him, stimulated him, gave him boundaries and rules. He has never been super food oriented and just loves people. He'd get so excited when family and friends came home and just loved being in the room with everyone and having company.
  
 

  About 6 months in, however, we had a trauma. He and I were alone at the dog park one morning, and a lady came to the gates with a giant chocolate lab (my dog ain't small either. He's an Akbash, which is a livestock guard dog, and he was jut about 100lbs at the time). This lady had no control of her dog. It was pulling and yanking her on the leash, and she was trying to yank back and was still getting dragged by this thing. This dog had its eyes on us, was barking, drooling, and just absolutely pulling the owner. I yelled at her to not let that dog in the park, if not to get him calm first, then to at least give us some room so I could leave before she brought this thing in. Nope, she comes into the dog park anyway, lets the dog off the leash, it makes a b-line straight for us, and without hesitation bit my dog and grabbed him by the neck. I began kicking the dog, and luckily I got a good shot to its ribs and it let go. I ran my dog and I out of the dog park, while trying to keep the lab at bay, while the lady is YELLING at me for kicking her dog.
  
 

  Everything turned out okay and it luckily was not nearly as bad as it could have been in terms of phsyical danger and injury. He surprisingly had no physical injuries or anything like that, but he 100% was traumatized. And he changed after that.
  
 

  Since then, about 95% of the time, he's the chillest, sweetest dog with a really easy temperament. He goes to a great daycare where he safely plays with other dogs and LOVES going there, we still walk him all the time, play with him, give him stimulation, love and affection, but he's also just as happy being lazy and just hanging out with us watching TV. Still his favorite thing is just to be in the room lazing around with us.
  
 

  But he's been anxious and very reactive since then. Any of the slightest sounds of anyone coming near us or the house and he goes into protective mode. 0-100% almost instantaneously. Like he's a different dog altogether when he clicks into that mode. He's never bitten or physically attacked anyone, but he's very scary. Braking, growling, snarling, pulling. And once he's in that mode, pretty much nothing can snap him out of it.
  
 

  So for years now we've worked with several trainers to try to undo the damage. We've learned calming techniques, we've modified and manipulated our environment to make things less stressful, we've had a regiment of activities to build his trust with us and that we'll protect him. He's compliant with training, and knows his commands and his basic boundaries, but nothing has ever been able to prevent him from clicking into this protective mode, no matter how much we try to go slowly and positively reinforce the interaction, or try to diffuse the trigger from setting him into it. Sometimes even when we can successfully diffuse one trigger, a new one pops up unexpectedly, and it's been an almost never-ending cycle of identify the trigger, and desensitize towards it. But it's also always felt like chasing the symptom and treating it without getting to the root cause of it. We've tried different diets, CBD Oil, and even medication. And short of the anti-anxiety medication that completely dopes him up and makes him sleep, nothing has worked.
  
 

  So for a while now, we've just had to accept we have an anxious dog, and we're not going to try and force him to accept people in the home or intentionally put him in stressful situations. People come over, we just put him away in the other room with music on, and he's way more content with that than us trying to desensitize him.
  
 

  Last year, my wife and I had our first child. We worked for MONTHS with our trainer on how to best prepare him for the baby. And we were incredibly surprised and very pleased that by the time we brought our baby home, he was just as calm and gentle with her as he has always been with us. It's almost as if nothing changed, and he just knew she was part of our pack. He's always seemed to enjoy, and be calm with her company as much as he is with my wife and me.
  
 

  Our daughter just started crawling last month, and when she crawled over to him the first time, he rolled over onto his back and just let her pet him, touch him, and was totally chill and relaxed with that. When she got tired and laid down, they even laid next to each other and just hung out a bit.
  
 

  But that was the first and only time he was calm about it.
  
 

  Now that she's crawling more (everywhere, actually), his anxiety has been getting triggered. He's never tried to bite or attack her, but because she's a baby, she's unpredictable. She's on the floor with her toys, and the floor has always been his place, and now she's in that space. So several times he's barked at her, growled, tried to take her toys, etc. One thing my wife and I discussed when we were expecting is that we're willing to do a lot of training and work with him, but our daughter's safety is not something we're willing to mess with. Initially, we tried talking about ways we can try to desensitize and repair this, but each day that goes by, he's showing his uneasiness more and more. He's more stressed, we're more stressed, we're having to keep them separated when she's crawling on the ground (and that's the ONLY time, he's still 100% okay with her and not remotely triggered when she's contained in her play pen, high chair, being held by us, etc. He'l even come over to her, sniff her, and wanted us and her to pet him). But when she's on the ground and crawling and playing, it's a whole different ballgame, and it's now become a revolving cycle of anxiety, and it's not good for anybody.
  
 

  My wife and I talked last night and we all but concluded that it's time to re-home him. Neither of us said it out loud, and I don't think I'm even capable of saying it out loud right now because it's too emotionally difficult to think about and I'm absolutely devastated. I love this dog so much and I relate to him on so many levels, especially anxiety-wise. He has always been so loved and so wanted, and it's been hard over the years to see that anxiety keep popping up and feeling like there's nothing we can do about it, no matter how much we try and how much training we've done. He's been such a pain in the ass and so much work in so many ways, but it's 100% been a labor of love.
  
 

  And now I feel like we've failed him. And now I am in a spiral of anxiety and I can't get myself out of ""fix it"" mode. Have we REALLY tried everything? Are we correctly analyzing this? Do we need a different trainer? On and on and on. And the thought of re-homing him is the bigger anxiety-inducer to me now. How do we even go about that? How do we find the right person who can give him a good home? What if it doesn't work out there and the new owner gets rid of him? What if they can't find a good environment for him and he ends up at a shelter, or worse? What will happen to him without us? What will happen to me without him? Why is he not happy with us anymore? Is there something else I could have done? Are we REALLY sure it's time to rehome him?
  
 

  Sorry for the long post. I'm still just trying to process all this, and I can't get my brain off of the anxiety cycle. This is so much more difficult that I could have imagined."
"Hey all, 
  
 

  I've been on Lexapro for about 3 yrs now. For the past 3 days or so my blood pressure is kinda on the lower side. 
  
 

  Top number is always above 110, heart is normal, but my lower number most of the time it's in lower 60s and I did see lower number to be 55,57 a few times. I was feeling a little lightheaded as well. 
  
 

  It had been a while since I used mr Google, but today I used and I regret doing it. It said if lower number is below 60 it may be due to the fatty layer in the heart or something like that. Also got me thinking of its because if my cholesterol is high and it might have caused it . My wife consoled me that it could be due to cold/sinus and I didn't eat properly last couple of days. 
  
 

  May be I just finding reasons to get anxious. 
  
 

  I will see a doctor in few days if I still feel lightheaded."
"I have wasted at least 2 hours staring at the TV menu trying to figure out something to watch
  
 

  Stared at the wall thinking of all the things I could be doing.
  
 

  Put a single load of laundry in the wash then spent the last several hours thinking I should go put it in the dryer. Guess we'll see how that turns out.
  
 

  Tried to play Minecraft. Loaded the world, wondered in a circle for a couple of hours, and then shut it off.
  
 

  Read the same paragraph of a book a couple of times before tossing it aside.
  
 

  I did do some story planning, but tried to do some writing ... ended up just staring at the screen.
  
 

  Made a few notes on some coding projects ideas but god forbid I should code anything.
  
 

  It's only 10 am, and already feel the day is just going to be a waste.
  
 

  Don't know how much of this is my ADHD but I really hope my insurance approves my meds this week.  
  
 

  I am f'ing tired or this..."
"EDIT: putting this at the top as I now know I didn't articulate my quest properly. I know I have ADHD. What I don't know is if the ADHD is causing the burnout. I am hoping that by getting my ADHD addressed, that is will help with my burnout.  
  
 

  QUESTION: As anyone been in this boat before and how did it go?
  
 

  TL/DR: how do you tell the difference between burnout and ADHD and how do you deal? Not medicated yet as I'm waiting on insurance approvals. 
  
 

  I'm am guessing it is both especially after an extremely stressful week last week. 
  
 

  For years I have concluded that I am dealing with burnout but after diving into ADHD and officially being diagnosed last week I am now wondering.
  
 

  In short I am struggling today with the temptation to just quit my job. It feels like it's the nail in the coffin today.
  
 

  I have a strict policy to only work 40 hours.
  
 

  Two years ago (months before covid) I was able to shift to work from home (helped A LOT with stress).
  
 

  I do walk away from the computer a lot bit that's more the ADHD then anything.
  
 

  I also completely unplug from work on the weekends but this weekend just felt completely ineffective in the R and R department. 
  
 

  Something to bring up with my therapist this week I guess but I'm curious what others think?"
"Hi there. 
  
 

  I have been struggling with anxiety since primary school. I am 36 now. I have been struggling withmy throat the last year or so. I have been to 4 doctors and a ENT specialist who said that I basically have TMJ... Because of my illness anxiety, I started panicing when I did a CT scan for my nose etc... Now I have all these weird sensations etc. My throat feels tight, I struggle to get a full breath, I get these tingling sensations on my neck and under my ears and it activates my gag reflex almost... It is horrible!!! I have experienced this now and then when having a panic attack or when I am in an anxious situatiom for a few hours like driving. It's almost like spasms in my throat now and then. It usually passes, the last couple of weeks it just feels constant, so much that I have to spray my mouth with a numbing spray just so that I do not get that gag feeling in my throat. I have been streelssed so much and I wonder if anyone else has experienced this before? It might just be my tmj because I also get sporadic earaches on my left side. Any one have anything to share?"
"39M with two young kids. I've always seen myself as a pretty hardy guy, used to be an athlete and push my body to the limit, always had a good pain tolerance. However, what I'm dealing with now has taken me right to the edge. I don't know where to turn or what to do. I've had chronic chest pains for 4 years now (undiagnosed, but been given all clear by doctors, cardiac causes ruled out). That and family life with a toddler and a baby already made life tough. The killer blow last week was that the company I'm working for is closing down. As a start-up there is zero redundancy pay, just my notice period. I now have to find a new job over the summer. I'm fortunate to have built up a bit of a financial cushion over the course of my career, but I'm shitting myself cos I've never found it easy to get a job in the field I'm in. I always seem to fuck it up at the last hurdle. I now have to do battle with these demons again. And not sure if it's related or not, but my chest pains are another level atm, I'm exhausted all the time and I'm depressed as hell, esp if I think that the last two and half years may have been for nothing. My psychiatrist suggested Prozac a few months ago. Have tried Sertraline before but it didn't do anything for me. I'm terrified that none of the meds I try will help. My wife knows what I'm going through, but I try not to let on too much - don't want her worrying about me doing something stupid. Just needed to get this out in the open, I find it hard to tell my friends/family how badly I'm hurting...."
"Hi everyone.
  
 

  I've(M33) just started dating this girl(F37) and everything is going fine. We've gone on five dates, talked a lot and just done the normal dating stuff I guess. We are taking it really slow and the only physical we've done is hugs and hand holding.
  
 

  The only problem I'm seeing is that she has anxiety regarding new relationships. She has had some bad and traumatic relationships(not just romantic ones) in the past and since we've started dating she has a hard time sleeping and eating. She is also looking for red flags and reasons for us not to be together like she automatically expects things not to work out. I know that this has nothing to do with me personally but it's hard to see her having a hard time. She has told me that this should get better the more time we spent with each other and she feels more relaxed and safe. I should add that she has said that she believes she's mildly autistic but has not gotten an official diagnosis.
  
 

  Now I know that this is a lot more complicated than I'm explaining here and it might be hard to give advice from the information but I'm just wondering if there's anything I can do to help? I have of course asked her but she can't think of anything I could do and reminds me that this is something she has work on herself which yes, I agree with but I'm still connected since this is because of this new relationship. I'm not worried that this will be like this forever since she said that it will get better with time but maybe I can show support somehow that I'm not thinking of. We're already taking things slow and we make sure we are both always comfortable with everything. Communication between us is really good, the best I've ever had with someone I've just recently met. We do take days off where we don't contact each other at all, just to take a break and make sure that this is not going to fast. Otherwise we have been texting and/or meeting every day.
  
 

  I'm sorry if this was all over the place.
  Thank you."
"Speaking candidly from my alternate account. I hope this is the right place to ask this, but I was on Lexapro for years, and I didnt seem to have any problem reaching completion, but about 7 months ago I stopped taking lexapro (realizing I should be on anxiety medication and how bad the side effects were), and started taking buspirone 10 mg twice a day. I noticed I stopped having much interest, and chalked it up to the stress Ive been going through. I recently started seeing someone, and finally we hooked up, but I noticed it was very difficult for me to reach completion, even with the aid of a toy. In the past Ive been almost too quick, but I also think its just more difficult with a partner. Anyway, all that TMI to ask if there are ways around this, if maybe increasing my self stimulation might help, or is this just something I'll have to deal with while taking this medication? TIA for any personal stories, tips or tricks you may be able to share. I know this is highly personal.
  
 

  Thought you all might want an update: I quit taking the buspirone and even tho I still have anxiety, I actually feel like I had more anxiety on the meds, I couldnt sleep the entire time I was on them, and I also realized that I had quit dancing/enjoying music. I was happy to have that and my sexual feelings back. *results not typical^^tm"

  I definitely never had mental health issues; then in January of 2022 I got COVID, had really bad Stomach &amp; GI issues w/ my COVID infection went to the hospital overnight twice in the 2 weeks I had it.
  
 

  I recovered (or so I thought) and then in April of 2022 the Stomach &amp; GI issues came back w/ a vengeance (rapid COVID test negative though)
  
 

  It’s now August - I haven’t worked in 4 months, I lost 40 lbs because of my stomach issues.
  
 

  While I am doing better, I still don’t know if I’m 100% as it’s been very “roller-coaster” - I will think I’m doing better &amp; then I’ll be really naseaus &amp; can’t eat again - seemingly out of nowhere for a few days/a week &amp; then I’ll be kind of ok again - over &amp; over.
  
 

  It’s like I am living in a state of constant fear.
  I cry ALL THE TIME.
  I’m home alone all day until my spouse comes home from work (thank goodness we still have one income at least)
  And even then sometimes I can’t get out of my “funk” or stop crying; sometimes it makes me feel better to have someone around me, sometimes not.
  
 

  Sometimes I’ll feel like “panicky” in my thoughts &amp; it’s like an imaginary flutter in my chest - not my heart but like the middle of my chest. I’m thinking about if I’m ever going to be better; how am I going to work again, am I ever going to be able to be “normal” me again &amp; not worry about if/when I’ll be bedridden sick again.
  Most days I just bawl my eyes out crying alone, until my spouse comes home - sometimes the crying stops sometimes not.
  
 

  I want my life back; I loved my life - I had an amazing, spontaneous, adventurous, active life &amp; it’s been ripped away from me.
  I never had these emotions &amp; feelings before. I don’t know what they are or how to deal with them.
  
 

  Is this anxiety/depression?
  Do I need medical help for it? Like therapist? 
  
 

  I’m not sure what to do.
  
 

  I get exhausted mentally &amp; emotionally from the crying &amp; thoughts. So much so that all I can do is lay on the couch &amp; watch a TV show or something as I’m just “spent” feeling - even though I basically did nothing all day - nothing but cry &amp; pray &amp; wonder if this is my life now.
  
 

  I’ve never had anything even in the ballpark of this before mentally.
  
 

  I’m not looking for a medical diagnosis or anything here - I just don’t know if I should be getting professional help? Or if this isn’t what Anxiety/Depression is?
  Or what is going on with me??!!
  
 

  Any insight anyone has would be appreciated.
  
 

  Thanks!"
"(36F) I have a CT tomorrow to check for possible reasons for blood in my urine (sorry if that’s TMI). Could be nothing, could be cancer or anything in between. 
  
 

  Anyway, I will get the results in my online MyChart before my doctor, which means I will be left to interpret them myself and that really scares me, especially if there’s something worrisome or weird. 
  
 

  I sent my care team a message asking if the doctor will review and write notes on it explaining what things mean (my follow up isn’t for two week after the scan). I got a very rude response back that no, the doctor will not do that and no, there’s no discussion of results until the follow up appointment because doctors are too busy and it’s “physically impossible” for them to do so. They’ll reach out ahead of time if something is urgent. 
  
 

  I understand doctors are super busy. I don’t understand why patient communication isn’t important.
  
 

  This is causing me so much anxiety. Any help or advice on any of this? Or how to cope while waiting for my follow up?"
"My physical symptoms have become stronger recently and I do wonder sometimes if there isn't anything wrong with me, physically, that could cause the (worsening of) symptoms of anxiety.
  
 

  So I know that low testosterone could cause anxiety, so maybe I should get tested for that. Thyroid hormones could do so as well, so that should also be on the list. What else? Cortisol levels? Vitamin levels? Other things that could be checked via blood / urine / saliva to rule stuff out?"
"So, my PCP says I have anxiety &amp; I should get some therapy, I have NEVER had mental health issues ever before (40f) recently last 3 years I’ve had a lot happen… COVID &amp; all that came with that, lost career of 15 years, had a bad health scare of my spouse, had some BAD health problems of my own, I been on leave from my job since April of this year due to it.
  
 

  Physically, I have been given the all good but my mental state is like I’m stuck in this constant state of fear &amp; worry.
  
 

  I can’t shake it.
  
 

  My husbands medical plan covers an actual clinical psychologist but I can’t find any local that are taking new patients! There aren’t many I can find &amp; the ones I have aren’t taking new patients. As we’re on one income now, I can’t afford just a therapist as its not covered if it’s just a councillor or therapist, it has to be a registered clinical psychologist to be covered. So I’m left to self treat.
  
 

  Mostly it’s mornings that are the problem for me, I get hit with a ton of running thoughts full of worry &amp; fear about all sorts of things, my chest feels like I need to take a big intake of air to get a breath, it’s crazy. I cry all the time, home alone all day - I don’t even know why I’m crying half the time.
  
 

  I pry &amp; pray but I can’t stop the worry &amp; fear &amp; sadness.
  
 

  I’d like to try healing this w/o pharmaceuticals if I can.
  
 

  Can anyone recommend techniques or tips I can try?
  
 

  I need my life back, I miss the amazing life I had. I can’t function like this."
"So long story short. I contracted covid around New Years. Ended up in the ER from pushing myself with the snow removal one night (Chicago can suck it in the wintertime). Felt like a panic attack for all intents and purposes. Hyperventilation, elevated heart rate, cold sweat, extreme physical dread, etc. Sat on a bed in the hallway of the ER for an hour or two and finally felt pretty normal again. I figured I hadn't eaten enough that day + pushed myself too hard
  
 

  Fast forward to the beginning of February, I feel the same symptoms come on. I stay relatively calm and try to wait it out/eat food/drink water. Nothing. End up in the ER again. Same story feel better, go home. Except this time it keeps popping back up for the next five days until I'm finally admitted to the hospital for a day of monitoring/chest xrays/cardiac echoes and a stress test. All came back clear. Get prescribed xanax .5mg twice daily, I ask to bump it up to 1 when I noticed .5 wasn't cutting it.
  
 

  So here's my dilemma. I've been on 1mg of xanax daily for almost six months (occasionally taking an extra if I feel like the dread is starting to set in again later on). Lately I've been needing to take a second dose at night. I'm not taking it recreationally. I really feel the need to take it every time I do. My doctor never even mentioned the signs I need to look for when it comes to developing a tolerance. And he also never mentioned what tapering and withdrawal was going to look like. 
  
 

  So long story short. I want to get back to a place where the Xanax is only used in case of real emergencies. And I also have a zoloft prescription ready to be started (I've been sitting on it for a couple months out of panic over side effects/interactions). Zoloft was prescribed because my father developed a panic disorder in his late twenties and has found that Zoloft really works for him (I'm 35 for reference). 
  
 

  I have a couple questions.
  
 

  1. Zoloft starting dose is 25. Would the general consensus be to take it at that dose, or could I split it for a few weeks down to 12.5 due to my panic over side effects?
  
 

  2. Anyone on here have any advice for quitting benzos? I know you're supposed to taper, but can't find a good consensus on the best method/timeline.
  
 

  Other small side notes, the reason my concern has been elevated because lately I'm carrying an elevated heart rate all day (can range from high 80s up to 130 even without any real exertion), even after cutting back the caffeine (not enough, but any progress is progress). And I'm also noticing that I feel as though I'm having respiratory distress even though my O2 stays around 97 (Also a 20 year smoker, which I'm going to be working on quitting starting this week). 
  
 

  Sorry for the long post, it just always helps to get it out every once in a while. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read the whole thing."
"I am new to mental health issues &amp; therapy.
  
 

  I am currently trying to find a therapist that is accepting new patients &amp; struggling in my area.
  It seems like no one I have contacted is taking new patients!! They are all full!
  
 

  I have found a counselling office that is taking new patients offering “We have master level practicum counsellors, All councillors have completed their course work &amp; have previous experience working with mental health”
  
 

  I like this idea as it saves about $100/session to work with one of these practicum councillors (which is attractive as I’m not working right now due to health &amp; mental health - so money is tight!) but I also want to make sure I’m getting quality help!
  
 

  Has anyone had experience with a practicum councillor?
  
 

  Any insight is welcome!
  I just need help! Im really struggling mentally.

"I (35f) have a question about exercising when dealing with anxiety. Due to relationship issues I’ve developed this constant anxiety that I wake up with in the morning and doesn’t go away until I go back to sleep. It’s like my body is always on alert and nervous and I’m not sure how to deal with it. 
  I’ve been told that exercise helps and I used to very athletic so I do like working out. This generally involves running, biking or doing yoga. The problem I have however, is after every session I feel completely drained, pure physical exhaustion from an exercise that isn’t supposed to make me feel that way. I try refuelling after, eating well before but once the exhaustion kicks in I can’t get rid of it. I’m thinking it’s because of the constant anxiety and I was wondering if anyone else experiences this? Any advice on how to feel better? Thanks!!"
"I am 40 year old and working as a project manager in Indian IT service company. I started my career as a developer. Later I became manager. I think I have generalized anxiety problems. I am very stressed when I have to attend some meetings which are slightly different from my daily schedule. As a manager I cant survive without attending and driving meetings. My workload is too much as well. May be my generalized anxiety makes my workload higher as well. When i am stressed, i am not able to do anything and that piles up my work as well. I am not into technical work from quite sometime that will give me some trouble to get another work. I need to work late night as well since project is missing timeline. I wanted to work in 9 to 5 kind of job. My anxiety is troubling while thinking about job switch as well. Anyone gone through such phase. I am looking for your suggestions here."

"I don't know why I'm like this, but I'm absolutely petrified of moving on with my life. I finished an arts degree as a mature aged student a few years ago and got stuck in which now turns out to be a student home situation, as I have no control about who lives here. Just after I graduated in 2019, covid hit and I've been here since as rental prices have gone through the roof in the current climate.
  
 

  Now that everything is settling down again, I've lost heaps of hours at my current job and am not earning enough to be able to move out, so I'm currently looking for jobs in areas that I want to move to and can, as there are not many rentals available in my state, but the competition seems to be fierce around here - even data entry needs 5 years of experience. Everyone seems to want to move here as we have the sunshine and covid under control. 
  
 

  I've considered other states and things such as fruit picking, as that is something nobody seems to want to do here and you get cheap accommodation, but now I'm also scared that I am running out of time as my lease is up in December as well as my crippling anxiety of moving on. How does one get over this? The rational side of me says ""yes, do it, do it now"" but gets overshadowed by ""omg I can't do this"" if that makes sense. 
  
 

  I'm lost and scared."

I am 37 yo male. My wife is 36. We’ve known each other almost 20 years. We’ve been married for 12 years. Recently I would say maybe since 2020 she has been dealing with what I only know to call anxiety in the car mostly. I don’t think it’s really when she’s driving but when she’s a passenger. She gets really nervous when I drive or anyone drives. I should say I am not a bad driver. I haven’t had a speeding ticket in probably 14 years. I don’t swerve in and out of traffic. I don’t tailgate people. I don’t speed. I maintain safe following distance. But if a car in front of us even taps on their brakes and their brake lights go on she freaks like I’m not going to stop. She grabs the console and puts her other hand on the door just bracing for the worst impact. I try to help by being extra careful but she still gets nervous. She hasn’t had any kind of accidents recently either. No traumatic experiences. Nothing that I think would trigger this new emotions. Last night driving home from a concert she buried her face in her hands and began crying cause an 18 wheeler was in the lane next to us. What are my options here? How can I help her with these new fears? Once she went back to work after COVID and became a daily commuter again I thought the fears would go away. But they definitely haven’t. Idk if this matters but we had a kid in 2020. But no anxiety before or even during pregnancy. And anxiety can be with or without our child in the car.
"I've started going to the gym again for weight lifting. Not only do I want to change my body, I also usually feel better afterwards and I think it is an necessity for my long term approach to my anxiety.
  
 

  But during the gym session, I usually feel like shit. Especially after I just did a heavy set, I feel my heart pounding in my stomach (always there, don't know why) and my eyes feel 'slow'. I'm not dizzy, but it feels like I'm getting there.
  
 

  My heart rate doesn't spike extremely and I don't think there is anything 'wrong' with me, probably just out of shape and very aware of everything going on in my body. And anxiety wreaks havoc on our brains, so the eye thing is probably just some sort of tiredness. It's worse when I go the gym as opposed to working out at home, because of the fluorescent lighting in there.
  
 

  I'm doing this now 3-4x per week for about 4 weeks and it's not getting better. I started working out before, about 2 years ago and I remember the exact same physical sensations.
  
 

  1-2 minutes after the set the sensations usually pass and I'm back to normal until the next set.
  
 

  Does this sound familiar to anyone? And will it get better with time? Any tips and tricks?"
"Sometimes when I am about to fall asleep, I feel my body do weird stuff such as shallow breathing, weird spasms in my stomach, etc. I also become aware of my heartbeat (feel it in my chest or hands, or hear it because of my pulsatile tinnitus) and it either seems to miss a beat everytime I am about to drift off, or it's my consciousness being slowly shut off, so that I can no longer pay attention and therefore it only seems like it misses a beat.
  
 

  Whatever it is, this makes me instantly go up a level in consciousness or you could say become more awake again, which make the sensations stop. 10 seconds later I'm about to drift off again and the same stuff also happens again. And this goes in cycles.
  
 

  I get weird thoughts -&gt; My body does weird stuff - &gt; I become aware of it -&gt; Poof more awake -&gt; Try to fall asleep again. And repeat.
  
 

  It's absolutely terrible because I cannot sleep when this happens. Interestingly, this almost never happens when I go to bed at my regular bed time at night. Then the process of falling asleep feels more 'instant' and the body and mind seem to go to sleep at the same time.
  
 

  However, when I wake up in the early morning this might happen sometimes. And when I take a nap during the day, this is almost guaranteed to happen.
  
 

  Why does this happen? Are there too few 'sleep hormones' / melatonin in my body in the afternoon / early morning? Any other physical causes that could cause this? Sleep apnea?
  
 

  I also have an anxiety disorder so I am sure I am more aware of things than most folks and maybe higher stress levels in general. But this also happens when I feel 'relaxed' and tired sometimes.
  
 

  Any help is appreciated because this prevents me from sleeping, which I absolutely need more of.
  
 

  Thanks so much."
"I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and OCD 15 years ago. I'm 36 years old. I've had ups and downs. 
  
 

  My anxiety and intrusive thoughts have been a lot the past year. However, I am noticing that my brain isn't as sharp, I feel like my memory isn't the same, especially short term and I feel like my brain is slow. 
  
 

  Health anxiety is my major one. Trying to tell myself that it isn't Alzheimer's, but I'm obsessively googling.... I hate the googling... Ugggggghhjjj 
  
 

  
 

  Help. 
  Maybe I just need encouragement or someone to tell me they experience the same during more complex mental health episodes."
"Certain lighting situations really set me off in a bad way. It's those bright white spots. Often used in restaurants. And of course the fluorescent lighting in supermarkts and hardware stores.
  
 

  They make me feel uneasy, unsteady and almost dizzy. It seems to trigger an anxiety response, physically, even when I tell myself it's just the light and my anxiety causing this and there is nothing to worry about, it makes me feel unwell. 
  
 

  Now I know that this is part of my anxiety disorder, but can anyone explain why this happens? A few years ago these types of lighting didn't affect me so badly. And now, even on a good day this can really catch me of guard and make me feel bad.
  
 

  The moment I leave the building and step outside, things clear up quickly.
  
 

  Anyone else experiences this? Why does it happen you think? And what helps? Special sunglasses? Light therapy? Anything else?"
How do I start feeling better about life?
So I have massive trembling and shaking anytime I go to the barbers and sit on that fucking chair I have had 2 chamomile teas so far and have to go in an hour or so any advice will be appreciated
"So a quick background I (37f) have suffered with mental health problems for pretty much my whole life due to childhood trauma and various fucked up things that went on around me. 
  I have never had a formal diagnosis other than maybe anxiety and depression. 
  I was on antidepressants from the age of 15 until my late 20s when I decided to try the medication free route. 
  Overall I’ve made big steps forward, I’m learning to live healthier and do the things that are good for me mentally but on occasion I do have some bad mood swings. 
  This is causing major problems in my relationship, and I feel like a brat. 
  I would consider myself to be a nice person, but when I think of the way I behave sometimes I really think I’m not. 
  Does anyone have any advice? How can I stop this acting out?"
"But I need help and advice or maybe someone with same experience.
  
 

  I have never made one of these posts before, I probably need to go see a psychologist but thought I would reach out here for opinions or recommendations.
  
 

  I am 36. When I was younger I had a lot of depression and social anxiety up until I was like 23. It seems I was able to cure it though with 20mg of celexa and to be honest I became an alcoholic until I was 27. I drank every night alone usually and 18 pack of beer, had no job and lived with my parents and took advantage of that. At 27I got in trouble with the law for drinking and went to jail for 10 days and that was so intense for me that it made me stop drinking. I have been sober for 9 years. Got a job and my own apt and had been ok. There are still a lot of normal things other people do that I don’t though. For example, I have not had a gf since I was 21, and I am not sexually active with other people, I have a sex drive! If you know what I mean, daily. I just do not have the urge to get a gf. I choose to sit alone and watch tv shows and play video games after work. During the first 3 years after my 10 days in jail I still lived with my parents but they got a “grey divorce”. Meaning, they were in their 60s and got divorced and a part of me thinks it was my fault. I am so angry at my dad because it seems like he initiated it and I have to take care of my mom. I drive over to my moms house every single day to be with her and I am not sure how that is affecting me.
  
 

  As the pandemic happened a new issue arose. I decided I wanted to go to grad school to work as a data engineer. When this started, both the pandemic and the starting of grad school I had the worst generalized anxiety disorder in the world. I tried everything from meditation (transcendental meditation) to breathing, to exercise, my dr increased my celexa to 40mg, I got some benzos, but I try and only take them if it gets really bad as I know from my alcoholism how easy it can be to get addicted to something. Sometimes I could not even get out of bed to do my school work because the anxiety and dread was too much. I graduated with my masters in data engineering one of the best in my class. Started a job as a consultant where every new project I am given I break down and my generalized anxiety disorder strikes again, I have no idea what I am doing, no experience or training outside my school and when I ask for help I do not get the time I need with my peers. Little things will set off my gad, my mom got Covid and that made me lay one bed for 4 days with worry and fear. Trouble sleeping all the time. I have lost interest in alot of my old hobbies. I wake up with a voice telling me I wish I was dead because of the worry feeling, BUT I am not suicidal if that makes sense? I want to live, to take care of my mom, even something stupid like playing a new video game makes me want to live. So even though I have suicidal thoughts there’s nothing to them no real planning or reality behind them. I love living. My 40mg of celexa blunts my depression (if I even have depression anymore) but I think it blunts everything else as well like my hobbies. But it does not seem to help with gad. My gad is really bad in the morning and gets better as the day goes on and almost disappears at night. Repeat the next day, muscle pains everywhere.
  
 

  Anyone struggled with gad? Or my type of history? Anyone have advice?"
"Last year I had problems with my stool for about 3-4 months in a row. This year I'm already at 4 months or so.
  
 

  It's like in between 'normal' stool and diarrhea. I need to go to the toilet 2-3x per day, most of the days.
  
 

  There are 2 possible causes I think:  
  \- My anxiety causes food intolerances or excess stress hormones which in their turn speed up the digestion process
  
 

  \- I have food intolerances or something else that cause both digestion problems as well as my anxiety symptoms
  
 

  They seem to go hand in hand, that's for sure. But there are also days when I am not anxious at all, but still have the same problems.
  
 

  It's not a huge deal per se, but I do have the feeling it also makes me more tired and have fewer energy, as well as the inability to gain weight and thus gain muscle mass. 
  
 

  Anyone else in the same boat? Anything I can try besides what I already did:  
  \- Pro-biotics  
  \- Stopping dairy for 3 weeks (no effect)  
  \- Eating enough fiber
  
 

  Thanks!"
"I should stop watching TikTok… I just saw one of a young gal who had odd symptoms, was dismissed a few times, then was diagnosed with a rare cancer. I have health anxiety and although I don’t have the symptoms she had, I now am paranoid about that type of cancer (so dumb). It’s a rare type most common in teens, and I am not a teenager lol. 
  
 

  Anyone else get triggered from TikToks? Or other videos and spiral irrationally?"
"M35 here. I was diagnosed 18 months ago with ADHD, and just 2 weeks ago in therapy, my psychologist told me that she believes I have an anxiety problem - a significant one. 
  
 

  I knew I struggled with it, but kind of figured it was normal, since I've been anxious literally my entire life. 
  
 

  I've been thinking about it now for 2 weeks, and it's only just sunk in today. 
  
 

  Where do I even start, guys? Meditation is a huge priority, I believe."
"This weekend I (37F) and my husband (34m) are going out of town with a group of his friends to a cabin on a lake to boat and relax. Usually, I would drink until my insecurities and anxiety was dulled but now I'm pregnant. I know the people we are going with, they're all his friends since I don't really have any, but the thought of being there all weekend without alcohol as a crutch is giving me anxiety attacks. I asked him if he could just go alone but he refuses to leave me home and says he wouldn't have fun without me. He really is a great husband and I want him to get to relax and enjoy himself as he's always giving in to me wanting to be a home body. We've went on other trips with this group and I always just feel awkward and isolated. It's not them, it's purely me. I know everyone will be drinking so that helps me a little knowing they probably won't notice me, but how can I make it easier on him and myself and try to relax? And good strong masking tips? I even considered maybe smoking, but in the past its given me anxiety attacks and of course I don't want to hurt the baby. Please. Any advice to help make my husband's weekend relaxing is much appreciated."

"I need to move on from an escalated work situation, and now my mother who also has anxiety, but different to mine, is making my life a living hell at the moment. I'm 35 and have been stuck in what now turned out to be shared University Accommodation since covid 2 years ago. Through inflation in the country, its also impossible to rent my own unit, or even find one, since every rich person in every other state wants to move to ours, because of the relaxed rules and sunshine. Homelessness is at an all time high because of this matter. 
  
 

  I don't know why, but I think Covid did a thing to me mentally, as I'm too scared to move on, but cannot tolerate being abused by both my job and my parents any longer. For those of you who say ""just do it"", it's really not that simple for some of us, and I am genuinely terrified that I will have to renew my lease again in 6 weeks time.

"Hi all, first time posting. I’m a 37f who has been dealing with anxiety for almost 20 years. I’m the past year or so I feel so crippled by it that I’m not sure how to keep going. Anxiety and depression have killed all my love of life. I’m not capable of enjoying anything anymore; anytime I start to feel like I’m having a good time I just start worrying about the next thing to go wrong. 
  
 

  I started a new job about two months ago that I tolerate but don’t enjoy. It’s a low-level admin job that I took so I wouldn’t be stressed at work, but I feel like I’m stressed anyway. I have a masters degree and several advanced certificates, but I have severe imposter syndrome and the idea of taking a job I’m qualified for terrifies me. Instead I just worry about being a single person living alone and making ends meet. 
  
 

  Every part of my life feels unhealthy, mind body and soul. I know I need to find a therapist and talk to a doctor about adjusting my meds (I’ve been on Lexapro since I was 19 but I’m pretty sure it needs adjusting) but I’m so overwhelmed by EVERYTHING, including just going online and making the appointments. 
  
 

  I know there are a lot of little things I could do that would be steps in the right direction, and I know that any lasting positive change is going to be the result of baby steps, not huge overnight overhauls of my habits. But I have such trouble not looking at where I am now, comparing it to where I want to be, and not seeing an insurmountable mountain in between. 
  
 

  Anyway. I don’t know what the point of this post is, other than I’m home sick today (and of course freaked out that my coworkers are going to think I’m a slacker even though I’m pretty sure I have the flu) and I just needed to “vocalize” these feelings. I guess I’m just hoping for some reassurance that I’m not alone in feeling so stuck."
"First up, I have been on new meds, severe anxiety, depression, panic.
  
 

  Stopped zoloft and started paxil, no more 24/7 migraine, I smile, I engage, I fist bump, and most importantly, I don't recoil in terror from a pat on my back or shoulders. 
  
 

  I'm hoping this is my new norm. 
  
 

  I just suffered a bout of constipation. we're looking into why, I'm 40, first event like this, Finally got things moving, but. . I gotta doc appt Monday. I HOPE I just ripped something. 
  
 

  I'm focused, calm, laughing, already leading work cheer in front of the other new hires. 
  
 

  I haven't been this clear headed and not defensive since before I was 10. 
  
 

  We're starting eye movement therapy on 11/11 for my PTSD. 
  
 

  I was looking at people, in the eye, directly facing them today. :) and wasn't thinking about being attacked. 
  
 

  Long road ahead. Longer one behind, and a boy much less prepared already did that. I know, with my tools, I will be okay. :)"
Does anxiety ever affect your ability to have sex and have you found ways to overcome it in the moment? I'm 37 and have not had problems up to a few years ago. My general anxiety got worse and there were a few instances where that affected me in the bedroom. After that I started getting worried it would happen again and it became a self fulfilling prophecy. Now instead of being excited for sexy time with the wife I feel worried because I'm worried I'll be worried... And then I worry.
"I have recently been diagnosed as having GAD or Panic disorder. It all started with a sudden physical feelings in my body with no thoughts in my mind to cause such feelings
  
 

  I am 40 have have no past of anxiety. From there I have somehow spiraled. I have taken a bunch of different medicines over the past few months trying to find a mental health answer and last week finally had to take a benzo for the first time. It relaxed my symptoms. 
  
 

  So while calm and collected I come to this group and ask. Every day I wake up feeling normal(after sleeping with a sleep aid) until the afternoon and the physical signs of my anxiety only stop with a benzo and my mind stays exactly the same. No change in racing thoughts. Just pure physical anxiety type symptoms. (Headache for 7 weeks, tight jaw, tightness in my mid section) 
  
 

  Ambien was attempted as a sleep aid but it only kept me asleep 2-3 hours max. My arms tingle and legs tingle all the time. I feel a bit hopeless or lost. Please someone help!"
"So in theory I should be sleeping like a baby. 
  I had off today, I got my hair done, my boyfriend came home. We had a great date. We've been cuddling.
  BUT of course. We go to bed. Him and the dog pass out. It is 3 am and I'm on the couch. 
  I can't sleep. My heart is racing. I feel nauseated. I'm in a straight panic. Over what? Couldn't tell you. But now I'm on the couch watching TV so I don't wake up the mister or the dog. 
  I don't feel great. So of course I immediately assume the worst. 
  I would take my hydroxyzine but I had two beers at dinner.
  I keep telling myself I'm ok. I'm really annoyed because the past three nights I was finally falling asleep by just drinking sleepy tea. No meds. 
  
 

  Anyone else go through this?"
"I have a very long history of anxiety, and panic attacks. It started at 14 when I developed severe headaches due to excessive video gaming and progressed from that point on. Luckily in my late 20's, the headaches regressed on their own, and I was able to drastically reduce anxiety and PAs with medication. I'm 40 now.
  
 

  Sadly about 8 years ago I developed severe driving anxiety. At first it was just general fear. I immediately hated driving when I was getting my license in my mid 20's. The whole thing felt excessively dangerous, difficult, tedious. I pushed through, got my license started driving. At first, I was actually improving and even sometimes relaxed a little. Everything changed when I had to get on a highway. The feeling of gaining speed absolutely terrifies me. I get racing thoughts of losing control and spinning out killing myself and others in the process. I feel trapped, whenever there's no immediate exit and no shoulder to pull off to. Many areas of the highway have absolutely no exists and nowhere you can pull off to if it needs to be done immediately. You cannot just ""stop and breathe"". You have to keep going because there's always someone behind you. This feeling of ""being pushed"" to go faster, to maintain speed is killing me. Oftentimes I absolutely have to slow down to around 20mph to ""get a grip"" and I am sure you understand what will happen if I do that in the middle of a major bridge or a tunnel.
  
 

  Exposure therapy doesn't help here, because with exposure therapy, one must be able to STOP if something doesn't feel right and come back to it again and again when able. With highways, you cannot just stop. Meds do not help for this. Self-talk does not work. 
  
 

  It's gotten so bad, that now, I get anxiety even when driving on streets in the city. I am still able to push through for now, but it's getting worse.
  
 

  Someone suggested hypnosis but its prohibitively expensive, and some say it can actually make things worse! I am lost and depressed over this because in America, ONE MUST DRIVE. No exceptions. Men who do not drive are shunned by society and rejected by women. No one wants to deal with a man who doesn't drive."
"Hi, as you guys can tell, i live in NYC. i am 37 yrs old and have never driven in home country. I have taken many hrs of driving lessons and though had good comments from instructors, i have failed the NYC test twice. 
  
 

  One of the things i would say has not worked in favor is having some of the rudest people as my inspectors, whose only jobs seems to be making it worse for you when you make a small mistake so that you end up making a blunder. 
  
 

  Here is what a NY test includes
  
 

  \- Red lights
  
 

  \- Stop signs
  
 

  \- Right and Left turns
  
 

  \- Parallel parking, sometimes in small spaces.
  
 

  
  Now I am thinking of taking the test somewhere in upstate where i have heard its easier. I don't intend to drive in NYC, this is just a license to be able to drive and practice in suburban areas as think of moving away in future. 
  
 

  Any advice on future course of action would be appreciated.
  
 

  thanks in advance."

I know this is for social anxiety but I think most of us also have performance anxiety..like in the workplace. Are there any jobs or careers where you're not watched while at work?
"I (35f) have been feeling so exhausted and hopeless lately. I guess I am looking for some companionship in these feelings. I want to make changes in my life. I want to change my job and get in better shape. I feel like I am physically restricted by lack of energy. I try and push myself, but all my body wants to do is sleep. When it comes to taking the steps to make changes like apply for a job and figure out a better schedule, it feels like I become paralyzed by anxiety and want to completely shut down. Is there anyone else who feels like they have the motivation and want to make changes like a job or move, but feel physically restricted by exhaustion and anxiety?"
"I'm hoping someone can shed some light on their symptoms and share their list as well. 
  
 

  I've been struggling with anxiety for more than half my life. I'm 36 now. It often manifests as health anxiety. 
  
 

  But sometimes the physical symptoms I experience leave me astounded that this can be ""just anxiety"". It's so difficult drawing a line and going to the Dr and waiting it out.
  I am going through a stressful time, starting to work in a month after being a house wife for 11 years as well as moving towns. But I try to be calm mostly. So can anxiety symptoms still present themselves even if I am not physically anxious? 
  I'm not currently on medication nor have I ever been. But I'm seriously considering it because this is just getting too much for me.
  
 

  I've diagnosed myself with every cancer, and serious illness under the sun in the past. The latest has been Multiple sclerosis. 
  I've been having tingles and odd feelings in different parts. It almost always sorts itself out after 24h. But can come back in a different location but never lasts overly long. I've had tingles in my nose, right side off my body, left hand fingers.
  I go through periods of dizziness and vertigo.
  I'm irratable and snappy.
  My shoulders are always tense, I have to tell myself to release them and relax multiple times a day. 
  I've been getting left sided little shocks in my head and feels like behind my eye. 
  I'm tired. 
  Last night before bed my thoughts were racing and I jerked awake a few times.
  Frequently need the bathroom.
  
 

  This had just been the last couple of days. I know I'm not imagining these. They are real and it's tiresome always dealing with a physical symptom of sorts.
  
 

  I made a Dr appointment next week just to be sure but it's so so so debilitating.
  
 

  And then when I browse all the disorder subs on reddit that I've diagnosed myself with or google it's even worse because I match every symptoms.
  
 

  In the past when I've gone to Dr's with symptoms they have always said it's anxiety. But this is just too much. 
  
 

  Please, if anyone can relate of offer their experience it will be very much appreciated."
"Anyone else have this problem? I feel like I have weird feelings in my teeth all the time and I’m really scared my front teeth will fall out. 
  It means I have to be really gentle with brushing and can’t bite down on food with those teeth.

"TLDR; need anxiety coping mechanisms you use in the heat of being mid-anxiety spiral. 
  
 

  35f with 
  - ADD
  - Mild depression (never medicated)
  - Pretty severe anxiety (self-medicated with extreme overeating.)
  - ———
  - currently on Vyvanse for ADD
  - in bi-weekly therapy
  
 

  I am 6 weeks post-op for Gastric Bypass. Because of my surgery: I can’t eat away the anxiety. I technically “can” drink, but I should not. I’m not a drinker… but I have been craving one for days. I just want the anxiety to go away. 
  
 

  I am on day four of a complete anxiety spiral. Work stress, exacerbated 1) my surgery 2) my father having a severe stroke 8 weeks ago. 
  
 

  Over four days, I have tried:
  
 

  - Updating my resume and applying for jobs to take back control by 1) reminding myself I am not trapped, I’m choosing to stay and 2) a reminder I have a fantastic work situation. 
  - I got a mani/pedi for some self care
  - Went out to early dinner with my parents Friday, a good friend 4 hours later also on Friday (I had about 1/4 cup protein at each meal)
  - Did a little retail therapy related to my main hobby, and engaged in that hobby. 
  - Took my parents out Saturday evening for a Zoo-light holiday type event (get my dad walking and mentally engaged) then a nice dinner. 
  - I have started planning a vacation abroad for spring ‘23
  - I have spoken with my friends and parents about my work stressors and the best path forward. 
  
 

  In the heat of the moment, these things are helping. Typing this out helps the tightness in my chest loosen, breathing a bit easier, and the feeling of dread dissipate. 
  
 

  
 

  Help? Ideas?"
"Hello everybody. ive been struggling with social anxiety, depression and gad the last 10 years i am 35 yrs of age now and until 9 months ago never worked a day in my life, other than a few jobs where I just couldn't last due to sa and work paranoia. I'm so proud of myself I've lasted 9 months in this job I've had some miserable day's in work due to this crippling mental disease. I wanted to run so many times, ive took xanax to get through days in work and they really helped. I don't think sa will ever leave me but I can honestly say that working has helped me manage it a little bit better. Fact is guys some ppl are just quiet in general and that's ok. There's ppl in my job who are super quiet that also made me feel less pressured to talk :) sorry for the essay just thought I'd share for anyone struggling or worried about starting work"
"Yesterday I finally started taking Sertraline for GAD and PD. I was prescribed 25mg for a week and then I'll be put up to 50mg. I'm really anxious about the side effects. I've only taken one dose so far, just before bed last night. I slept fine but woke up feeling groggy, had some breakfast and then went back to bed for a couple of hours as I'm not working today. I have this huge fear of passing out or being sick in public and I have to go out later so that's really the only thing I'm worrying about right now as I'd read that nausea and dizziness are possible side effects. Could anyone who's taken this drug before tell me their experience, provide some reassurance or anything they did that helped in the first couple of weeks?"
"I have had non stop physical anxiety symptoms since 8/1/22. Before that day I have never had any medical or anxiety issues. Since then I have been to every doctor I can think of and I’m still at ground zero. 
  
 

  Every day I have a headache, tingling toes and hands, I swallow air all the time. My jaw is locked down tight and I have tingling all over my face. I can’t sleep except for a combination benzos and sleep meds. 
  
 

  Benzos are no longer slowing or stopping my physical anxiety symptoms. I’ve been on two med attempts during that time(anti depressants and now coupled with buspar) and the result is the same. I have a super calm mind and body that rebels. 
  
 

  I’ve been in twice a week counseling. I went part time at work. I run or row almost every day. I’ve done everything I can do and nothing is getting better and I’m running out of give a fuck."
"So I'm 36 and I haven't been a follower of Christianity since I was 27, but I still have a fear of going to hell when I die. I've smoked weed a bunch of times with no negative side effects but a handful of times I've had sever panic episodes that for hours and they're all centered on the idea that I'm in some form of hell, or damned, and that when I die, that's when the really bad stuff is going to happen.
  
 

  Yesterday I tried to get this full spectrum CBD oil (extra strength) and I couldn't get much out of the bottle with my dropper so I tried pouring some into my tea but a bunch came out, so I drank it. I've been informed that if you eat the oil a lot of the CBD gets filtered out by your liver but not the TCH. So I had a full-on attack that lasted 6+ hours and I'm still on edge and having extremely intrusive thoughts today. Basically the gist of the voice in my head (that is supposedly God the Father?) was insulting me and how lukewarm I am (my name is Luke and there's that spat you out of my mouth verse) and my shortcomings. But also claiming that I'm Satan and I'm being punished by being reincarnated over and over and that this entire universe is a simulation just for me and no one is real. And it said that any evidence or logic to disprove this theory was just a purposeful obfuscation of the truth (that I'm Satan and damned). So it said to ""Go ahead and get therapy and do research. Your hope is delicious."" It said that I needed to convert my girlfriend, who it labeled as God, to Christianity... even though she kind of already believes in it, though doesn't really go to church. It also said that the Bible in my universe was purposefully flawed so that I wouldn't believe it. And the voice said I'd progressively get crazier and the next time we'd speak was when I'm 70.
  
 

  Anyway... I know this sounds really insane, but it's just sticking in my brain because it's like a self-proving conspiracy theory and any evidence that contradicts it is actually evidence for it. I'm a pretty high-strung individual as it is, but this fear is just more than I can bare. My logical brain tells me that it's just the weed talking... but these few brushes I've had with an entity claiming to be a vengeful god are the worst experiences I've had in my life and I don't want them to become permeant mental scars. Any advice or reassurance would help. Though the voice in my head would say it's all part of this elaborate simulation. ugh"
"Take a deep breath... you feel that? That's you, alive. I know you're struggling and have been for some time. Life feels hard and terrifying right now and you don't know that it'll ever get better. It can. You're not broken. These feelings you keep having are your brain trying to keep you safe, it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do, maybe a little too well! Remember that these feelings can't hurt you and they DO NOT define you. You are more than chemicals. You are the same person you were before these struggles. I know you're tired, you're working so hard. It will pay off, you will breathe easier again. Keep going but rest when you need to. I'm rooting for you!"
"I'm in the middle of a career switch and I seriously doubt if I'll be able to work a full-time job that requires me to be around people all the time. I made huge progress and my social anxiety is at its lowest level since I can remember (I'm 35 years old), but it's still quite draining to be around people. I'm doing a course at the moment that has two days of class a week and even after two months it feels like it's too much.
  
 

  I sometimes read stories of people with social anxiety that started a job with a lot of human interaction and it's helped them get better. Any of you that can tell me how long that took? Is it weeks or months? 
  
 

  I'm thinking that if it drains me so much it's better to focus on a job that I can do from home. The field I'm switching to is videography, so there are possibilities for that. It's just that in theory working with other people and creating cool things together is so much fun. In reality, however, I do better when I'm alone. When spending time with people I need a day off for every day of work/school, and it feels like a struggle. So my question is: should I continue being around people for longer or just focus on creating a job that works for me? 
  
 

  Of course, you guys can't answer that question for me, but I would love to hear your stories &lt;3"
"My wife (F40) and I (F36) have been together for 5 years and have two 6 month-old babies (we gave birth to one each, one week apart). She has been taking anxiety meds since she was a teenager and goes to therapy. However, since the outbreak of Covid-19, which coincided with her going through 2 miscarriages and 1 abortion (the baby was too sick to survive), I've felt like I have become the prisoner of her anxiety.
  
 

  To put things in context, we have been stuck in our house since February 2020 (Covid, working from home, parental leave). We live in sleepy suburbs in Scandinavia with 1 café and 3 shabby restaurants, no nice nature to take walks in, only houses and asphalt roads. We love each other dearly and enojy spending time together, but being stuck in the same house 24/7 for 3 years cannot be good for anyone.
  
 

  I am from another European country, an hour flight from where we live, but everytime I want to meet my family she gets an anxiety attack. The 3 times I flew to my home country during Covid I always had 2 flight tickets back in case she gets extreme anxiety and wants me to get home early. Whenever I say I want to fly home she gets a panic attack. Before, she was worried I would get Covid, now she doesn't want to be left alone with the baby.
  
 

  When her biological baby was born, we drove to the mental health emergency room twice because after loosing 3 babies, she was so worried something might be wrong. She has since changed her meds, goes to therapy with the baby once a week, and we have been assigned an amazing babysitter who comes to help us every morning for 4 hours.
  
 

  I am always tiptoeing around her doing my best not to make her stressed or anxious. But that means that my own life has come to a standstill. Meanwhile, I have also given birth to a baby. At the same time, I have been pretty chill throughout my own pregnancy and my biological child is also very calm, while hers cries a lot more. So it's all about her and her bio child since me and my bio child are ""just fine"". (And before anyone judges me for making the ""my bio - her bio"" kid split: they are obviously OUR kids but it's extremely difficult splitting everything 50/50 when one is breastfed, the other is bottle fed, and they're not synched. So, yes, her bio kid is mostly with her, and my bio kid is mostly with me. We do ""exchange"" kids whenever possible to bond with both and work towards splitting childcare 50/50 when they eat regular food.)
  
 

  The current pressing issue is my wanting to introduce the babies to my 91-year-old grandpa before he dies. He has been moved to an old peoples home and is not doing very well. The babies are named after him and my grandma (his wife) who died two weeks before the babies were born. My grandpa cries on the phone with me because he wants to meet them. But my wife refuses to take the plane because she is 100% sure we would all get measles AND Covid. My bio child is getting the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine next week and then I really want to travel home with him. So now it's time to book the flights, but my wife has a full-on panic attack because of it, and I feel bad for causing it.
  
 

  If I cancel the trip it would be because she changed her meds only a month ago, has a lot of anxiety and does not want to be alone with a 6-month-old baby (well, her mum would come to stay with her, and we also have the babysitter who comes every day). But then my grandpa might die without getting to meet one of his grandsons.
  
 

  Am I a bad person if I leave her for 5 days?
  
 

  And, more importantly, how can we move forward so that I can live my life without causing her anxiety? This is a reoccuring problem - I want to do something but she gets anxious. So I either don't do it and get frustrated, or do as I want and she gets an anxiety attack that I feel responsible for.
  
 

  Our therapists say that I should be able to do what I want, but it's SO difficult when I see how much anxiety I cause her."
"Yet another ER visit. I have gone to the ER four times in a year. 
  This time I woke up at 3 am. Sweating profusely, heart pounding and I threw up. Never had that happen before. My parents are here for the holidays so I woke my mom up,. I'm almost 40.
  She sat with me. I couldn't get it together. She took me to the ER at 5 am. Test ran. Bp great, heart rate great,EkG perfect, no fever, blood work spot on, chest scan was fine, No COVID. No flu. Just a little low on potassium. But that's it. They sent me home. Ive been uncomfortable all day. I finally gave in and took a hydroxyzine. I missed a weekend out with my sister and boyfriend. We had planned to go to a concert and I ended up home all day.
  I'm getting so sick of it. I'm in therapy. I need to get in a workout plan again and get my food right again. 
  I'm starting to think I have a hormonal imbalance. I need to find a doctor who is willing to really dive into this with me. I want to go back to having a good fun and healthy life. I hate this so much."
"So I am looking into getting a weighted blanket, and I am wondering what weight to get. 36f at 5ft tall weighing about 100lbs. Most of what I can find are 15lb blankets but they are recommended for body weight 120lb and up. I already use 3 somewhat heavy blankets that I would like to replace with one. Should I look for 10 or 12 pound blankets or would 15lb be fine to use?"
"Been dating this girl (F36) for about 3 months. Early on months before we were official I (M34) kept putting are dates off since I just wasn't sure I wanted to date yet. I almost wanna get back to that but im kinda falling now. I do really like her and we both have kids but the anxiety I feel is just fu**ed! It's like I have this need when we're not together to be assured that I'm her one man. We only text (I'm not much for calling). If she don't text right away or I notice changes (however small) I start to worry. Then later that night we might text a bit and I'll feel full again. It's like a roller coaster in my mind. I think man she's great and really likes me to, is she losing interest?? to, is she seeing other guys and then back to feeling good. I swear it's like cancer and not healthy.
  
 

  I've had this happen my last big relationship and my texting changed to the point it made my ex distraught and feeling I didn't like her anymore, but then she ended up cheating on me. So I was left thinking did I ruin our relationship by being in my head and changing my text habits or did I actually see changes in her text and my suspicions were justified? Because in the end she did cheat which is something I don't do or forgive.
  
 

  My current girlfriend has been great so far it's just texting makes me question things. She will seem uninterested at time but then she'll talk about buying gifts for Christmas for me and my daughter. She's also planned something special for me in April of next year and I should make sure I'm off a few days that month.
  
 

  Insecurities I've got I'm sure 😞 I hate to think that my constant need to be shown I'm hers would ruin the relationship in time! I keep it all in right now and have not shared any of this with her cause I know it's a huge 🚩. I've got a best friend I talk to about some of this and he says just enjoy it man! Wish I could be the me a few month ago that wasnt so worried and have fun!
  
 

  Sorry if this was a bit long I just wanted to vent my feelings, thanks! But also looking for any advice."
"Hi everyone I'm looking for a anxiety and depression buddy, I would like to get to know someone who lives in Hamilton New Zealand where I live so I can have someone to contact in dark times and they can contact me, and I want to be able to say I will be there in a second if you need me. I'm a 38m and I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for 18 years, I'm a introvert and I love to read books and watch movies. If this sounds like something that you could be into pm me thanks"
"Anyone else get confused looks from others when you start a conversation? I honestly don't understand why I got said look from my co-worker. Yesterday, I said something in regards to a follow up about a conversation we had the day before. That was when I got the confused look/stare. I was pretty sure I made myself clear and consice, but I guess not, so I elaborated and they finally got it. 
  
 

  I have worked so hard to get my social anxiety under control but that interaction brought up some old feelings. It makes me never want to talk to people. I do realize that sometimes I don't make myself very clear, that's okay, I just elaborate and move on but this interaction really got to me. It seems like a silly thing to get upset over but I felt so embarrassed."
"I have headaches almost daily, but I've also experienced two migraines with visual aura for the first time ever - once in January and again in March. I'm 35. Saw my GP yesterday and she said since she isn't a headache specialist, she'd refer me to a neurologist if that would make me more comfortable. She did labwork and everything was fine. Before seeing her, I had a dilated eye exam and there weren't any issues there either. What can I expect from a neurologist's visit?"
"Does this happen to you too?
  
 

  I had a panic attack last saturday and still haven't fully recovered from it, physically. I sleep poorly and wake up a lot. Today I had the nervous feeling in my stomach area all day. I also get more hungry these days.
  
 

  Does this sound familiar too you? As bad as panick attacks are, it could be nice if they at least only lasted for the duration of the attack itself. But unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case for me."
"For the majority of my life I (38m). have been told (and was given a full evaluation and diagnosis as a kid) that I have ADHD Inattentive type.
  I have never had doctors second guess or suggest further evaluation.
  
 

  Well fast forward to yesterday, I had my results from a full evaluation, ADHD, learning disability, IQ, dyslexia and dyscalculia.
  
 

  The psychologist explained that the tests do not support ADHD, but instead sustained depression and general anxiety disorder, a math learning disability and heres the kicker PTSD.
  
 

  I guess I just need to find a new therapist but I am not familiar with PTSD without significant traumatic events. I guess I just don’t understand or have not been exposed to what a traumatic experience and response is (like in a clinical sense).
  
 

  I have no memory of anything extremely traumatic in my life, but I also don’t understand if there is some sort of threshold in what qualifies a traumatic response?
  
 

  I am not arguing the diagnosis, but like, can anxiety really display ADHD like symptoms?
  Focus, tracking, organization, recall, following directions, REMEMBERING a direction and being able to understand how to apply it immediately after reading it?
  
 

  
 

  Has anyone else experienced this sort of thing?
  
 

  Edit: added missed words/clarification."
"I feel like time keeps slipping away from me. I become so anxious thinking about memories and knowing that they're in the past and I'll never get them back. I think about how the way I feel right now at 21 years old is the way I'll feel when I'm 40 or 50 or 60. that time is constant and i can't do anything to stop it. it's a constant thought in my head, and it keeps me up at night. I don't wanna die but I wish I didn't have to deal with time and the process of aging"
I feel like this place is mostly under 25s with no kids. Anyone else here who suffers with SA and has kids. I think I asked this before on here but I can't find the thread.
I accept that I am a mostly negative person because it's been drummed into me to be that way by my mother. I'm also in a job I don't wanna be in not making much money but I don't know how to change my general attitude to make myself better. I sometimes wish I had better parents so I wouldn't be this way but that's obviously not gonna happen. Does anyone else struggle with this? I spend most of my time alone and it's hard. My spouse doesn't like being around me.
"Somehow I blinked and here I am. I have had a full mental breakdown in the last 9 months and have been working with therapist and doing EMDR for months. I lost my best friend in an accident (I was with him) at 18. Never processed it. I have a very high stress job. Lost people I loved during pandemic but was helpless in California where the pandemic raged and politicized everyone. I blink and all of a sudden I turn 40 in two weeks and everything feels so arbitrary. Like what am I doing? What’s the point of all of this? I’m more successful than I ever thought I’d be and have the family I’ve dreamed of but I work all Of the time and am constantly “holding it all together”. Like I’m just trying to get to 50-55 and retire early. Literally forfeiting my life. 
  Have others struggled with milestone birthdays? I feel my baseline is just through the damn roof as the underlying stability of my life - happiness with work and family - is called to question. 
  
 

  Hot mess express over here"
"So I have nocturnal panic attacks I would say micro panic attacks they happen always during the first hour when I fall asleep. Usually I am waking up jumping from my bed with shortness of breath and high HR and most important I am screaming something like ""I am dying help me etc"". Attacks are very short 10 seconds max 30. After it I can sleep but often I have another one and another one and the I shut down until the morning. Why I have them only at night? I don't have anxiety or panic attacks during the day. They are so scary. Especially screaming part. It's like mix of anxiety and night terrors. I have them since my 20's and now I am 37. Sometimes I am tired from them. Nobody can't help me one thing that helps me are benzo before bed but I don't want get addiction so I don't use them. I did apnea test result came back negative. Funny thing I don't have attacks in the middle of the night or in the morning. Just during the first hour of my sleep. Anyone with similar problem?"
"I would so much appreciate anyone who would like to read my story and maybe tell their own. I (39F) have been suffering the past few years off and on with some crippling health anxiety. It started with fear of cancer on my tonsils as I saw what I thought was a bump on my tonsil and Googled....yes, I know, big mistake. Well since I have also previously had an hpv positive pap test, I was convinced I had throat cancer from hpv. Saw an ENT who was completely unconcerned and calmed down about that.
  I lost some weight, started feeling good and for about a year things were fine. Then out of nowhere I began worrying again. First it was some lymph nodes that convinced me I either had throat cancer or lymphoma, next it was inflammatory breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cancer on my gums, cancer in my cheek, regular breast cancer, thyroid cancer, skin cancer, Lobular breast cancer, and now I'm back to thinking I have Hpv related cancer, only this time in my lingual tonsils. 
  This is becoming my personal hell. Just when I receive clearance for one thing from a scan/test/biopsy, I am worried about another. To the point of obsessing all day. I can barely function. Whatever my current worry is, it's constantly on my mind. I can barely eat, sleep gets broken up and I'm irritable all the time. I look at my 9 year old girl and my heart breaks at the thought of her losing me. She is particularly attached to me. My husband is very dismissive. He gets annoyed with me and I understand becauseI know it is annoying. I have no friends to talk to. 
  I am aware of how pathetic this all makes me seem but I'm so miserable I'm willing to put it all out there lol. I think it all started after losing my dad to pancreatic cancer when he was 53. I wasn't like this at first. In fact it wasn't until my daughter was born about 6 years later that I started worrying. First about her, then as she got older I started worrying about her losing me. Last December my cousin died of ovarian cancer at 50. That hasn't helped. I feel like I'm barely living, just waiting for that diagnosis of cancer that is inevitable. I try to tell myself that worrying will change Nothing and just make everything worse. But that never works. So anyways, If you'd like to share your story with me, weather or not you have overcome this crippling thing, I'd be happy to talk about it with you."
"I have dealt with anxiety my entire life, however it became worse after my dad's sudden death at 23. Then, at 27, I started drinking ice coffee regularly and by 30 I was drinking a large latte every day. I'm 37 now, and within the past 10 years my anxiety has spun out of control. I am prescribed Zoloft and Wellbutrin. Last week, I cut out the lattes. The next few days were rough with fatigue and constant headaches. However, the past couple days I have felt great- not completely free of anxiety but not the usual heightened feeling or headaches.
  
 

  Has anyone else cut out caffeine, which then significantly impacted their anxiety in a positive way? I'd love to hear some of your experiences. Just looking for some relief."
"My brain makes me think about death almost daily. Mostly at night, when I'm in bed. Sometimes even in my dreams.
  
 

  Sometimes I think about my loved ones dying, other times it is about myself. I just can't deal with the fact that we're all going to die. Sooner or later. But everyday takes me closer to it, that is fore sure. Everyday that I'm living, the chance of dying is a little greater. I feel like my heart might stop beating any second now, even though there is no evidence yet that it will.
  
 

  I'm 36 right now, so still relatively young. But shit might hit the fan at any age. And the older I get, and my loved ones, the bigger the chance that it is going to happen.
  
 

  I'm not afraid of being dead. I am however, very afraid, of dying. Becoming ill. And having to say goodbye to my parents, wife, friends or kids. Whoever dies first. And in what order.
  
 

  I have this for a long time and it isn't getting any better. I know that I can't change anything about it. Just try to live healthy and try to think about something else. I know. But my brain plays tricks on me and, especially at night, my subconsiousness brings it back up.
  
 

  How the fuck are we supposed to deal with being aware of the fact that we are all going to die. And it probably won't be pleasant.
  
 

  What helps you guys?"
"Hi everyone I’m 37M I’ve just signed up to this sub, I have what I feel is an extreme case of SA. 
  
 

  Since my mid to late 20s I have been having attacks mainly at large gatherings of people or anywhere where some or all eyes are on me I will start shaking uncontrollably, starting from hands then to my entire body. I’ve noticed when I’m angry or scared I have an attack instantly and shaking begins. These attacks have also been happening at the barbers and until about February of this year anytime I needed to go to a social gathering or barbers I would make sure I drink alcohol to stop it. And it did help and the symptoms were greatly reduced but I am now sober after realising I have a massive drink problem with frequent blackouts and doing stupid shit. 
  
 

  I have tried to seek help before and was prescribed Xanax which at the time I felt was a miracle drug I was in shock and awe at this drug. After a while of using this drug I was no longer able to. 
  
 

  I need advice and ways to combat this condition without relying on anything such as alcohol or Xanax. 
  
 

  I have read some books on the condition and have a small understanding of the condition but no real solutions.
  
 

  Thanks for reading"
"Hey,
  
 

  I can't exercise. If I do some HIIT or running I am getting bunch of symptoms like dizziness I can't concentrate I have anxiety and my mind is jumping all over I'm getting thoughts that I will die etc. How to relearn my stupid brain that exercises are not dangerous? I did all the checks doctors told me I am healthy and can exercise. Yesterday I was on cycling tour with my gf we did 20 miles and near our home I got micro panic attack and thoughts that my heart will stop. It's so annoyed. I see people in the part running I want to do the same. I did jogging 3 years ago 3 times per week 3.5 miles but once got panic attack and then stopped."
So today I did research on Twitter about COVID many papers about damage to heart CNS etc. I got COVID in December and now I think I will die from post COVID symptoms like clots heart attack etc. Damn I hate my anxiety :(
"One of the ways my anxiety manifests itself is through physical pain and constant worrying about death or serious illness. 
  Today I’ve woken up with a headache, pain in my neck and jaw, pain in my lower lungs when I breath and back and upper leg pain. 
  It’s not always as severe as this but how can I feel better?"
[removed]
"So i've been dealing with anxiety and panic disorder since August when I had (out of nowhere) my first of 3 panic attacks. Since mid August i've felt off, not myself, anxious etc etc. 
  
 

  I went to a bunch of doctors (not realizing what I had was a panic attack/anxiety) primary care Dr for blood work, ent thinking something in my inner ear was making me feel off, optometrist thinking something was wrong with my eyes cause my off feeling, and last a cardiologist for a ekg/echo and stress test. Everything checked out fine.
  
 

  Fast forward to January when I had my second panic attack followed by another in February. 
  
 

  I went to a psychiatrist last week and we started effexor which I'm excited about. I just want to feel normal again.
  
 

  My question for this community, one of the symptoms i've been feeling from the beginning and continue to is like a feeling of hyper visual stimulation. Sitting in my house I'm fine, but when I get outside and start moving around, or bouncing around in a car, or trees/building go whizzing by it almost feels surreal. Almost like a hyper sensation of sight. Did/does anyone else feel this? The best way I can describe it is it feels like you had a beer or two, your not drunk but you feel something.
  
 

  Anybody? Any input would be awesome.
  
 

  Started effexor Thurs morning 37.5mg for 5 days, then 75mg till my follow up in 2 weeks.
  
 

  Thanks for any input/insight if anyone else felt like I did."
"I I’m (M42) who struggles with periods of debilitating anxiety and fear. Currently my wife and I are scheduled to go across country to see her sister and new niece. Issue is that I have immense fear that I’ll have a panic attack either A. On the plane B. While I’m there or C. All the above. 
  Flip side is that my wife knows about my panic stuff and is completely ok with me not going. 
  Here’s where the irrational comes in. I’m stupid nervous to go and just as nervous to stay at the house by myself. 
  I’m not always this way. But currently this bout of anxiety is tough."
"Well a few days ago I had a good amount of laundry to do and I realized I overloaded the washer and was also tired and needed to go to bed also was smoking weed trying to relax...
  
 

  I took out like 1/2 of the laundry and didn’t know what to do so I put it on a piece of cardboard and a plastic bag (not sure WTF I was doing) and went to bed 
  
 

  
 

  So now I remembered the leftover laundry and quickly went down and threw that damp laundry in the wash.... cold basement etc. I worried if the laundry could’ve developed mold? IDK also smoke cigs and I noticed my throat felt weird but it could be cotton mouth?
  
 

  I’m overthinking? Sorry this is kinda embarrassing..."
Is it normal for a 42 year old man to play FPS video games like call of duty Far cry etc.. I used to play these as a kid and I still absolutely love thrm...just don't know if it's normal at my age
"Weed-related I guess... may quit for a bit or just smoke CBD
  
 

  IDK been having anxiety in general too but today I noticed I thought I was like short of breath also my lungs felt weird? IDK but I also smoke cig and I noticed my silicone pipe is dirty... and makes me cough oof 😕
  
 

  I guess I worried something was wrong with me"
"So you smokers probably know those little glass bowls in like a silicone pipe? I accidentally dropped mine in the bathroom and rinsed with ISO then rinsed with hot water to clean.
  
 

  Maybe I’m being paranoid but I had an intrusive thought like:
  
 

  &gt; what if I didn’t wash the bowl well enough and smoked ISO?
  
 

  I think my mind is thinking of ways to scare me right??
  
 

  Should probably take a break..."
"Intrusive thoughts suck... and they are constant with us
  
 

  After breathing what do I do?? To feel better"
"Obvious worry is the doc freaking out and sending me to the psychiatric ward....
  
 

  Will I be understood? Is there a med that’s more effective than SSRI but not as addictive as Benzo?"
"Hear me out I know this sounds really silly but I was closing at work and mopping the floors and I noticed this little red piece on the floor. Looked like a piece of candy or something.... ya know those holiday cinnamon red candies that people make? Like one of
  Those.
  
 

  Well… I already swept earlier and just thought nothing of it and picked it up and threw it in the trash.… Now at that point I didn’t know if it was hard or soft. Whatever lol... yep it was hard. Then I worried if it was a drug or f*ntanyl or m*th or something? I thought my arm felt weird but I could honestly be trippin cuz I been anxious almost all day
  
 

  I’m also tired cuz sleep schedule has been messed up"
"Well I had some Hoastess chocolate donuts and I thought I noticed a couple specs of white and worried if they were mold but was confused as they have preservatives and maybe I ate a tiny bit of the white powder??
  
 

  Maybe I’m just tired and tripping lol.... anxiety lately"
"Another day of feeling completely useless and unable to accurately explain why. Another day of feeling all of my wasted potential going down the drain and being unable to stop it, because I have no fucking motivation left. Another day of irritability, anxiety, and frustration because I can't talk to anyone about this. Every time I do, I get nothing of value in return. I really hate this. I have no damn reason to be so depressed and yet, here I am. Hiding in the bathroom at work, because I have no fucking idea what to do and no damn desire to do anything."
"She told me kissing me wasn't worth it. She said she won't be able to give me a family I wanted so what's the point. She could have been discussing the weather. 
  
 

  She then in the same breath asked me to help her with a presentation. 
  
 

  She is a doctor. Makes 4 times more then I do. She is accustomed to getting her way. Saying things without consequences. 
  
 

  Not this time. Not with me. 
  
 

  I stood up. Told her she needs to reevaluate her wants in life and I'm going to give her her space. 
  
 

  I left. She messaged me. She wanted me to go on a trip with her. She said she was willing to pay.
  
 

  I asked her ""what's the point?"". 
  
 

  Before meds I would have been at her beck and call. I would have been in shambles. I would have given her opportunities time and time again. 
  
 

  I will miss her mother. I will miss her dogs. I won't miss being treated that way. I am saddened that I'm alone again. But I'm effin proud that I drew my line in the sand and refused to budge. 
  
 

  If you have the opportunity to seek help, use meds etc please do so. The power and self worth that comes with less anxiety is amazing.
  
 

  Edit: I am overwhelmed by the support I've seen in this post. Thank you all for your comments and PMs. The rewards were also lovely. 
  
 

  Your comments have helped me more then you know. Thank you for your support!"
"I hope.... yikes. IDK I know intrusive thoughts are normal and I think I have OCD... they are repetitive...
  
 

  How can I get past these thoughts?? One about harming friend.... I don’t want to lol.
  
 

  Sigh..."
"Err yeah violent intrusive thoughts which obviously give me anxiety ....
  
 

  
 

  100% I have GAD 99% I have OCD....
  
 

  Sounded like they were worrying about me being a killer? Like I’m not a danger to anyone right...? Don’t listen to them?"
"Why do we have the weirdest thoughts....
  
 

  
 

  And then fear of going crazy 
  
 

  
 

  And then we have weirdest thoughts of us doing weird harmful shit
  
 

  I don’t get it 
  
 

  Simple anxiety was bad enough this is hell
  
 

  Had some disturbing images - not sure how people just say “oh they don’t mean anything” yet we have the scary thoughts again and again cuz our brains are messed up"
"Like I was chilling in my buddy’s garage and I spat into a trash can that had an oil container in it, and ya know those times you spit and it seems like the spit doesn’t release and just kinda hangs there? I worried if I could’ve potentially somehow gotten oil residue. 
  
 

  Now it wasn’t something like a 9/10 anxiety but it was like a 3 and I still feel kinda.... dumb? Friend said I was paranoid and said don’t worry about it 😔
  
 

  Starting meds in a few days...."
"I (42F) moved from India to US in 2017 with my husband and kids (9 year old now). I didn't drive in India, but life is comfortable in India even if one doesn't know how to drive. I have been so afraid of driving most of my adult life and I avoided learning to drive until Nov 2021. My husband had to make a lot of adjustments to his schedule because of this; as anyone with kids would know, this meant planning all the kids' activities to be either at a walkable distance or to have a drop/pickup schedule that would work for my husband.  
  
 

  He would sometimes have a meeting or get-together that he couldn't avoid and I would use Uber/Lyft in such circumstances. On one such occasion in November last year, my kids and I got stranded for about an hour after a swim class as there were no available drivers and my husband was stuck in an important meeting far away. This helplessness impacted me deeply that day and I felt embarrassed and ashamed that I was putting my kids through so much trouble due to my inability to drive. I resolved to get a learner's permit and go for driving lessons, which I did. 
  
 

  Believe me, it was a huge struggle to face my fear head on, but I used to remind myself about that day when my kids waited for a long time in cold weather and pushed myself to learn to drive. I made sure that I practiced almost everyday in our car with my husband in the passenger's seat too. It took 15-20 lessons at the driving school and a lot of practice in our car; I passed the driving test and got the driving license in January of this year.
  
 

  To say that it is liberating is an understatement. Though I was anxious to drive alone, I tried to tackle one day at a time and build my confidence. For almost 3 months now, I have been dropping and picking up my kids for their school and activities, doing grocery/other shopping as necessary. I have tried to build my confidence on Freeways too and I can say I am fairly confident of driving in suburbs and freeways. 
  
 

  What I am not much confident about is parking in covered/basement parking lots or downtowns or when I see too many cars and too less wiggle room for any mistake. I am anxious about this aspect still but I used to calm myself that I don't need to do it everyday and I will learn to do it better when a need arises.
  
 

  And I had to do it yesterday and failed at it. I drove my kids to a soccer practice at a park, it is my first time being there and I didn't realize there are easier parking spots down the road. There was only one parking spot left where the map took me and I tried to fit my car in between two huge vehicles and I was terrified that I would nick either one of those. I tried backing up and going forward repeatedly and it was nerve-wracking for me. So, I decided to leave it the way I parked at a slight angle, drop my kids at the field (it is within line of sight of the parking spot), calm down myself and get back to the car and find a different parking spot.
  
 

  The car wasn't obstructing any other cars except I parked it at a weird angle and it looked closer to the car on the right. I heard a guy asking me from the other side of the lot ""are you going to leave your car like that?"", I told him that my kids are late, I will take them to the coach and get back to the car immediately to correct it. And he said ""you drive like shit"". I couldn't hear what he said the first time and I asked him to say it again thinking in my mind that he was suggesting something and I couldn't hear it. He said ""I said you drive like shit""! My kids were standing right next to me and I had to muster all my courage to not break into tears in front of them. My mind just went blank and I could just respond with ""ok"" and walk. This guy's comment shattered my confidence that I have been trying so hard to build up for the last 3 months. I have been feeling so down and low after this rude encounter and that doubt of whether I am capable of driving is creeping up on me. It also affected me that my kids brought up this guy's comment on our ride back home and they said they were upset that the guy said such a mean comment as my kids witnessed how hard I tried to learn to drive and they said that they were thinking about this throughout their practice and wondered why I didn't respond to him more except a ""ok"". Little did they know that I felt such a blow to my confidence!
  
 

  I dropped my kids at the practice, got back to my car immediately, took my time in backing up and parked my car in a different spot. But, that comment is haunting me. I am feeling more anxious if this is how it is going to be if I ever have to park in a crowded and difficult parking lot. I have been trying to reassure myself that I have been able to handle it for the last 3 months and this is a one-off thing, but, I can't shake off the feeling of ""what if it is true that I am a shitty driver"". What happens when I have to park like this again? 
  
 

  I hope I don't let down myself and my kids but that comment is so hard-hitting and unforgettable given the mental effort I had to put in everyday to just be able to drive. 
  
 

  I had to vent here to try and retain my confidence and my newfound freedom."
"Well to be honest it’s a long story and anyone know has seen my posts knows I’m anxious and I was stressed, and between anxiety and other stuff I was having some intrusive thoughts about various things.... wacky 
  
 

  And they scared me and I fundamentally know we aren’t our thoughts but I was still scared. I have access to anxiety medication but I gotta pick it up at the pharmacy.
  
 

  I guess I feel guilty cuz of the intrusive thoughts and I worried about psychosis but I’m pretty sure I’m just anxious, I’m still in control of myself and my actions... and was just really anxious? I’ve been drinking herbal tea trying to calm down and gonna take a shower.... diagnosed GAD but pretty sure I also have OCD
  
 

  
 

  I feel silly cuz I could’ve gotten on meds months ago but didn’t, damn 
  
 

  Also usually the weed helps but honestly I’ve been self-medicating and it I should probably take a break until my anxiety is under control...
  
 

  Hi I calmed down but just wanted to seek your thoughts?"
"I'm 48.
  
 

  I have what I call 'high functioning' social anxiety. 
  
 

  I've learned how to socialise, but the underlying anxiety has never gone away. My wife thinks ""I don't have it any more"". But I still do. It has never gone away. I feel bad about a few old friends I lost contact with because of it.
  
 

  Should I reach out to my past friends, explain my problem, and ask to reconnect?
  
 

  I feel I should. Or at least, offer an explanation."
"Did I give myself ERP years ago??
  
 

  I think I did... when I was 18 I had a pretty bad fear of gay stuff lol, which lasted for maybe 4-6 months IDK. I remember I eventually agreed with my thoughts and I got over the obsession.
  
 

  
 

  I had a harm obsession a few years ago and I remember I eventually agreed with my thoughts there too “I’m going crazy!” and the thoughts eventually stopped bothering me....
  
 

  Maybe I can do it again? Lol"
"Hi I think I’m okay but wanted to check in...
  
 

  I was cleaning some shelves at work and washed my hands, and went out for a smoke. Had a stomach ache but I could just be hungry....? Didn’t eat much besides some cereal and chips and it’s evening time lol
  
 

  My mind being overactive again?? Maybe I was worried about residue I guess lol"
"Well we unfortunately have mice and been trapping a few but I dropped my phone where the mice have been tho no mouse shit.... then I remembered no Lysol wipes...

Just weird and pretty sure I’m sane lol
"Hi,
  I have always been concerned about not being normal because I have anxiety.
  I realize that everyday is a struggle to survive, to be mostly fine, fearing so many things. I am so tired of feeling like this. I wonder: will I ever feel normal ? Not being afraid and just live. 
  Thank you for reading 🙏🏻"
Was feeling fine today and I smoked a cig (I know I know) and I couldn’t remember if I washed my hands before or after touching something like greasy? Like earlier I remember wiping some WD40 off my hands lol... just a bit. I think I’m good but overthinking? Was fine otherwise lol sorry
"I woke up feeling fine earlier was tired... drank a lot of coffee and no water
  
 

  Get home drink a few sips of water and take a nap. Woke up with dryish throat 
  
 

  This dude was coughing at work tho (not coworker) and I was gonna ask him to cover his damn mouth 
  
 

  Could he have gotten me sick?? Unless I need more water??"

"Been having some off and on anxiety tonite and this old school hippie gave me a roach (kinda used joint, in the weed community) and I’m like; cool.
  
 

  I take a hit and it tasted like ass. Extinguished it, and put it away. Breathing now... i looked inside the joint paper and it was like brown and I worried if the joint was old/moldy also smoked some ‘okay’ weed I think I’m okay? I hope? Just anxious and like WTF"
"I'm not sure if its a problem with my thinking. But it's difficult for me to make friends and acquaintances. It's not that I don't want to. When I'm approaching someone I feel they may not respond and I will be embarrassed. When they do not respond openly I feel hurt and that stops me from continuing further. I'm not sure if people sense I'm needy or whatever that is. 
  The situation is abysmal when approaching women.
  Is it an issue with self esteem ?"

"Lately IDK I’ve been washing my hands thoroughly after using the bathroom maybe I have a fear of contamination…
  
 

  I smoked some stronger weed and was feeling okay then I wondered if I washed my hands well enough like if there was any soap residue? lol silly fear right?
  
 

  Then I remembered the other day I think I got some mop water on my sweat shirt and IDK where specifically but I was kinda worried cuz a bud touched my sweatshirt and I smoked it anyway? I think I’m just being paranoid lol 😕
  
 

  Probably okay gonna drink some water sorry…"
"Stupid health anxiety ?? Sorry 😕
  We’re at my friend’s who’s other friends have been known to do drugs… he doesn’t really hang out with that guy anymore. 
  
 

  Basically I dropped a piece of candy on the table and I remembered one of them did coke on a plate on the table because we stumbled upon the aftermath….
  
 

  I blew it off and atr. Don’t think there’s ever been any drugs in that spot but IDK?

  I'm a 41 (very soon turning 42) year old male. I have been married for 14 years. I have 4 kids. Eldest is 12 and youngest is 3. I work full time as an administrator in a warehouse. We have our own home and only recently moved house so we have a nice big mortgage to go along with that.
  
 

  My issue is, I always had seen myself getting into film. Always wanted to be a film maker. Problem was my grades were no good. I completed year 12 (here in Australia) but unfortunately I didn't take school as serious as what I should have. Saddest thing is, I still dream about film all the time. I can't seem to let it go no matter how hard I try...
  
 

  My lower than normal grades meant film school was out of the question but why should that have stopped me? Right!? Well, soon after high school I got a job in retail. Then myself and my 2 younger brothers decided to buy an investment property so I was forced to continue working that stupid job. We ended up selling it as soon as my middle brother got married and then I decided to marry shortly after he did.
  
 

  A little more about myself- my weight has always fluctuated. Younger I was always fat. I had man boobs so that was a fun times going to school swimming days. I also used to play junior football (AFL) so the 1 time it was a practice game at training and we had to split our group into 2- tops on and tops off. Guess which team I was on... I have had low self esteem my entire life because of the man boobs and no matter how low my weight gets, they never go.
  
 

  I don't really know where I am going with this post but I just wanted to put everything out here. I am 41. I have no skills in life for a different career. I an in a marriage where we both work full time and only see each other on Saturday and Sunday. I hate visiting people as I get anxious and extremely self conscious as to what people are thinking of my appearance. I'm embarrassed to go swimming with my kids over my body issues and I really am not happy in life at the moment. I do love my wife but I hardly see her. I have 4 kids and only really feel like a taxi driver picking them up from school or dropping them off to where they need to go.
  
 

  Basically I feel like I'm just going through the motions in life without actually achieving anything meaningful. I so desperately want to go to school to try get into psychology but even the online courses wouldn't allow me enough time with full time work and looking after my kids after work. I feel trapped and lost and helpless.
  
 

  This is not a cry for help but maybe just a cautionary tale for anyone thinking they can wait and it will come to them. It won't. If you leave things for too long they will pass you by. If you don't go for ""it"" then ""it"" won't come for you so make sure you are 100% certain that whatever you do in life you are doing because you WANT to do it, not cause someone else thinks it's the right thing to do.
  
 

  Life is far too short to not do what you truly want. I feel like my time is now gone to do what I truly wanted (film) and now it's to go for the next best thing and see what happens from there."
"Again, I'll preface this by stating that I'm waiting for my insurance benefits to kick in, so I can seek our therapy/medication. I'm no stranger to seeking help, but in the meantime I'm happy to get advice.
  
 

  Long story short, I've been trying to limit my time on social media because it's all just bad news and depressing reality. I'm trying to avoid engaging with trolls and just focusing on aspects of the internet devoted to the things I like. Unfortunately, I don't enjoy things like I used to, most of the things I like end up reminding me of the bullshit I'd rather ignore, and I don't have anyone in my IRL life to talk to, so I can't really find a community to be a part of, unless I go online.
  
 

  So, if I am avoiding the internet, not following the news, and essentially not interacting with people, I end up alone and miserable. How do I not end up depressed? What gives the rest of you hope, especially when the world is such a shit show? I just feel helpless and irrelevant. I don't really know how or where to find joy."
Was smoking weed and I blew the ashes outta the bowl and they blew on me and I was worried about the Liklihood of getting something in my eye?? Like ash but I wear glasses? :( 😅😅
Hi I know this sounds dumb I smoked a fair amount of weed and have a fear of getting shocked and I touched a wall outlet but not the inside but the outlet itself…?? It’s kind of exposed as there’s no plastic panel cover I guess? But no exposed wires but fear of dying? IDK? IDK if I even got shocked?
"Hello everyone --
  
 

  I've been shy, introverted since I started high school (I'm 42 years old now!). Whenever I was in a social situation (primarily with strangers or with public speaking), I'd get nervous, tense up, sweat above my lip, have a racing mind, etc. 
  
 

  I've since worked really hard to become more extroverted and have really come out of my shell over the last 20 years. It really takes a long time and I'm still more comfortable being introverted. 
  
 

  I credit my job in a hospital as we're constantly having to speak to people on a regular basis, and to a lot of strong personalities. 
  
 

  Regardless, despite me actually wanting to speak to new people now and being accepting of them speaking to me - my body still reacts in the way it used to. It's like an old physical feedback loop I can't seem to get rid of!
  
 

  By the end of a 12 hour shift of constantly talking to people I'm beyond exhausted and my nervous system has taken a beating.
  
 

  Lifestyle wise I exercise, eat well, TRY and sleep well (I'm a super light sleeper), and meditate/do breathing exercises daily, as well do art/music as a hobby.
  
 

  I'm wondering if anyone else experiences this and if they've managed to conquer the physical symptoms that remain?
  
 

  Thank you!"
"Hello, I am 48 and I feel like I’m going crazy with the panic attacks.

I know this sounds dumb lol but I ogres a piece of bacon from a few days ago in the trash and opened a pack of smokes next to the van and worried about uhh if there could be bad meat uhh particles on my cigarettes?? Sorry lol probably overthinking
"Hello, I have been having extreme anxiety/ panic attacks and I’m tired . I have extreme fatigue and I was prescribed this. I have low estrogen and I’m 48 and my periods have been all over the place 
  So can anyone tell me if this helped their lives better. I’m tired of the panic and just wanting to stay in bed 
  
 

  The brand is Trintellix ( Vortioxetine)"
"I walked by a bottle of windex and somehow I worried about getting some in me 😔😔 IDK

"I’m pretty sure I’m okay lol but my hand felt weird I have a fear of getting shocked and there was a massive raindrops on my phone? Breathing now… thanks sorry needed to vent I’m pretty sure I’m okay…
  
 

  
 

  Also breathing is automatic? I don’t know how long I held my breath just now but I’m probably overthinking it…. And I didn’t pass out…. Which is what I heard about? :("
"Anyone deal w/ profuse sweating in social situations? I've always been a heavy sweater so I guess it makes sense that this would be my response in a situation that makes me anxious and where leaving would be socially awkward and/or unprofessional (meetings, interviews, etc.). I've been able to manage it with anticholinergics but they have to be taken 2 hours in advance (on empty stomach) of whatever situation I perceive might be a trigger, and they have annoying side effects (dry throat, mouth, eye, skin - basically they dry you out by stopping you from sweating). I'm 44 and been dealing with this as far back as I can remember. I recall being in 6th grade and being made fun of about my excessive sweating after a hot afternoon skate boarding in an after school skateboarding club. I was waiting for the bus and an older student took the opportunity to berate me and make me feel awful about myself. I feel like it's haunted me ever since and I'm at a point where I'd like to not have to rely on pills that dry me out and wondering if anyone has had good experience with CBT and/or exposure therapy to help manage this type of thing?"
"I'm pretty sure I'm just not going to pay them. They can't arrest us all, right? I'm freaking out a little though."
"Uh ohh…. I work retail and thought he might’ve been a loud guy I guess but his speech was a little slurred…. But he didn’t stumble or fall or anything
  
 

  If he gets in an accident can I really be held responsible? wtf?
  
 

  But I’m not responsible for others actions"
Sigh I had a weird fear of my drink being poisoned but….? I’m at work and kinda ridiculous but fear of dying
Hi F49 I have this fear of deep water in the pool I can't swim but want to enjoy it with my partner but too scared to go into the pool as my anxiety is really bad and think am going to drown I really do panic that I get so overwhelmed. I can go in the jakussi but I don't want to go in the children's pool.
"IDK my light in the basement doesn’t have a cover and I touched the switch maybe 15m ago and my arms feel weird but I don’t think I got shocked and maybe I’m just really high + I have a fear of dying 
  
 

  Anxiety sensations?"
"I was just at a graduation party for my best friend from childhood’s child. Thankfully my son went with me and we had a great time with each other. Now back at home I have all of these things I’d love to say/text to my friend, but I won’t. I wish I could text blindly to someone who have the “right” responses. So tonight Reddit, it is you. Thanks!"
I grabbed a soda from a gas station and it might’ve fallen over in the cooler IDK but it sat for like 45m outside and I opened it and took a sip but I worried the cap didn’t ‘click’ but was probably overthinking right?? Drank an hour ago IDK weird fear of being poisoned or dying
"Okay, here we go:
  
 

  I've always been anxious. I didn't even know I was anxious until a few years ago, when a friend who was diagnosed with GAD said I was worse than him. Whoops.
  
 

  I could give you lifetime of examples, but I think a couple of the strongest are that when I was a child, if my mom was late home from work, my sister would tell me she was dead and I'd be a hysterical crying mess. 
  In my teenage years, I struggled with White-coat syndrome, and would tank test scores because of my anxiety. As such was always disinterested and bored in school.
  In my adult life, every time I try to be sexually intimate with a women, my equipment doesn't work. This has lead to a downward spiral and self-fulfilling prophecy I haven't been able to work around.
  My marriage is failing due to my constant needs for re-assurance and my work is suffering because as I work in a high stress environment where I need to think fast and I'm often bogged down in choice paralasys, I often second guess myself and basically think I'm an impostor here. 
  I have another lengthy post about my issues, if anyones interested. 
  
 

  I've been to therapists and they just... don't seem to offer much, they just listen then sort of don't really know what to say? I've been offered medication, but I've heard some real horror stories about side-effects. 
  
 

  I just wish I knew what was wrong with me. Why don't I want anything? Who doesn't want anything? I just want to lie on the floor and not get up (nothing suicidal, literally just lie on the floor).
  
 

  Any insight is appreciated."

"Coping skills are absolutely key to improving an anxiety sufferer's quality of life. As someone who has dealt with perpetual anxiety for over 30 years, I've been through the ringer and can tell you that your son will get better. The biggest CBT method that helps me is to utterly and completely give in to the initial panic or fear. This may seem counterintuitive, and the mind will fight you on it, but it is necessary to train the brain to understand that you are not going to die and you definetely aren't going crazy.
  
 

  Lol, it took me years to accept this. You can't think yourself crazy. It is physiologically impossible. And you're right, the second most important aspect of CBT is to BE KIND TO YOURSELF. Unwanted thoughts will pop up. Acknowledge them. Embrace them. Let them go. They will become fewer and more manageable.
  
 

  I am 50 years old and starting suffering from generalized anxiety disorder at the age of 18. 
  
 

  I am a college graduate. I have written several novels, screenplays and other freelance online content.
  
 

  I have a wonderful wife of 23 years and two beautiful kids aged 21 and 19. 
  
 

  I hope you and your son know that a great life is possible for us. Especially now, with new medications coming out all the time.
  
 

  Prayers that you both find peace."
"I have seen a significant improvement in my anxiety levels over the last month. So much so that I feel a level of discomfort in it's absence. 
  
 

  Has anybody experienced this? I imagine it will lessen over time."
"Hello all,
  
 

  I have suffer with GAD for 20 years. 4 months ago I moved back to my home state and I've been struggling with up tick in anxiety. I've also found myself more sedentary then normal. My doc had me wear a heart monitor for a month and everything looked fantastic he said. That is however when he discovered i do in fact have a low resting heart rate. I brought this up to him before hand as I got into a constant self checking with pulse ox, blood pressure, blood sugar and of course self scanning.. ugh.
  
 

  My heart rate gets in the 40-50BPM when sleeping and 50-60BPM when on the couch. On walks 80-110BPM range.
  
 

  I'm 6'6 260lbs and rocking the dad bod.. 
  
 

  So the 20 some years started with Panic and Anxiety attacks with your typical symptoms and the biggest fear was my heart rate racing. Over the years I learned how to que into my body and notice i was about to have an attack and would focus on my breathing to calm myself before the storm. This I think is how My low heart rate may have started.. Now that I'm super focused on my body sensations (Hyperawareness) with vigilant self scanning and using all these devices to check myself evolved. I believe i might have wired myself to relax more then normal.. Example, Sitting on the couch and pulse ox says oxygen is 94% and heart rate is 70BPM something trigger me to start breathing deeper and slower and in turn this brings Oxygen back up to 100% and heart rate down to 55BPM. This use to be more of a struggle and now it just naturally happens.. 
  
 

  I've had every test under the sun done from blood tests like CBC, minerals, thyroid, glucose, lipid and many MANY more. Cardiologist.. echo, stress, ultrasounds, MRI, CT and in the end everything has come back normal. 
  
 

  I have just realized I think this turned into a vent session. Apologies 
  
 

  Feel free to comment or suggest."
"Hi, I'm a first time poster here. \*Trigger Warning\*
  
 

  I’m (m43) married to a wonderful wife (f44) and we have 3 amazing kids 3M, 6M, 10F. We’ve been married for almost 11 years and dated for 2 prior. I was always the sole provider when she wasn’t pregnant. She did contract work as a therapist (LCSW for 15+ yrs) which has super flexible hours. During the pandemic I became burned out. We were in a different state and ended up buying a home in a different state. We switched roles, and the move cross country was a lot, but we managed. She’s now working full time. 
  
 

  My wife grew up in an abusive household, which was a household of 5. She’s estranged from her father who lives out of state somewhere. Recently, within the last 18mos she has also become estranged from her older sister who lives in our city. We had a very specific incident in August ‘20 where it all came together for her. Her younger brother is severely handicapped and there has been little relation between him and either sibling. Her mother passed away years ago from cancer, but was emotionally abusive. Her father was more physically abusive. When her mom passed, her aunst (mother's sister) helped raise them. She's a wonderful person to a fault. Recently (within the last month), this relationship took a turn itself. She's co-dependent herself and does not set boundaries. 
  
 

  Over time, as she’s been dealing with these issues she’s used that to help heal herself. It’s been very impressive. She sought therapy when she was an undergrad, and those therapists helped her see and directionally pointed her to the characteristics her parents display of narcissism and personality disorders. 
  
 

  My wife suffers from anxiety, which I've known about, but I don’t know the specific type. Just a couple days ago she told me she woke up feeling sh\*tty and there’s a noticeable change in the way she interacts as I’m sure many here can imagine. She withdraws herself from everything. She also becomes overwhelmed more easily. Remember she’s working, and she musters up the energy to get to work. When she gets home, she’s exhausted. She’ll go straight to our room and change so she can get in bed. As our family has grown, it seems like this is happening more frequently.
  
 

  Meanwhile, I’m cleaning, cooking, dealing with homework, managing as much as I can over house projects, bills, appointments, taking the kids to practices etc. I’m the caregiver for our youngest and running around taking him to things during the day. As the kids have gotten older they’re becoming more independent, but the issues change. 
  
 

  Because of that, I run ragged throughout a given week. I’ve been looking to get back into the job market. It seems like it makes sense, because our income will increase, however…
  
 

  When my wife is feeling the anxiousness that happens for days on end, and we have a weekend and there’s downtime she goes into decluttering mode. Clutter makes it worse for her. Herein lies part of the problem. If I do actually get a job, it’ll mean I’ll have even less time to take care of things, which will lead to potentially more decluttering. When she is in this mode everything is terrible for her. Her temper is short with everyone, and nothing is right. I find myself dropping everything I’m doing so I can help her. She gets easily frustrated. When she’s using technology it always seems to break when she’s using it. So, it means that I do a lot for her. Ex. I set up the insurance, our mortgage payments, our house bills as her. The job that she got that moved us cross country, I did the application for her. I redid her resume for it. The running list of house/family related projects is years long and she expects me to take care of the majority of the list. Since then I’ve worked on coming up with a basic online list. She’s too overwhelmed to use it. 
  
 

  What I’m looking for is advice on being supportive during this time, and things I can do. I’m not a naturally organized person. I’m not hyper vigilant when it comes to cleaning. I try to do as much as I can. I’m not a slob, and it doesn’t bother me nearly as much as her. I have watched her family come apart over the years. It appears her relationship with her aunt might be in disrepair as well. 
  
 

  Should I be politely helping her get a therapist? Should I buck up and be more thorough to clean more? My field of work, there’s no “contract” work. Does getting a full time, w2 job make sense? I’m at a lost and trying to prevent becoming resentful towards her. The kids are starting to notice mom doesn't feel well all the time. 
  
 

  Thank you for your consideration and time."
"Uhh friend has a zippo lighter and uses lighter fluid and I worried I somehow got some on my hands and packed a bowl of weed and worried I tasted something??

  But I was overthinking cuz I had random health anxieties (germs) but I’m pretty sure I’ll be okay I think 😊
  
 

  I might have a weed issue and maybe my body is rejecting it :(

  Advice??"
"I struggle with people and their reactions, also messages addressed to me. 
  I'm currently in a phase of studying and shut out almost any other communication to people, because i realized it lets my stress levels rise to communicate. I am never sure how the other person reacts, I usually don't trust to be ""safe"", there's one friend I'm almost sure her reactions will be positive and reassuring (she still tells me what she thinks but it's never mean or outlashing). 
  But I always have phases where I'm just scared of people. I avoid seing my neighbors, I despise anyone invading my safe space in public (which can range from 2m to 50m distance depending on my mood). 
  I'm afraid to read emails and texts, open letters, answer the phone... So I often avoid it. Which just increases the anxiety because i don't know what is up in my life. 
  Today someone knocked on my door (i live in a building with multiple Appartements), left, knocked again, left, knocked again. I wasn't expecting anyone just hid in my apartment, didn't make any noise and froze, freaking out inside. I saw the guy looking up to my flat and i thing he saw me and made a gesture of wth. I didn't recognize this this guy but it freaked me the hell out. now I'm wondering about all those things I might not know (letters etc). 
  Does anyone else have similar experiences? 
  
 

  I have a therapist but i just recently came to the conclusion that what i sometimes feel could be fear and anxiety, so i haven't talked to her about it yet. But I thing it's not normal to have you heart racing and your stomach drop whenever someone is calling you, even a friend.. I'm afraid of things like them being mad, me making a mistake, them abandoning me, stuff like that. 
  And it's not like i never conquer my fear. many many times i overcome my fear and pick up or open the letter. but i is every effing time and that shit is exhausting!! so when there is something else going on in my life, I drop this extra exhaustion... idk 
  
 

  And i suspect where the roots to this are. my home was very unstable and i could not rely on the adults being there for me, i always had to expect grandma lashing out, my mom lying on the couch depressed and my dad got very sick at some point so my mom had to carr for him. idk, I've learned over the years (and good people, amazing friends and therapy) that people can be there and care. but feelings don't understand this. I'm the one that is a burden, that will be abandoned. and sometimes humans scare me and i just want to hide..."

"Does your art bring you enough joy and pride in your art to counter some aspects of SA? Has it affected your ability to promote/sell it? Or has it just prevented you from being able to share it with the world?
  
 

  I'm a 50M jewelry designer and metalsmith that has suffered with SA since high school, though I was able to carve out a place for myself in most of my life phases by focusing on various artforms starting with drawing, then on to photography and finally metalsmithing. Like others mention, as I've gotten older, my SA has gotten progressively worse, preventing me from promoting myself to the extent that I'd like to. And recently I found that my social anxiety got so bad that I had to leave my booth at my weekend markets and sit somewhere away from the crowds for 20-30 minutes and that got repeated a couple of more times per market. Luckily I have my wife in the booth with me and she is able to handle everything when it became too much for me.
  
 

  I have recently started a new SSRI, which has finally started working after being on it for a little over a month now. I have found that I'm actually able to stay in the booth the entire show, greet customers and carry on conversations with a few. I'm also finding that I can walk around the market and through the crowds without getting overly anxious. I don't feel like I'm out of the woods with my SA, but I do finally feel like I'm making progress with handling the aspects that affect my ability to show my work, discuss it and sell it."

  But, logically I know I wouldn’t (right?) think up these things or be so fearful willingly? I mean why would I? So I deduced they’re intrusive thoughts of paranoia right? Feel embarrassed to say and feel dumb to be worried about random BS when I’m just trying to chill"

"I'm 42 years old and I've struggled with social anxiety all of my life, but I've never sought help because I've basically just been good at avoiding it/navigating around it with the help of my wife. 
  
 

  Today I got a rude awakening regarding social anxiety because my wife is out of town and she had pre-planned to have some friends take our 9 year old son to a classmate's birthday party, but those plans fell apart at the last second and that put me in the hot seat to get our son to the party. The birthday child's parents were fine with me just dropping our son off because they are very sympathetic to my anxiety, but when I got there to drop off my son, he had his own anxiety about me leaving him there. I'm trying to be a good dad and I do not want my anxiety to deprive my child of joy. Unfortunately, I didn't foresee him being anxious about the situation, himself, so I didn't even think to get myself dressed for the party. I had him get back in the car and I agreed that I'd go home, get ready, and then we'd go back. 
  
 

  When I got home to get ready, I was paralyzed with anxiety and at the same time struggling with the guilt of not being able to get him to the party to be with his friends. To top it off, I realized that I didn't have any clean clothes, which just adds to the anxiety. If I'm being honest, the clothes are probably just fine, but I don't even like to answer the front door when the pizza guy comes if I'm wearing a shirt that I was wearing the day before. I broke down and started bawling. I've never experienced emotions this heavy over the anxiety, but this hit me hard. My son came to check on how close I was to getting ready and he saw me bawling. This made it even more hard because he then began saying that I could drop him off and that he'd be strong. I ended up taking him back and dropping him off almost an hour after the party started. 
  
 

  I don't want this life for my son. I want to be able to be there for him like all of the other ""normal"" parents are there for their kids at that party. I have to change this, but how?"
IDK tired and random anxiety I’m at work dealing with random customers IDK not sure how I’d be poisoned tho lol
"I just wanted to share about some relief I have gotten for my anxiety in hopes it helps someone. 
  
 

  Fyi - I am 44 years old and struggled my whole life with mental health. For the past year my mental health and anxiety has been so bad due to major events. I have been off work on medical leave for 10 months. Ive never been able to feel just not anxious. I have tried a lot of different daily meds and anxiety attack benzos. Nothing seems to help for the over all anxiety I live with. 
  
 

  Well, 3 weeks ago my amazing (new, been my dr for the past year) doctor prescribed me something I have never heard of, never stumbled upon via google or in any community convo. 
  
 

  I was prescribed Atarax (hydroxyzine). It is an antihistamine but used for sedation and anxiety in some cases. I take 25mg once per day. Unlike the warnings about the med it doesnt knock me out since I am at a lower dose. I tend to feel a little tired durring the day, but I am not anxious like before. Just wanted to toss that out there. Feel free to ask any questions. I can give you my independent experience as a person. Im not a dr or anything."

"I get so embarrassed when I get together with people that I know from my past when the eventual question of ""do you remember when we did this"" or ""do you remember that person who used to hang out with me."" This immediately sparks my SA as, 9 times out of 10, I don't have memories of those events or people and it becomes super awkward as I try my best to show some kind of recall to their question. I usually have super poor recall of most events, probably because the entire time I'm experiencing said events, I'm also anxious and stressed, though I do tend to recall negative events over positive ones. 
  
 

  There was an instance a few years ago where I had a MASSIVE panic attack (that may have been brought on by some prescription drug interactions, I'm not really sure.) One morning me and my wife were headed to meet her friend and family at a restaurant. On the drive there I started to have a PA like I've never had before, losing the ability to talk and move my limbs (to the point that thought I was having a stroke or something and would be 'locked in' for the rest of my life). After about thirty minutes I was finally able to recover and, about an hour later, I felt completely calm, with no anxiety and no care in the world. I was able to laugh and joke, and most interesting, my memory was SUPER sharp. I was able to recall long strings of numbers and remember various movie quotes so easily (which I usually SUCK at.) I didn't do lots of recalling past events and experiences, but I'm sure it would have been easier. This lasted for about 3 or 4 weeks, during which I, unfortunately, also had several mini panic attacks during each day, a sad comic joke to balance out the calm chill, anxiety free moments of the day I guess. After that 3rd week I slowly started to have more and more anxiety, until I reached my previous level and slowly forgot what it felt like to be anxiety free for long stretches of the day. 
  
 

  I don't know if this is a very rare occurrence, but it was a very interesting one that opened my eyes to how much my anxiety has a huge affect on my memory and it has, unfortunately, robbed me of so many of my memories. Hopefully going forward (now that I'm on an SSRI that seems to be working, along with CBT,) I can get a handle on my SA and make many positive memories going forward."

"Since 2008 I have been going through bad times
  I got married in 2008 and within a year I had anxiety and depression, we got seperated in 2014.
  My dad had heart trouble in 2013 and passed away in 2014. My mom nearly died in 2013 from heart disease and kept getting admitted to ICU for next 6 years before passing away in 2019. From 2014 to 2017 I had legal troubles with my wife as she had filed a false domestic violence case. I had to pay her a lot of money. We decided to end the court battle in 2017 but it did not work as I could not forget the past nad we got divorced in 2020. I still don't get complete access to my child. In 2017 I had severe anxiety OCD. I used to feel all the time I was psychotic and needed constant validation on my mental health and felt my wife would file divorce by reasons of insanity on me. 2019 was really bad as my mom was in hospitals all the time finally passed away later that year. Now it was just me and my sister.
  Last Monday my 34 yo sister had brain haemorrhage, luckily she is fine but some functions are affected
  
 

  This incident made me wonder is there something like bad spells and black magic. In my 42 years I have never believed in these.
  But it seems no matter what I do I can't get out of trouble. Maybe I'm overreacting. I have tried therapy.
  I can't get into relationships, see no future for me."
And sometimes it seems like all of their eye contact goes to my wife instead of me. Am I alone in this?
"Has anyone experienced high BP due to anxiety, if so how are you managing it"
"I am trying to start off my day with a short walk in the morning to get myself centered before starting the day. During my work day I'm being more mindful of how much I'm working and I am trying to take more short breaks to stretch and shift focus for a bit of I'm becoming to anxious about a project (I have SA with a comorbidity of general anxiety.) I generally try to listen to either distracting podcasts with humor (currently mostly Kitboga's livestreams on Twitch) or mindfulness and biohacking podcasts like 10% Happier and the Huberman Lab. I try to practice deep breathing as much as possible throughout the day (also just found a deep breathing app called Prana Breath that is an excellent guided breathing app) and also am mindful to breath through my nose as much as possible. I'm also trying to express more self love (not that kind) and allow myself to accept my flaws and be okay with them and not fall into an abyss of self hatred and shame like I'm generally prone to do when I make mistakes. I also take baby steps with my SA by slowly doing exposure therapy when I can (on Mondays I do the grocery shopping buy myself and it's gotten more manageable as I've slowly gotten accustomed to the store layout and with the help of my headphones and using the stores app to help me navigate to store to find an those hidden items that my wife wants because there are coupons for them. I was doing meditation but that lapsed. I do plan on resuming it though, just need to stop procrastinating (another thing I need to get under control. Finally, most importantly, for me at least, is that I have finally found an SSRI that (mostly) works for me. I've tried and quit many, but this one has given me the best results by a long shot. I have also started up weekly CBT online sessions again, which has been very beneficial as well. Anyway, sorry about the TED talk! Looking forward to hearing the little (and big) things that everyone does throughout the day to temper their SA."
"On days in which anxiety is worse, my voice gets hoarse and raspy. If I have a couple better days it goes back to close to normal. I haven’t had a completely normal voice since last august when this anxiety really blew up. My voice is so hoarse at times that I am mistaken for a woman frequently on the phone. I’m a guy. Many days I literally sound like The Godfather.
  
 

  Anyone out there experiencing changes in their voice when anxiety gets bad?"

"Hello to anyone that reads this! This may be a bit long, but I feel compelled to share this with others that may have in the past or are currently experiencing a different feeling. I'm 41 years old and recently had an experience while driving that has taken over my mind unfortunately. I would say that I have dealt with anxiety for pretty much my entire life. When I was in the 4th grade I had a seizure at school that nearly took my life. Thankfully I only had that one, but when I was younger I would often get anxiety about having another one. Any sensation in my body that didn't feel normal to me made me anxious of having another seizure. Most of the time the anxiety with this would come and I would feel like my normal self shorty thereafter. 
  
 

  Well what happened back in early August of this year is what brought me to share this. I was taking a family trip 5 hours away to visit some family members. This is a drive that I've been making since 2005, and I've never had any issues. Well this particular morning about 2 hours into the trip, I all of a sudden started feeling weird while driving. It was almost as if I was having an out of body experience and it honestly scared me. My mom was in the passenger seat next to me. She and I were having a conversation, and I could hear everything she was saying, but couldn't process it. It was a feeling that I never, ever had while driving. My heart was beating extremely fast, and I kept feeling the need to belch. I tried gaining control of my breathing, and everything was okay the rest of the trip. Coming back home I had no issues.
  
 

  However, after having this incident happen, I began to constantly worry about it happening again. Well this past Saturday, I took an hour drive to go see my sister. Once again I started getting in my head and had the same feeling that came over me back in August. It didn't last as long, but was still pretty scary. I reached the city where my sister lives and I was okay while I was driving around an area where there was constant stopping and going. Coming back home I had no issues. 
  
 

  Well since then, I cannot stop thinking about these two incidents, and it's truly annoying me. I feel like I cannot concentrate most of the time because I'm constantly overthinking. I will admit that it's gotten better the last two days, but I just want to feel like my normal self again. I want to be able to drive without worrying about having some kind of anxiety attack. I want to be able to go about my day without thinking about these things. I'm not looking for any diagnosis or anything, just wanted to share my story with others. I already feel myself feeling a bit better just writing this. I hope all is well with you all!"
"I have bipolar with severe anxiety and depression. I’m also an only child. Lost mom three years ago, 6 weeks after I kicked out my husband. I’ve been with my dad since.

"I am 43 years old and have spent my entire life dealing with crippling social anxiety. It negatively impacted my personal relationships, family connections, and professional life.
  
 

  I've always kind of denied my issues when asked but at my yearly checkup with my MD she asked if I have any other concerns and I brought up my anxiety. She suggested I try Sertraline (generic Zoloft). On some level I think I've always been a little been anti medication, thinking I need to just ""fix it myself"" because I was worried about side effects like personality change, etc...but this time I decided to listen to her and give it a try.
  
 

  My life has been immeasurably better over the last 10 months since I started.
  
 

  That gut-wrenching feeling of abject terror when faced with an uncertain social situation is gone, replaced with a general uncertainty that is so much more manageable. I just spent several weekends in a row with groups of people I had not previously met. These situations were all work-related, but instead of sneaking out of the ""encouraged but not technically required"" after-hours socialization, I chose to stay and socialize and actually enjoyed myself.
  
 

  My anxiety isn't like all the way gone, but where there was an instant feeling of white-hot panic that rendered me unable to speak or act like myself, now there's like a pause where I can consider the situation objectively and actually make conscious decisions rather than just immediately going into fight or flight mode.
  
 

  I'm not saying drugs are the answer for everyone, but if you're like I was and afraid to even ask or suggest you might need help, it's worth talking to your doctor about your issues if you can find the courage. I honestly didn't even know you could get ""brain drugs"" (as we call them in our house now) from a regular doctor. I thought you had to go to a Psychiatrist, but you don't!
  
 

  Good luck, friends. This SA thing is no joke. I just wanted to share one tool that's been very effective for me personally."
"5 days ago I (48m) had to have my appendix removed in emergency surgery and spent 4 days in hospital. I was sleeping then, but also hopped up on pain pills. Now I'm back home and slept an hour or so last night and tonight is looking rough. I took a couple sleeping pills but I think I am having anxiety about being so helpless. I take care of my wife hand and foot, and while she said she's happy to help I think this helplessness is causing my lack of sleep. Does this make sense?"
So I have a few friends that I’ve been able to make and keep close since high school (F42). So I reached out to them about a month ago to get together for my birthday. It sounded like it was a thing. So I doubled check today and really only one of them can. We’re changing to a different weekend and my family is going to take me hiking. Just needed to be sad for a minute. It’s all going to be good.
"I want to give a little background info before I explain what has been happening. I am 42 years old, and I got my first panic attack when I was around 26. That triggered many more over the years. They resulted in anything from self-soothing to being at the ER convinced I was dying. After tests and x-rays and cat scans, they would always end up saying I am fine, and it would be good enough to get back to normal for a while. If I was feeling bad 98% of the time, I could always drink some or beer and start to feel good as new.
  
 

  Well let's skip forward to recently. About 2.5 months ago. My cat was outside and there is this raggedy aggressive cat that comes around sometimes. He is huge and always seems to have wounds on him. I have called animal control and they have never been able to capture him. Well, the cat attacked my cat, and I broke them up and got bit in the process. I was a little worried about being bit but I tried to shrug it off. Approximately 5 weeks later we woke up and my cat was dead. Did not seem to have any visible wounds or trauma. He was just dead laying in a flower bed. He had his rabies shots as a kitten and was only 1 year old. I started to get quite anxious with thoughts that maybe he died from rabies. I felt no symptoms, so I shrugged it off again. Well 3 days after his death I woke up with a bad sore throat headache fever and coughing. Started feeling extreme anxiety. So, like an idiot I googled symptoms of rabies. Of course, it says all of those things plus anxiety are the symptoms for rabies. I got tunnel vision and went straight to the hospital. I told them my story and they basically just blew me off. They said I was positive for covid. So, I went home hoping that my symptoms would fade, and things would be alright. However, it never did get alright. My anxiety increased. Uncontrollable thoughts monitoring my headache, dizziness and even how much spit my mouth was making. Every once in a while, after being told I'm crazy by family, and 2 more ER visits with doctors who will not take me seriously. Here I am. My main symptoms are uncontrollable anxiety and a really cloudy dizzy head that hasn't gotten any better and it has been a month. I just have this impending sense of doom and that something isn't right. Sometimes I know I feel OK but the thought of not feeling OK makes me not feel OK. I have a boat load of klonopin and I take it, but it makes me all groggy and not able to function either. The crappy thing about rabies is it progresses so slowly and there really are no hospitals that will test you for it unless you are foaming at the mouth half dead. I feel like any time you go to the doctor, and you tell them you have anxiety they immediately dismiss any physical symptoms you have. I am hoping this is some sort of brain fog caused by covid that will eventually go away. It has been almost a month since I first got it though. I am scared to die and committing suicide is not a possibility at least at this point. However, I can understand why others do. I feel like I'm trapped in a burning building. Anyone ever had a similar situation? edit: I might add I have a wife and kids and I am also nervous they may have been infected. How do you guys deal with this when no one will take you seriously?"
"It was kind of mandatory, so I am not blaming myself too much, except for being naive about what would happen. Couldn't handle the hotel, the breakfast procedure sent me into dissociation, wouldn't understand the talks because of being in a constant terror, afraid of people, terrified of the unknown surrounding/country. Didn't sleep for two nights straight with relentless panic, had to knock myself out with medication during the third day, had to conceal my state before my colleagues, which made the panic even worse.
  
 

  This is all so hard. I can't take it anymore, I basically can't function except for in my own home. Was on sick leave for a whole week after coming back from the conference. Dreading work and the next relentless panic attack."
I am really nervous and anxious. I am going on holiday to the canaries in 9 weeks time with my elderly mum but I am worried about the flight with all this war and tension around the world with threats of nuclear war.

"I am 41 male hearing impaired from meningitis at birth. Have attention deficit disorder plus i was told I have a tiny bit of cerebral palsy although I was never diagnosed for it. I can somehow be ok most of the time when alone in my room or out riding my bike and feeding homeless cats. But if I have to get in the car even to go 5 minutes down the street, I feel like I have to use the bathroom really bad or I’ll mess on myself but I had just gone to the bathroom and didn’t have to go. Which is what i told brother. So brother tells me to get in the car for appointments etc. or simply going shopping at Walmart. I tell them repeatedly to let me out because I gotta go. There’s no bathrooms for xx minutes so I have no choice but to hold it as best as I can. Arrived, I run as fast as I can to bathroom but never had to go. I begged to go home. Brother says I do it every time but end up having no issues even being gone out with family for 3 hours. My sister in law taking me to psychiatrist soon to get me on medication but first she wants me to try therapy. But what will they do? I’d pray to God and ask him to take me to be with my mom or descend upon me to heal me but brother tells me not to ask for death because God will not give us something we cannot handle. Plus there are people with handicap worst than me but don’t ask to be taken to heaven. But it so aggravating annoying and embarrassing I cannot act like a normal person. It’s like I’m a headless chicken freaking out so i try to go to bed and get under the covers. and try to sleep it away, then eventually i fall asleep. hours later, i wake up fine.
  
 

  if there's nobody home, i'm fine in the morning watching tv, playing with cats and cat-friendly dogs and even watch tv in the living room
  
 

  as soon as i see a car pulling in the driveway, i start freaking out for some reason. ""timothy its your brother. calm the eff down"" but sometimes it doesnt work so i'd rush back to bed.
  
 

  if i MUST get in the car to go somewhere where NO is not an option, then i'm told several times to use the bathroom. then they ask if i'm done. i say i cannot go any more, ok, then get in the car, appointment or out to eat as a family. i say we have food at home. TIMOTHY! you need to get used to going out again, then whining the whole 15 minutes trying to just find a restaurant 5 minutes from the house, my brother drove PAST the Island Wings which is 6 miles from the house to the buffalo wings which is 10.8 miles.
  
 

  being quiet and looking out the window or playing on my phone, i am constantly feeling like i gotta go
  
 

  but when i throw my things in my bookbag, i use my bookbag like a purse, as mom used to say, and start talking about whatever, i eventually start to feel better
  
 

  but instead of being a motor mouth, i'd want to shut up and try to kinda enjoy the ride.
  
 

  nope. as soon as i shut up and stop talking, i immediately yell for them to let me out to use the bathroom. timothy! you were fine just now, we almost at buffalo. keep talking since being quiet doesnt work.
  
 

  arrived, we were immediately seated. no wait, and my available table happened to be the closest to bathroom, but didn't have to go, not even while eating, or right before leaving. everything closed around 11pm so we went home.
  
 

  3 hours later, and i still didn't have to use bathroom as we got home
  
 

  ""ok crybaby did you have an accident? are you fine? did you mess in your pants?""
  
 

  no, then like i said you've gone hundreds of times with no problems. you do this every time. and nobody knows if i'm doing on purpose or if my brain is wired that way
  
 

  before i moved to my new state, my sister and i would go visit mom for a week. 5 hours and no anxiety meds, i took a bottle of pepto bismol with me, and it kinda helped, so my sister's son and daughter in the backseat would remind me to drink another in x hours, but afetr arriving, mom said not to be using meds when i dont need it because when i do, it wouldnt work because my body would have built an immunity against it.
  
 

  the whole week, mom would try to get me to deal with my anxiety on my own, and sometimes i feel ok after a 20 minute tantrum.
  
 

  the day we go home, mom said she'll never inveite me back because i caused too much problems plus i told my sister to let me out. TIMOTHY! its your nerves sit down and shut up. but after still complaining too much, she's fed up and asked for pepto bismol and told her its in the trunk. she pulled over on the extressway to get it then had her kids to give it to me, then the 5 hour ride home, i was fine. stopped once to pee but other than that i was fine.
  
 

  BUT, i could ride public transit, [itsmarta.com](https://itsmarta.com), on buses and trains alone all day every day and have ZERO problems.
  
 

  so, its like it does this to my friends and family but not when i'm out by myself
  
 

  why? do i hate my friends and family that bad i dont realize it? but i enjoy my friends i have.  
  
 

  
 

  my siter in law mentioned agoraphobia, i dont think i have that though. i saw on Most Extreme that one day this woman's agoraphobia was so bad she NEVER stepped out of the bathroom, that the hospital had to come get her out.  
  
 

  
 

  i can go to my mailbox and play with my cats in the yard, i can go ride my bike for hours, i can feed homeless cats or even walk around walmart on my own, so, i dont think i have agoraphobia."
"I used to have severe SA as a kid. I was bullied, body shamed etc. abusive childhood too. Very little support from fam (mentally) and had no friends. 
  I committed suicide but failed. I shutdown for few years until 20. 
  
 

  Then came hostel/dorm living for my engineering degree. Found few could friends and exposure to people helped. I was insecure but better. I never felt adequate though. I never danced and public speaking was living hell. But one day from no where my brain flipped. Suddenly In 3rd year of college I became funny and was told I should be stand up. Still SA I never made the move. I should have….
  
 

  I am 49 now. I had gf’s, I have beautiful wife and 2 kids. I have a loving dog and job and properties in Silicon Valley. I have cars and I have friends. I am still SA. I don’t dance and I can’t sing ..😁recently got bummed by chronic disease 😁
  
 

  This days I crack jokes in small groups and make people laugh like hell. Yesterday I got feedback to not monopolize the conversation though and be a good listener so basically ppl now asking me to talk less 😅 go figure. I will work on being extrovert. 
  
 

  I come here often and read your stories. Here are my tips and lesson learned from almost 50 years of living on this planet. 
  
 

  - believe this
  
 

  _ everybody is just bull shitting their way through life and people are trying and doing their best. Nobody knows what future holds which means equal chance it will be wonderful. 
  - Nobody is really in control fully of their life fully ie $ situations, family , friends , job , country politics, physical looks, health and relationships issues will exist. I have faced them all and so will you and you will come through those (look back and make note of adversities you have conquered already)
  - give yourself a break and don’t live with expectations and pressure to conquer the world (in terms of success, attention, fame etc). 
  - at the end of the day you just need 1 job, 1 partner, 1 home, 1 car and just few good friends to be happy. You will have it. Everything else is excess. 
  - At 50 I find helping other makes me more happy. Help others with time , money , or just listening 
  - travel travel travel (cheaply ie camp, hike , surf, swim) 
  - get spiritual and have a dog. Help others even when you need help more. 
  
 

  SA sucks but looking back it was least of my problem even in time it seemed like life dealt me worst cards. 
  
 

  I hope it helps at least 1 person …. If yes, I ask that you help 2 others. 
  
 

  Tk care SA friends."
"Hey everyone,
  45M married, kids, with severe anxiety. Been seeing a therapist for about a year now and it’s helped but I recently had a huge setback which had put me back close to where I was before starting therapy.
  
 

  I know I don’t do enough to help myself. I’ve been bad at meditating, personal mantras, grounding techniques. I want to develop a routine and am looking for ideas.
  
 

  I eat healthy but exercise has been problematic because I have a fear of getting my heart rate up. I recently started cycling but had another setback and have been afraid to start again. I also don’t drink alcohol and have a max of 3-4 Oz of weak coffee in the morning. I keep a dash diet.
  
 

  I am interested especially in people who aren’t taking SSRIs, but anyone is welcome to share. Just please let me know if you’re on an SSRI or not. I alleviate with Xanax right now but I know is not sustainable. I am seriously weighing going on an SSRI. My main hold back is the sexual side effects. Lost 130lbs over the course of a year and sex has been better that the past decade. I’m hesitant to screw that up.
  
 

  What is your daily self help/maintenance routine like? Mediation, yoga, a round of grounding techniques, etc? What works well for you during a high anxiety moment or period?"
"I guess I just don't know where to go from here. I tried to go to therapy tonight but it was a telehealth appointment and my phone lost reception. I had to cancel and my therapist scolded me for missing and made me feel a lot of shame. I tried to reach out to about a dozen friends over the past month or two, and nobody's biting. My personal life is kinda killing me and I don't have anybody to talk to. My heart is breaking. Friends I thought would always be there are ghosting, my family situation isn't helping. I feel so pathetic. I'm 43 and feel so alone. I would do anything for someone to just reach out and ask me how I'm doing. I just want someone to care. I also want to go on a bender and just get so fucked up that I forget that I want to kill myself."
"I see a lot of similarities here with what I experience and what other people experience. But either on the sexual health forums, or forums for men, I cannot seem to find anyone who has the same issues as me. 
  
 

  The title most often refers to sexual performance, which is true, but my performance anxiety seems to be more than just sexual in nature.
  
 

  Basically it's like this: As soon as anything sexual happens, my body goes into fight or flight and I cannot get an erection. Alone I'm fine, but with another person, I struggle significantly. 
  
 

  Everyone says this goes away with time. I've been married 20 years, this has only ever gotten worse, it's NEVER gone away. 
  
 

  So a few years ago, I saw a doctor about ED pills and started using them. They work great. Life savers, except then I ""finish"" incredibly quickly. I'm told this is also a symptom of anxiety. 
  
 

  It feels like whatever I do, I'm doomed to have sexual frustrations. Many people relate to one or the other, but not both. I'm really at my wits end. I feel like I'm the only man in the world with this issue and BOTH of them!??! Are you kidding me?!
  
 

  Now back to the other, non-sexual side. If there's a task to do. I cannot perform it under pressure. Speeches, exams, all of them. If there's any pressure on the outcome, my brain turns to mush. I've sat in exams (when I was younger) completely unable to write anything even though I had studied. My brain just shuts down. For fight flight or freeze, my body chooses freeze. 
  
 

  I'm really good at juggling, I can only do it when no one is watching. As soon as someone watches, I'm hyper aware of EVERYTHING, and screw things up instantly. I'm like this with everything in life. As soon as something matters to me I'm unable to do it. I can't draw, type, give a speech, take an exam and as discussed, have sex. 
  
 

  I don't really know what to do. I've thought about finally taking the medication (lexapro), but I'm so scared it will break my brain completely.
  
 

  Please tell me someone, somewhere has a similar issue?"
"Hey folks,
  So if you’ve tried CBD oil or are currently using it to help with anxiety, I’m curious what was your first experience like? I mean when you tried it the first time or first 2-3 times? 
  
 

  I just picked up a bottle of 25mg solution from my local farmers market after having a long discussion with the person selling it. I guess the dose is 1ml, but I was sort of mentally comparing it to Xanax, for which I have a .25 rx, but only take half a tablet at a time and is effective for me.
  So I took half a ml.
  
 

  I am feeling it, but I’m anxious because of the new sensation. It’s close to Xanax but a bit deferent. Going to try again tomorrow and Monday. The lady said 3 consecutive days at the same dose to get the full benefit. 
  So far it’s definitely calming me down on one front if I can let go and enjoy the relaxed feeling and not be so anxious. I think as a first time use, Xanax is slightly more effective but for such a low dose this is good. About 40 min into it I was feeling very lightheaded but not high. 1 hour and ten minutes later the lightheadedness seems to have went way down but I’m having occasional chest pain and pressure because of the new sensation - again I’m anxious at trying this new thing.
  
 

  Sorry for the long rant…"
"Hi, just got my license, I am 41 and diagnosed and medicated with depression and anxiety for almost a decade. 
  I get a lot of anxiety driving alone.. how do u cope with it?
  Bless u all."
"This, chest pain, and the heart palpitations are the worst of the somatic symptoms I'm having from anxiety. Being lightheaded for a good part of the day even when properly breathing just sucks. I consciously take over breathing when this is happening to make sure I don't exacerbate it, but breathing seems to be just one component of this. Ugh. So sick and tired of all this. It freaks me out when I'm driving, it impairs my ability to think and function."
"I know that anxiety (aswell as depression) it’s chronic, but there are times when I can spend a whole month feeling awful (I’m medicated since the beggining of the pandemic). It starts with something little and then something else happens.. and so on and so on.. and maybe it is not stuff that can make u feel anxious, but you are already on the train you know? 
  So today I was feeling better, after an awful weekend, when I was also sick and on my period (this is huge for my anxiety), and now my dog is not feeling really well (she has chronic leukemia).. so now I feel awful again, and my belly hurts, and I have to wait for tomorrow morning to take her to the vet (cause she needs a blod exam and needs to be fasting for at least 8 hours)..
  So… sorry for the rant.. but how do u guys deal with this? When anxiety becomes a downward spiral and you can’t find the way to get out?
  (Sorry for bad english.. just in case)
  Bless u all"
"I was diagnosed with GADD many years ago and did well for many years after the diagnosis 
  Currently (F44) I find my anxiety to have escalated to the point that work actually keeps me emotionally afloat,""Me"" time is the most stress reducing thing I do. 
  My daughter who is mid 20""s and her fiancé live with me and it causes me significant anxiety. 
  They aren't bad and well behaved but they constantly are shutting doors, going up and down the stairs and talking in the hallway. All these things aren't bad but overtime I've realized how insanely stressful this has become and I don't honesty know why? 
  If they go away for half a Saturday I feel like a new woman just because I don't hear those sounds and the quiet is so soothing, even if it's for only a few hours. 
  I was bullied throughout my childhood and then I had an abusive marriage for many years and I feel like the constant noise somehow triggers my anxiety and my heart rate is always elevated because of these daily things. 
  Any input is appropriated"
"My primary GP isn't enough to help me with my anxiety issues. The question is what next? Do I seek a therapist or go straight to a psychiatrist? 
  
 

  Why do you choose one over the other? 
  
 

  I'm tired of throwing meds at it and waiting stuff out. This 6+ months of this med and 6+ months of that med and suddenly I'm 42 years old and still wake up on Saturday morning having panic attack nightmares and crying at work because I'm too overwhelmed. 
  
 

  And you know what does work and no one is ever happy to prescribe it is alprazolam. I take half when I feel like I'm not working myself back down and sometimes I'll take a whole one when I feel like sleep is going to be a challenge. And it works. And doctors hate prescribing it. I've got 30 pills from over 2 months ago and still have probably 10-15 left. I dont abuse, I use as a tool."
"At the moment I am 50 minutes into my first Kratom experience an it’s amazing! I have suffered from anxiety for 20 years and have tried numerous ways to treat my condition, but I have to admit that the effects of this plant is working tremendously! I am calm and focused without feeling drowsy. 
  
 

  For the brand, amount consumed and place of purchase: 
  
 

  I purchased 100 grams of White Meang Da at my local smoke shop and used approximately 4 grams ( I’m 6’1 225lbs)
  
 

  I honestly don’t know how I went so long without finding out about this seeing that my girlfriend of four years is from Thailand!🤦🏽"


"Hello, I am 48 F and have been dealing with panic attacks which lead to dizziness and hand numbness. name all the panic side effects and I have them.
  
 

  I was prescribed Venlafaxine, which is an anti - depressant. I want help but I do not want to be dependant for life. Does anyone know how addictive this drug is? and how much does it help? after coven my anxiety got worse. I take lorazepam when I have an attack but I am not addicted, never have been. Only as needed basis.
  
 

  How does this drug work if anyone knows... I suffer from fatigue on a day to day basis, because on the anxiety. I really want to improve my life but can I eventually come off them?"
"A bit of background: I'm a 41-year-old man in New York City. On the surface, my life has been very good. I recently married a wonderful woman (43F), and just last week accepted a new job that I'm very excited about. I'm a recovering alcoholic with five years' sobriety and am very active in AA.
  
 

  For my entire life, I've struggled with a particular problem: not being present. This manifests itself in a number of different ways.
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  * Frequent, intense daydreams, often involving imagined conversations or confrontations with others. These will provoke a physical response, typically full-body shaking, repetitive hand movements, and compulsively rubbing the back of my head. They sometimes occur when I'm in the middle of a conversation. They cause me to stop listening to what another person is saying.
  * A compulsive need to check my phone, even if all I do is remove it from my pocket, open it up, and then put it back. Twitter tends to be the app I open most often but I also open Instagram, Reddit, and other apps that have frequently updated information. I find that I look at these apps when I don't even want to, like when I'm in the middle of a conversation. This conveys that I'm not interested in what other people are doing, when this isn't my intention. 
  * Often lacking awareness of my personal space. I'm a big man (6 foot 2, 200 pounds) and am constantly bumping into people and objects, awkwardly standing in the way, or otherwise forcing others to maneuver around me.
  * Boneheaded decisions and general absentmindedness. A typical incident occurred on Saturday. My wife asked me to go to the farmer's market to buy mint, peaches, and lettuce. I arrived and fell almost into a trance, seeking to accomplish the errand as quickly as possible. Instead, I managed to buy mint that was rotten and two peaches that were bruised, all from the same stall. I should have shopped around and, if unable to find any good mint, not bought it at the market at all. But I was so spacey that I didn't think to do this. As a result, this almost ruined a nice dinner my wife had planned to make last night.
  
 

  My wife is running out of patience with these lapses, and with my inability to be present. She wonders whether it's about her, and feels convinced that I truly don't want to be around her. I reassure her that it isn't about her, at all, though I don't blame her for feeling this way. I just can't seem to focus. I feel trapped in this cycle where I try so hard to please her and others that I end up making mistakes and pleasing no one.
  
 

  I recently began seeing a new therapist, who suspects it might be OCD. We've only had one session, though. If anyone has any advice I would be grateful. Thank you!"
"I’m only sharing this in the hope that even if it helps one single person, it’s worth it. 
  
 

  My husband (45M) is a lifelong anxiety sufferer. He’s tried so many different things over the years. Fitness, meditation, therapy, medication etc- all to varying levels of efficacy. 
  Medication was absolutely the most effective in managing his symptoms but he is a semi professional race car driver and it made him too drowsy to the point it became dangerous, so he did not continue. 
  
 

  Fast forward to the beginning of this year. He discovered he is lactose intolerant. From there, he also discovered that he has severe sensitivity to milk protein (not just lactose) so he quit all dairy for 1 month. 
  The difference is night and day. 
  In the nearly 20 years we’ve been together, I’ve never seen him so much lighter and worry free. It’s incredible. 
  He said his incessant worrying has all but stopped, his physical symptoms of chest tightness and upset stomach has reduced by 80%. It’s just amazing. 
  
 

  Im not suggesting that this is a fix-all for everyone, but if even one person can find this helpful, then it’s worth sharing. 
  
 

  Side notes: he did consume a lot of dairy prior to quitting. He had been drinking whole glasses of milk and lots (LOTS) of cheese since he was about 4."
My life in in upheaval. I’m falling apart from the stress. Can’t eat but I’m starving. All I want to do is sleep and I take care of my father. I’m in a rock and a hard place. Backed again a wall. I won’t call my psychiatrist I don’t need more meds that’s not going to help. Going into therapy now but I can’t even speak I’m so shook. For background I have no drivers license or passport I let them both expire. I’m so fucked up and feel like a failure (50f)
Background 50/f 2x divorced only child who due to severe anxiety and depression moved home. I lost mom 3 years ago. I’m watch dad slowly go down. I’m isolating and procrastinating. I use medicinal oils and obv a benzodiazepines. (My insurance stopped covering klonopin so they put me on valium which is ridiculous) tonight dad had a bad accident fell twice from fainting. I took one valium and vaped a lot my heart is still coming out of my body. I’m scared and sobbing and don’t want any more valium
"I'm 43 and have had a couple panic attacks in my life. The first being during a bad LSD trip when I was 19 - something I've never wanted to feel again but unfortunately have had a couple since. I used to believe these were ""flashbacks"" but I've come to realize that they are panic attacks. Normally after coming off the attack I would feel kind of euphoric and calm - then the next day it was like nothing ever happened.  
  
  However. Eight days ago I woke up in the middle of the night having one of these episodes and was up for a few hours with it. Since then, for eight days now, I have not felt normal at all. I've never struggled with anxiety, but now I feel it - my chest is tight, my hands and feet are in cold sweats, I can't eat, and worst of all I feel disassociated and my mind will not let me forget about what is going on. I know it's all in my head and if I could just forget about feeling this way, it would go away. There's nothing particularly stressful in my life right now and I'm just feeling anxious about feeling anxious.  
  
  I have an appointment with a therapist on Monday and to get me through til then I picked up some water soluble CBD to try and get my body to just release a little bit to feel some relief. Most of what I've read about GAD and similar are from people who have struggled with it all their lives, this just hit like a ton of bricks out of nowhere and I want it to stop :("
"I’ve (44f) recently been formally diagnosed with social anxiety but I’ve known for quite a while that I fit the definition of socially anxious as well as introverted. My issue, though, is that my therapist is now telling me I need to go out and meet people and grow a support network. 
  
 

  Beyond the idea of meeting people scaring the crap out me because of the anxiety around actually talking to people; I’ve never felt lonely. I prefer my small bubble of my husband and son. People literally exhaust me and when I do go out and do shopping and such, I need a few days to just decompress from that. It’s absolutely numbing to be around people. It’s been like that my whole life. Even when I was younger I never had more than 1-2 friends, and only for short periods of time. 
  
 

  Is it wrong to prefer to be mostly alone? My therapist thinks it’s because of newer online interactions and the way we communicate now, but this has been my status quo for my whole life. I don’t even have much of an online presence either outside of Reddit or scrolling through YouTube."

"Hello, I have ADHD and I'm High Sensitive. Are there more of ""me""? How do you cope? And PTSD (PTSS in Dutch) Are you also on medication/therapy? If yes, which??"
"50/f/2x divorced. Live at home with my parents, mom died and dads gone downhill fast. Self admitted twice. Last time 2008 saved my life. My morning anxiety is insane. I wake up in full sweats shaking. Have to take a benzo just to get out of bed. I hate the whole thing and fear addiction. I try daily not use them unless my heart is racing. I’ve been using medical marijuana for years. Lately that’s not helping me in at my end. My best friend is worried about me."
"I know my ADHD all my life, my high sensitivity just a couple of years (I'm 44 now) I read a lot about it; everything was falling in it's place.. Why I feel different, why I like to be alone, why I hate loudness. But also positive things; people I don't know like starting a conversation with me, I feel over the moon eating something I really love, when I hear my favorite music. But with music there's also sad songs. I feel the pain in the song.."
"Hey folks. What was your first experience with Lexapro? Day two of 5mg for GAD, and I’m lightheaded and my bowls aren’t happy. Did you feel more anxious the first few days or weeks? What side effects did you have? Did the lightheadedness go away? Those of you who switched, what did you switch to and how has the new drug been working out?"
"I'm 45 and I've been driving since I was 16. Within the last few years, I developed diabetic retinopathy, and due to the (awful) laser surgeries, I lost most of my peripheral vision. I have to take a field test and a driving test every 2 years, and when my peripheral vision completely goes, I won't be allowed to drive at night by law.
  
 

  Today, I was driving to work, and it was still dark and raining really bad. I couldn't even see the lines in the road and I probably looked drunk. I couldn't see the entrance ramp for the freeway, and I almost went up the curb and through the guardrail (my car was fine). I ended up sitting in a parking lot until the sun came up, which was at least an hour, shaking like a leaf. When the sun finally came up, I went to work, but I was an hour late. My boss knew because I texted him while I was sitting in my car, but I told him that I overslept because I was embarrassed. 
  
 

  I have anxiety attacks every time I have to drive in the dark, even before this, but definitely now.
  
 

  I don't really know what I'm asking. I guess I just needed to vent."
"It is 1:30 pm and I am just now pushing myself out of bed. I am 48 and suffer from general anxiety disorder and severe depression. I take 225 MG effexor, 2 MG rexulti and have taken .25 klonopin for the past two days. I took it last week as well, twice. Before that I took it off and on. My psychiatrist doesn't want me taking it long term but nothing else works. So instead of taking it I just suffer. Wallow in anxiety and depression.
  
 

  Anyone find anything else that works? Buspar doesn't, tried that. Therapy isn't helping but I am not quitting it."
I find comfort reading posts on this forum and was curious if anyone else found similar sites or groups? I am on the discord and find it helpful.
I don't know how strange this is but I've had anxiety and depression issues for quite a while I've noticed it's more anxiety than depression at this point in time even though I cry constantly. But I went to the doctor two weeks ago maybe three changed my medications at least my antidepressant and then I went and had some shots put in my knees which I've done before not a problem. Normally I spend my days with my grandkids or at least going in the mornings and getting them off to school and get him in the afternoon well with Christmas break and the snow and ice their dad was home all week. So I've been home for a week with ice and snow I couldn't get out and now I don't want to go out I can't go out I can't go out my door I feel so scared to go out my door My balance has been off for a while they've done scans in my head and I'm 49 He's not supposed to get agoraphobia at 49 and of course with googling things doesn't really say that you don't want to leave the house it does say it could lead you that but could have that have happened in 2 weeks of course my Doctor is gone till the 3rd I can see other people in his office but what's the point they can't do anything they don't even know me I don't even if he knows me anymore because he's busy busy busy. I'm not suicidal. I'm not wanting to hurt people or hurt myself or anything I just want to be able to do things to be able to get out of my room get in my car drive to my daughter's house and going our house but she's got stairs and I'm a big girl really big and I have a hard time walking I do have a hard time going up her stairs because they're very steep and that scares me also her husband had to try and help me get in the car the other night The first night it snowed and I was so scared I couldn't get in the car I couldn't lift my leg up high enough I couldn't get in the car and he doesn't know how to help me he doesn't ever had to do that he's never seen me at my worst and my daughter wasn't home yet All I could do is cry and I've been crying ever since I don't know if that had something to do with me getting in the car or not it just can't I just can't do anything but sit here and think about walking out to the car and what I want to do because I can't do anything I'm so alone
"Hi folks,
  
 

  Not really looking for advice, just need a space to let off steam because I'm finding things hard at the moment and I know it will pass, it's just incredibly tedious while it's ongoing. 
  
 

  
 

  I have longstanding GAD, secondary to Autism. I'm 41 and have learned to live with my issues pretty well, hence knowing this will pass, but fucking hell does it have to be such hard work? I've not got it as bad as many others and I'm trying to keep things in perspective, but I'm finding it very hard to talk to people, see people, leave my flat for anything other than walking by myself. I live with my partner who is caring, but he isn't ""my carer,"" and I don't want him to be. 
  
 

  
 

  This is partly triggered by a benefits review, and I know once the decision has been made my constant background anxiety will reduce a bit and hopefully make the short peaks of anxiety easier to ride out, but I've got a possible 8 weeks of waiting for that decision, and there's every likelihood I'll lose my disability benefit and have to go to appeal. Theoretically I should qualify, but it's a crapshoot unfortunately, 
  
 

  
 

  SIIIGH. Just going to keep breathing!"
"Hello,
  43m here 6’6 255lbs
  Past two days I have been experiencing a almost like brief second on and off electric zinger from right groin area between shaft and thigh upper quadrant that feels like it follows a path same path up through my stomach to right side of chest. 
  
 

  Last night went to ER and did CT and ultra sound and was unable to find anything. No clots no hernias. No pain or blood in urinating or stools. 
  
 

  BP 114/75 most the time. I do have sinys bradycardia so average heart rate 50-70 hiwver a panic attack will easily double those numbers and have recently. 4 keg tests in past 3 months all normal. Countless blood tests and scans all normal. 
  
 

  Super mild PAD in left leg.
  
 

  I have been dealing with a lot of depression/anxiety/panic attacks and health anxiety the past few months. My appetite has been very low trying to eat is so uncomfortable. Been losing weight and some weakness but still manage to get 4-6k steps a day. I have been home the past few months working through my health anxiety and depression. 
  
 

  I do smoke cigs working on wuitting down to 15 a day vs 20 and cutting every week. 
  
 

  My total cholesterol is 220 so started stations a week ago (docs say not related)
  
 

  I take .5mg clonazapam in the morning and maybe another at night if needed. Have been for close to 10 years. 
  
 

  Start 5mg rosuvastatin every other night per doc.
  
 

  What could these zingers be????
  
 

  Please help I'm struggling and want to heal."

I want a hobby to lose myself in. I feel like I’m boring as hell. Especially with Covid. My social anxiety is so so happy that I have been lucky enough to WAH for the past 2 years but honestly it’s just made it worse. Forced social interaction - seems I do need a little of it.

"I drank some water and thought I inhaled some and my chest kinda hurts.... also smoked some weed and been anxious lately.... overthinking? I thought when I drank the water there’s some in my lungs? Tho I tried coughing I think I’m fine? I can breathe.... 
  
 

  I also been smoking cigs maybe that’s why my chest kinda hurts??"
"Head like twitched?
  
 

  Maybe just anxiety but I thought it was weird also smoked a lot...? Was it my brain??

  I smoked a lot today and it happened maybe 3 times WTF"

"I'm 45 and have been in the same tiny efficiency apartment for 23 years and been at the same job for 21 years. I've thought about renting a free-standing house for a while, but never pursued it. My reason for wanting to do it is being tired of sharing a wall/ceiling with someone. A house close by was available and was lower in rent than most houses, so I toured it, applied, and was accepted. I agonized over a decision to take it for almost a week but signed the lease and regretted it. I considered trying to get out of it but have accepted that it's a done deal.  
  
 

  My total expenses will jump $500-600 per month, although my current apartment is extremely cheap at $580, so it's relative. A bigger concern is that I'm at a precarious place with my job. I can't take it anymore, have wanted to quit for years. I'm making okay money, but the stress is high, and when I make a mistake like I did today, I get very down and want to leave. If I left, it would likely be for a much lower-paying job, making my financial situation with the house more tenuous. This house could force me to stay at a job that's destroying my mental well being.  
  
 

  My new upstairs neighbor who is kind of loud is making me think that it might be an okay decision, but that's seriously the only thing that is recommending this move. I'm back to serious feelings of anxiety."

"I have suffered anxiety for many years, and the symptom I fear the most is dizziness. It really terrifies me and when I feel a bit dizzy I panic. 
  Do you have any similar experience?
  Thank you"
"Hi everyone,
  
 

  I'm (40m) new to this sub, and hope that this post is appropriate. I'm writing to ask for support in helping my fiance (43f), who appears to be suffering from crippling anxiety.
  
 

  A bit of background: My fiance grew up in a stressful home with a father who was emotionally and occasionally physically abusive. Her father is now estranged from the family, and he and my fiance do not get along. However, they share many characteristics, and my fiance frequently expresses dread at the idea that she's turning into him.
  
 

  Her anxiety attacks follow a certain pattern. She will develop intense fear that the worst-case scenario is bound to happen, and that it's entirely up to her to prevent it. For instance, mild criticism from her boss will lead her to believe without a shred of doubt that she's going to get fired. She becomes convinced that her friends do not like her. Throughout the pandemic, she had an anxiety attack about the safety of the vaccines, and has developed an acute fear of becoming infected because she is convinced that she will either die or surely get long COVID. 
  
 

  Tellingly, she seldom acts on these fears. She's great at her job, has many friends, is universally well-liked, and, in spite of her COVID fears, has not been a shut-in during the pandemic: We've gone to restaurants, friends' houses, traveled, etc. 
  
 

  Each of her anxiety attacks is followed by a period of self-loathing, where she feels immense guilt and shame at subjecting me to them. She has expressed that living with me can feel confining because there's nowhere she can go to hide. She often says that she is afraid that her attacks will make me miserable, and that they'll ruin our relationship. I often think that these things are self-fulfilling prophecies
  
 

  Also, if it isn't clear, 95% of the time she's a delightful, joyous person, and I love her dearly. We have a great relationship, our values are aligned, we love each other's families, and have planned an exciting wedding.
  
 

  But I admit that I struggle to respond effectively to her anxiety attacks. I'm a recovering alcoholic with four years' sobriety, and very often my only resource is in the language of recovery. I also allow my frustration to get the better of me, and end up mansplaining things in a logical way. That doesn't go well. We get trapped in these exhausting, circular arguments that go on for hours. 
  
 

  She has a talk therapist that she meets with, virtually, every week; she also takes anti-anxiety medication on occasion as well. But she's concerned that these measures just aren't working. She feels that she's made little progress in therapy, and that her condition is only growing worse.
  
 

  I love her more than anything and just want to help, but I'm afraid my attempts to do so aren't working. If anyone has any advice, I'd be grateful to hear it."
"Been dealing with anxiety on and off, more than usual lately and smoked a bit of a cart (weed cartridge) and I heard this company may not be legit but they were tested by a real company and some in dispensaries?
  
 

  Anyway sorry for rambling but I felt this my head like maybe almost twitching? I don’t know I got anxious it happened a few times 😕
  
 

  Gonna drink some water - maybe I worried if the weed is as bad is it anxiety??"
"Hello everyone, so today I found out my grandmothers sister had ovarian cancer and passed away at 57. May she Rest In Peace
  I kind of wanted to know how genetics work? I do have anxiety so I’m just over worrying"
"Hi,
  I have done talk therapy for many years, now I am trying EMDR. I have always thought that finding the root cause of my anxiety would heal it. I find it helped really to understand me better, but I am finding it difficult to help with the anxiety itself.
  Have you found any therapy that helped?
  I also feel that along with anxiety comes depression and it becomes a more complex situation.
  Thank you"
"I was doing the wim hoff exercise and was feeling fairly good and held my breath for like 30-45 seconds ish maybe a minute and thought I felt light headed and read online you can get hypoxia? Lol oof 
  
 

  Also a smoker, cigs and green 
  
 

  Was feeling anxious...."
Just started taking my medication again cause I suffer with terrible anxiety was in a relationship for 10 years and now ex partner will not even talk to me which makes it all ten times worse it's all quite overwhelming
"I haven't had good experiences when it comes to online classes of any kind (whether it's art therapy, online theatre class, or just plain online school).
  
 

  So, when my mom sent me a school announcement that said they would have a day to watch a movie (it was Onward) I didn't want to attend, but I thought: ""Why not? you get to watch a movie. I bet you don't even have to talk!""
  
 

  So I attended, I was told it would take place from 9:00 am to 11:00 am that made sense the movie lasted1h 42m so they would probably have time to wait for all the students to join the class, and then they would play the movie and end at 11:00 am.
  
 

  But when I tried joining the class, I had to wait 11 minutes only to see the words ""No one accepted your request to join.""
  
 

  My mom told me I had to use a different account to enter so blah blah blah I did enter using the other account.
  
 

  10:00 am came,
  
 

  The class ended up getting delayed due to ""internet connection problems"" or whatever. So it instead started at 10:00 am and I had time to do eat breakfast, watch videos, text my friends until then (none of which I did).
  
 

  In the beginning, I was worried I'd be like an outsider because I wasn't sure If I was the only one who didn't go to the monthly/weekly online classes (it was optional) one of the other kids even asked""Who is \*MY NAME\*"" that just made me feel worse.
  
 

  To start the class they did some games (like bring me, guess who, and a school trivia game) and performances (where some of the students sang or danced to songs like Two Birds or a german version of I Want to Hold Your Hand) which I did not care for.
  
 

  The entire time I kept checking the clock as it kept going and still no movie was playing, just stupid kids singing stupid songs (which I kept saying dorky stuff like""You sound just like a professional!"" 1000/10!"" outstanding!"" 11/10""""sooo good!"")
  
 

  and playing stupid games...
  
 

  When was the movie gonna start? after the last game, one of the teachers started talking about classes or something and said ""welp, that's it I'm done!""
  
 

  I was confused, ""Are they not gonna play the movie?""Is the class over?""Are they gonna play the movie now?""
  
 

  No, they didn't play the movie. They told us to leave. I was sure if I actually should but half of the class decided to leave so I did too.
  
 

  I sat through that stupid class for no reason.
  
 

  I told my mom (and I know that that really makes me sound like a child but please don't talk about that) And I started having a meltdown. Yet another class in which ended up with me having a meltdown.
  
 

  I just can't get over the fact that I was basically just crying for nothing, oh what a movie didn't play and now you're crying? grow up up you stupid crybaby! people have worse problems and don't cry! stop being a brat!
  
 

  **TL; DR**  
  I hate online classes and almost always end up having a meltdown before &amp; after having a class.
  
 

  I decided to attend a class since I thought I would have to talk and I was told I would get to watch a movie.
  
 

  The entire class was boring but I had to act like I was interested, the entire time I was wondering when the movie would start and it never did, I ended up having a huge meltdown and I got mad at myself for having it."
"I hate my job. I've been looking for a new one for months but not having any luck. I got screamed at my 3 or 4 strangers today. It was for things done by others in my company. My job is all done over the phone. It's to the point that I get sick every time the phone rings. I work from home which is nice, but I don't like talking to the customers. They can be so fucking mean and abusive. I've been in fight or flight all day. My company monitors me constantly while I'm on the clock. I get 10 minutes a week outside of breaks and lunch to use the bathroom or collect my thoughts. If I have a really rough call, it could be hours till I get a break unless I use up my 2 minutes a day of personal time, and that's not even enough time to piss and wash my hands. I get graded on calls, adherence to schedule, and response time. It's so toxic and I can't find my way out. I wish I could kill these mother fuckers. I would be so ashamed to let my kids see how their old man gets treated at work. I feel like such a worthless fuck. The only people who get ahead here are those willing to fuck people over. Honest people like me don't get shit. I wish I was fucking dead sometimes. I'm so sick of selling my soul for cash, and not very much of it."
I'm 42 M and After my divorce I have not been able to find anyone in past 8 years. I feel I am going to die alone. DAE feel the same
"I am 41 (birthday just in dec) and have been suffering with anxiety since I csn remember bit due to abusive parents I never knew what it was or what triggers me. I'm a sped teacher and as well and have been focusing all of my energy helping my students all while ignoring my own issues. Well this year I had a parent attempt to charge me with abusing her child ( it was bogus and found unwarranted by dcfs) but the dam fucking broke with my anxiety. I spiraled within a month with the nega tdd I've self talk and overall depression. I almost whit my job and my wife almost left me. I decided to see a psychiatrist and took some time off before the xmas break. I've seen her twice now and I'm realizing that I am suffering with anxiety, she actually broke through with me this past session to see that I never had people around me as a tyke telling that I was good but instead blaming me for their own issues so of course as an adult I'm trained to blame myself well before anything happens. 
  
 

  I've never realized how quickly I can get sucked into my own thoughts and how demonstrative they can be. I'm hoping I can get on some meds soon. I spiraled tonight on the way to a party and almost shut down for the entire time. I knew what was happening in the moment but felt trapped, like a prisoner in my own head."
"This is going to be long, but here goes. I'm 48 and have had panic attacks and severe anxiety after I was sexually abused at the age of 5.
  
 

  I was diagnosed back in 1996. I had no idea what was wrong with me all those years. I hid in silence because I could not explain adequately what I was experiencing to my parents and they just thought I was being a drama queen when I had my attacks. When I would have a panic attack I would tell them ""I am getting nervous again"". I spent my whole childhood and young adulthood feeling weird and different. I couldn't go to normal things like sleep over parties, or socialize like everyone else because of the ""spells"" I would get. I only had one good friend and was uncomfortable in crowds or with a lot of people. I am an only child and always felt lonely.
  
 

  One night back in 1996, I was panicking so bad and so extremely depressed that I called a crisis hotline. They told me I was having panic attacks and gave me the phone numbers of experts to call. I finally had a name for this horror. My first therapist and Psychiatrist were great. I had CBT therapy in conjunction with low dose Xanax and Prozac. Then a year into treatment, I lost my insurance coverage and could not afford to see these providers anymore.
  
 

  Over the years I took breaks from therapy, but kept taking my meds because I could only afford one provider. Fast forward to a few years ago and my psychiatrist of 21 years decided it was time to retire. He told me I was fucked. I asked why. He told me because nobody was going to prescribe me Xanax as there is a war on drugs going on.
  
 

  He had to taper me off of them just before he was set to retire. He first tried giving me a low dose of Valium along with a tricyclic antidepressant. The tricyclic depressant made me very sick and I felt zombie like so I dropped it. Prozac was no longer working on me and over the years I tried at least 15 different SSRI antidepressants and none worked or they made me feel bizarre.
  
 

  I was on a low dose of .5 mg Xanax twice a day for 21 years and never had to raise my dose. The Valium taper was making my panic attacks much worse so he switched it to Xanax extended time release version and I was back to having 4-5 major panic attacks a day. Then he walked out of my life forever and I had no meds at all.
  
 

  Over the next 3 years I could not find one doctor who would prescribe me Xanax and would only give me antidepressants which are useless for me or make my condition worse. I ended up quitting my job of 6 years and handing over the keys to my car to my husband because the panic attacks were so bad I could no longer drive. I ended up with full blown agoraphobia and didn't barely leave the house for 3 years.
  
 

  Finally 2 months before my mother suddenly died, I found a nurse practitioner who would give me .5 Xanax twice a day. I immediately started feeling better and wanted to leave the house again. I started going for walks and even drove the car around the block a few times. Then my mother died and my condition became exasperated. I was having panic attacks around the clock. I got a grief counselor and my shitty insurance wouldn't cover her, so I had to pay $200 a session which I could hardly afford. She got mad at me because I filed for disability without telling her while she was away on vacation. She got paperwork when she came back and started yelling at me about the amount of work I caused her.
  
 

  I was so put off by her attitude that I fired her and told her off. The next day social security called me and said my therapist called them and said that I no longer wanted to pursue my disability claim. I was in shock that she did that. WTF? I told them that was not true and still filed. I was turned down. The reason they gave was that because she told them that I had no disabilities at all. She did that to be spiteful!
  
 

  Then the next therapist I found tried to be my friend. She asked to go out with me to get some coffee and during another session she asked if I had good handwriting. She wanted me to write 50th birthday party invitations out for her husband's surprise party. I was like WTF?! So I stopped making anymore appointments with her.
  
 

  The next therapist I got was a young guy who just graduated from college. He started to be all chummy with me and then I noticed our sessions were all about him. I started to feel like I was his therapist and I didn't get a good feeling. He asked me for advice and told me how much he hated his mother. He admitted he was stealing opiates from his grandfather's medicine cabinet. I was quiet as a church mouse when he was telling me this trying not to judge him, because nobody is perfect, but that shocked me. I was thinking of dropping him, but was feeling like maybe it was me expecting too much and maybe the bad feelings I was getting was all ""in my head"" The next session I had an appointment for, the office was all dark and nobody was there when I arrived. Then I was told by the mental health group he was working for, that he was ""no longer with them"". I found out he was fired because he was addicted to opiates.
  
 

  The next therapist, who was another young person I got told me if I had a panic attack to get a bowl of water and fill it with ice cubes and stick my head in the bowl and that was the cure for panic attacks. Also, I was told to jump into the shower and only turn on the cold water. I was also told to meditate them away and do deep breathing exercises. I told her that does not help me and she said that is the latest and most innovative treatment for anxiety disorders. Meditation and deep breathing exercises make me even more nervous. I quit immediately after that.
  
 

  Then my final and last therapist dropped me after 3 sessions. He was a psychologist who I actually liked. Instead of 45 minute sessions he would only have 30 minute sessions with me. They moved so quickly, he did not have the time to know more about me. He barely let me get a word in and kept interrupting me when I wanted to tell him a little about what I was going through. Instead, he kept making me write down famous inspirational quotes in a journal which meant nothing to me and weren't helping. We were having phone sessions because of my agoraphobia. The agoraphobia is so bad, I couldn't even leave the house to have a funeral for my own mother and had no services for her at all. My husband had to handle it all for me and got her cremated which was not her last wishes leading me to feeling extreme guilt.
  
 

  The grief from the loss of my mother is so terrible that my panic attacks got even more frequent and relentless. After the third session, he asked if I was on meds and I told him I take .5 mg Xanax twice a day. He immediately got all quiet. Then he said ""I want you off of the Xanax immediately"". He told me to fire my nurse practitioner and in order to have more sessions with him, I would have to get a psychiatrist and get off the Xanax and take antidepressants instead. He said he does not work with people on controlled substances. I was in a state of shock!
  
 

  I told him that I did not take them everyday which is the truth and he still would not budge. I was begging him not to abandon me and all he said was ""Sorry"". He told me to call him when I complied with what he told me to do otherwise I was not allowed to have anymore sessions with him. He dropped me 3 days before my first Christmas without my mother. That was a huge blow to me. It made me even more panicked and depressed. I felt so abandoned.
  
 

  I spent Christmas on the phone with a crisis hotline because I was having severe panic attacks. Since then I have been calling loads of therapists in my health insurance network and either they don't call back after I leave a message on their answering machine, or they say they are filled up and are not taking anymore patients. My grief, anxiety and panic disorder has gotten so bad, I now have an enlarged heart and severe pitting edema where my body has become so swollen I can hardly walk. I think the stress is killing me.
  
 

  I am feeling like there is no help out there and if there is they are not very good at what they do. I no longer have any trust in the mental health providers out there that are so called ""experts"" in treating anxiety and Panic disorder. I am having more anxiety from the fact that I feel there is no help out there. Do you feel the same? What has happened to you? I would like to hear your stories too so I know I am not the only one dealing with this."
"I feel like giving up. I'm 50 and have bern a caregiver for the past 10 yrs, I don't recognize myself at all, Covid has stopped me from placing my hubs in a nursing home, his dementia is just getting worse, I just don't recognize myself, noone has helped me at all, noone in my family understands the impact of seeing my husband die everyday. I can't stand my brothers happiness with his money, while my life has turned to absolute shit. I can't seen to just pick myself up by bootstraps, I don't have it in me. My mom who I also took care of turned into a bitch, everything I did was for nothing. 
  I'm just so tired. I only have here to rant. I dud all the right things, served, got a degree, great kids, a great husband, and for what to have it all crumble in ten yrs."
"I'm not great at communication, especially when it comes to the people closest to me. I was never close to my family and I have no friends to talk about anything I'm into. My fiancée isn't as geeky as I am, so when it comes to the stuff I really get obsessed with, I have to resort to Twitter and Reddit for any kind of conversation.
  
 

  When it comes to my feelings, it's harder to talk anyone because, as I've posted before, people either don't get it or don't care. My fiancée is in a similar boat, when it comes to having someone to talk to, but she at least has a small network of friends she texts with everyday. So whenever she wants to talk about me in general, she has a means of venting. I have no one.
  
 

  We recently moved into a house and we're rapidly approaching the wedding. I have been working in a new job that I don't particularly care for, but once again, I don't feel like I can talk to my fiancée about this. She works from home and never gets to leave the house, I at least am around people. I just have no close friends at work and again, I'm unsatisfied with the job. The few times I've tried talking to my fiancée about this, she has countered with how no one likes their job. She even made a comment about me being a straight white man, who expects everything handed to him. Honestly, that comment hurt and kinda pissed me off as I am not at all that guy. So, I don't know how to talk to anyone about how lost I feel in life, how utterly useless and directionless I feel. No one wants to hear it.
  
 

  Last night, I apparently did something that triggered my fiancée. Her ex was manipulative and a liar. My fiancée struggles with trust issues because of her ex and she feels my inability to talk to her is similar to her ex and his constant lying and keeping secrets. She suggested I don't even want to get married. I was stunned and lost for words and my silence at her comments made her believe she was right.
  
 

  Now I'm on the verge of losing everything and I don't know what to say. How do I tell her I feel alone and depressed, when she feels the same way? She may feel like I'm not seeing things from her point of view, but I don't think she sees mine either. I'm struggling to stay positive, struggling to find joy, feeling like a waste. How do I tell her this without making her feel to blame? She's all I have left, but it isn't her responsibility to save me. My own bullshit is bound to undo everything and at this point I feel so exhausted that if it all falls apart, I don't think I'll have the strength to keep going anymore. I'm at my wit's end and I feel like I can't even tell anyone. 
  
 

  How the fuck am I supposed to fix things when I just break them?"
"I've struggled with being open with my feelings and I'm failing my partner as a result. I'm pushing away my fiancée and creating doubt about our future together. How do I explain what I'm feeling, especially when many of those thoughts are dark and potentially hurtful? How do I express that my depression and anxiety often pushes me into suicidal thoughts, without offending the closest person in my life?
  
 

  Given that my fiancée struggles with some similar issues, so she may have tendency to either disregard my concerns as way too common or not big deal, or she may not understand why I feel so much worse than she does.
  
 

  I'll admit, her worries that I don't want to get married anymore aren't unfounded, as this is my 2nd marriage and I am terrified of making the same mistakes. I really struggle to not always be on defense around my fiancée and I seriously am failing at showing her I appreciate her. It's all about to fall apart and I can't even figure out what to say, because I'm terrified she won't get it.
  
 

  I know to avoid using statements that put blame on her, but there may be things I will want to express that could be seen as attacks. She fully admits that she acts a certain way because of her own family trauma, just like most of my personality has been informed by my own fucked up past. She's more, for lack of a better word, aggressive. I'm way more passive. It makes for impossible communication and I have to change this, or risk losing it all and to be damn well honest, if I lose her, I'm done. I have so little left to care about, that it's no wonder I can't express joy and focus so much on negativity.
  
 

  I fully acknowledge I need therapy/medication again, but until I get insurance again, I'm SOL. It's so fucking hard to talk to real people about this."
"This is my first time posting here so I’m sorry if it’s the wrong place or wrong tag. I’m having a breakdown and can’t think straight. 
  
 

  I (20f) recently got sick about within the last two days. Sore throat and some coughing. I don’t know why but I just can barely do anything when I’m sick. I don’t even think it’s as bad as other people, maybe I’m just sensitive I’m not sure. But every time I get sick I get this overwhelming anxiety that I’m gonna get left by everyone and no one will care for me. My mom usually always is there but she’s left for a trip for a few weeks and the rest of my family doesn’t have caretaking qualities. I don’t even think I’m afraid of passing or whatever health problems come from it. It’s just the pure thought of being alone, abandoned and sick. 
  
 

  For reference my sister (f41) passed from cancer in 2018 and it was like losing my other mother. I witnessed how her husband abandoned her and her kids, he would make excuses just to see someone else and never paid for any of her treatments or service or come when she needed him. I think at the end she felt utterly abandoned even though my mom spend day and night with her. 
  
 

  I feel scared and trapped and vulnerable every time I get sick. Just being at the doctor alone makes me feel horrible no matter what I’m there for. 
  
 

  My boyfriend knows I’m sick and he’s offering to do all these things for me and come see me but I’m scared. He’s showing me and doing things for me but I can’t push away this feeling. Like I don’t know what needs to happen for me to understand i’m not really alone. I don’t know what to do besides cry and overthink."
"Been having them lately... no I’m not a violent person.
  
 

  
 

  And I was high and anxious of course....
  
 

  
 

  One thought was: “I’m gonna kill X” but again a thought is a thought right? I mean it just popped into my head lol
  
 

  High and anxious lately?
  
 

  Maybe it’s the strain but had some weird intrusive thoughts and maybe got too high overdid it? I heard high doses (especially the strong stuff today) can cause more anxiety and make you kind of paranoid.... especially sativa.
  
 

  I mean I’m not paranoid but has some weird intrusive thoughts of violence tho I’m not a violent person....
  
 

  I mean I wouldn’t be making a post if I was right? Also had a ‘fear of going crazy’ even before I started smoking but I’m pretty sure I’m sane?
  
 

  Damn.... sorry guys"

"I see the world through patterns. I think that's part of why I became a musician when I was teenager and love things like math and programming. I'm 50 years old and never realized this thing I've wrestled with my entire life was ""anxiety"". I had bleeding ulcers when I was 8 years old. Anxiety wasn't really a thing in the late 70s/early 80's. I was finally diagnosed with GAD last spring. 
  
 

  I think the tricky part was the things that give normal people anxiety...public speaking, social situations, etc don't bother me. I'm acutely aware of the patterns of behavior and communication of those around me regularly and when those patterns change my irrational ""buddy"" develops scenarios about how it must be me.  
  
 

  Does anyone else experience this and what has helped you?"
I feel like one of the worst things about being plagued with legitimate panic attacks is that I know in my gut that when death comes for me there will be no passing peacefully no matter what. It's going to be an absolutely horrible freaking the fuck out experience.
"My daughters, 23 and 31, just lost their dad on September 1st. He was only 58 years old and it was sudden. He thought he had a stomach flu and passed 3 days later. It was sepsis from salmonella poisoning. He and I have not been together for 9 years, but still had a relationship as best friends, still loved each other. and kept the team together. My youngest daughter and I have had a rocky relationship since her dad left when she was 12. I have had anxiety since I can remember and I am 56 years old. Over the years it’s gotten better, I felt like I was handling it better anyway. Now, it’s so bad that some days I shut down completely, I feel frozen and I have that awful feeling that I want to cry all the time. I have a psychiatrist who I really like. I’ve had what feels like 100 therapists. I can’t do therapy anymore. Nothing against therapy, I just don’t feel it’s for me anymore. I’ve never felt this weak and helpless, being Worried about my girls, and myself. So my youngest has needed me more and I am here for both of them 100%. She has been staying with me off and on since her dad passed. I love my girls more than life, I will always be here for them. Because of the not so good relationship with my youngest, when she does come and stay, my anxiety would perk up, but I’ve learned patience and understanding and when to keep my mouth shut. Recently she told me about a plan that she has decided on for her future. She has been here for over a week now, and my anxiety has me frozen and shut down. I’m scared for her. I have so many things going through my head and I can’t stop. She is 23 and I would never hold her back. Where we live, there is really nothing here for her to pursue her dreams. My fear is that she is rushing this, like she can’t wait to get away from here. Is she ready?, she never is. It’s like she just wants to escape this pain and grieving process. Maybe I’m wrong, and just being an over protective mom, and, no matter what I think, I won’t stop her because I love her so much. But for right now, I’m emotionally paralyzed. I also have been my elderly dads personal caregiver for 10 years. This anxiety follows me everywhere it doesn’t even have to be about my daughters. I’m overthinking everything. I just want this to subside 🥺"
I started SSRI inhibitors last years and they have worked well for me. I look forward to a future where I no longer need medication to control my anxiety but can do so on my own. Did anyone here accomplish this? What is your story? What worked for you?
"I have two things that I'm sick of: my apartment and my job. I've been in each for 23 and 21 years, respectively. I can't take the stress of my job any longer and I can't tolerate being below and beside someone in an apartment. I want to get a new job and also rent a free-standing house. I actually toured and applied for a house rental on the weekend and am waiting for an approval or denial. Whether they approve or deny me, I have a big decision - take the house or don't take it. Both decisions are fraught with complications.
  
 

  *If I take it, I deal with some OCD relative to some ideas I have which would be activated by moving to this house. However, I think I could manage them, potentially. A bigger thing is that the higher rent of the house would cause me to need to stay at my job longer, most likely, when I want to quit. If I quit, it would likely be for a lower-paying job. If my OCD makes staying in the house impossible, I'd have to find something else, and the more I discover about rental practices, I am finding that you must have income that is 3X the rental amount. Currently I have that, but with a new job, I might not.  
  
 

  *If I don't take it, I would almost definitely want to find a new job soon. It would likely be lower paying, so I'd not be able to make the 3X rent threshold required for renting. That means I would be stuck in my current apartment.
  
 

  So it's either house or job. One has to go - my dream of having my own house or getting out of this job. Of course if I'm not selected to get the house, that takes the decision out of my hands. I'd probably be on the same pathway as choice 2, then. My area has almost no houses to rent, or they're too pricy. The one I looked at is pretty much it."
"Hi everyone,
  
 

  I have had anxiety since many years ago, I could manage it and have a normal life except for a period of time some years ago when along with depression I had to take mirtazapine.
  Now back on September 2021 I started feeling really bad and had to start taking lexapro.
  During these years I have been doing talk therapy, I have read so many pshycology books, and now I am doing EMDR and Somatic Experiencing. I practice yoga, I have done mindfulness trainings, I have a healthy diet, I have like a ""normal"" life and so I keep wondering why do I have this problem? Why I cannot heal?
  I know my experiences as a child made an impact on me and created some beliefs about me and the world that can be related. Also current stressors (I have a little kid and it's been exhausting). Maybe genetic or biological tendency.
  The thing is I try so hard to understand the reasons so I can find the way to heal but I am 41 years old and I keep having anxiety.
  I know nothing lasts forever but I wonder if this is something I'll have to live with no matter how hard I try ir how many therapies I do.
  I am not saying those things didn't help, because they did but I have not found a permanent relief. 
  Medication is working, even though It is slow and still I am not feeling totally fine.
  I think I torture myself with these questions wondering why do I have this.
  Just wanted to share it with you in case you can relate.
  Thank you."
"Talking doesn't work. I can't afford medication or therapy. Nothing fucking matters. This too is just another meaningless expression of self-pity. My nerves are shot. I feel like garbage. I hate myself. I don't want to do anything anymore. Oh well, better get back to work. I can't hide in the bathroom all day. This world is bullshit."
"I mean I have a high tolerance but I’ve been hitting a vape and only smoking a few bowls the last couple weeks.
  
 

  
 

  Might take a break. My roommate came home and I had some weird intrusive thoughts.
  
 

  
 

  I guess being too high is bad lol. I just had some weird intrusive thoughts of violence and got scared also I have an anxiety disorder.

Of randomly hurting people like WTF why does this happen I know we aren’t our thoughts just frustrating
"It seems almost all the time I’m being judged, ignored, and/or not being accepted. If I hear people talking from a distance and can’t hear the whole conversation I start to think they sometimes are talking about me. I find myself being excluded from sarcastic joking and deeper conversations. If I do comment and have a true valid point it’s ignored or treated as if I’m wrong. Someone else will make the same point worded differently and it will get validated. My question is what can all these impulsive, uncontrolled feelings be considered? Is it low self-esteem? Is it social anxiety? Is it paranoia? I am 48 days clean from benzodiazepines. I also have use to be a heroin addict for 7 years and used fentanyl for a 1 1/2. I take gabapentin and Strattera daily. I’m in a sober living at the moment and we are on Covid lockdown and it’s definitely making things worse. Please help, even relating and knowing we aren’t alone in this helps a lot!"
"I know this is a difficult question, at least for me, I am trying everything (Talk therapy, trauma therapy, reading, yoga, medication) but yet fail to understand why do I have anxiety or why it comes out of the blue? Any clue on your journeys?

"Hello all.
  
 

  I'm 48 and just coming to the realisation that I have been dealing with anxiety most of my life. I'm willing to seek treatment but am unsure where to start.
  
 

  Here in the UK, these appear to be my options:
  
 

  * Talk to the doctor, with a view to being referred.
  * Self-refer to an organisation like Mind.
  * Go private.
  
 

  If there are other options, or anyone can recommend a path to take, I'd really appreciate it.
  
 

  Thanks for your time."
They are disturbing etc
Advice for getting past them??
Based on my experiences I know there are many of people in this sub with anxiety that don't admit to alcoholism. Alcoholism causes anxiety. I'm 41 and started dealing with anxiety in my early 20s. Instead of seeking help I started drinking to cope. The drinking helped but then I had to keep drinking. 15+ years of drinking about a gallon of vodka a week before I gave up. Now my insides are fucked and withdrawals will cause some of the worst panic attacks you'll ever experience. If this is you or you're on this track my advice is please just stop. Stop now. It's not going to get better.
"If you are a kiwi - chur! - anywehere else - hello!
  
 

  Thanks for showing interest in what has essentially been a game of pin the tail on the donkey with health consultants over the past 3 years. My nightly sleep is down to 2-3 broken hours and has been for years, with my body passing out from exhaustion about every week or two for a couple of days. This is a last resort for me, and i will try to keep it informative but brief. Phase 3 is the crux if you want to skip to the HRV yarn and add your opinion thereafter.
  
 

  My question now became this:
  
 

  From 2017 - 2019ish i could go for a forest ride for up to 50km a day and clock over 1500m of elevation, and come back home and be absolutely fine. I loved it, and i would sleep like a rock initially. You bet i would continue that routine because i felt amazing doing it. What would have to change so that the parasympathetic nervous system now does not seem to function at all, and moreover, what steps do i have to take to engage the parasympathetic nervous system so that i can start not having to worry about sleep and return to an early morning routine?
  
 

  Phase 3 talks about heart rate variability as i have come to understand it.
  
 

  **Preamble**
  
 

  In 2017 i moved over to New Zealand, from Melbourne, to go bike riding as much as humanly possible, but more importantly to surround myself with cheery bugger kiwis - safe to say i ticked that box, clocking up 50-75km on average in the redwoods forest over a 3 year period, before moving down south to go back to studying full time for 2 years, which is now complete.
  
 

  in 2019, 3 or so years ago, my sleep started to become broken and proceeded to get worse as time continued. Sure enough, this eventually effected my relationships, work (!!), memory and general interest in life due to no noticeable improvement. I sought out what was essentially the opinions of trained GP's, who did blood tests, ECG's, and general lifestyle questionnaires to gauge what the lead up history was, to help them get a better picture of me. The ECG's were great, the blood tests came back as envious to the GP at the time (no concern) and the social environment at the place i was staying was all i could ask for - like minded flat mates who enjoyed a laughed, cared, and exercised and ate well - no notable concerns.
  
 

  **Phase 1 - Rotorua - 2017**
  
 

  Following on from the preamble - In New Zealand, i was prescribed melatonin (worked for 1 week out of the month i took it), a number of anti-depressants and anxiety medications for the side effect of becoming drowsy, with the hope it would send me off into the land of nod, which they did, for one month. Then i upped the dosage at the recommendation of the GP, which worked for a month, at which point the original pre medication symptoms returned and the only difference then was that i was on medication with the same original issues. I tried this with a few different medications and combinations of medications, with the hope that maybe the last one wasn't the one that was best suited for me. 6 months later i tipped them all out as i was no better off. Back to square one. I was prescribed Zopiclone and Quetiapine, to name a few, which i ended up taking together, and would know me out, however i would be awake 2-3 hours later and could rarely get back to sleep, and if i could it would be light and un beneficial. I stopped all that and battled as the medication effects were muddying my brain and memory so thought id rather go without it until a better offer came up.
  
 

  What i did notice, however did not join the dots until much later, was that every time i would go for a ride and or to the gym, i wouldn't sleep that night and i would be wrecked the next day (exercise is good for tiring you out and should lead to a good sleep, so is not worth another thought, right? maybe not so for me - so why?).
  
 

  I noticed the lack of sleep as a trend that was not improving, and i was at an all time high for boredom with what i was doing for work (carpentry). Stack a bunch of sleepless months and not showing up for work due to that on top, and all of a sudden I'm looking to get out of that small town so i don't burn anymore bridges than i already had for something i couldn't get an answer to.
  
 

  Time to make a shift to see if i can re-stoke the fire of life and flush all the bullshit sleepless nights down the gurgler. Maybe i just needed a change? Back to school i went. With no mortgage commitments or family strapped to my ankles, i figured i had nothing to loose. The South Island city of Christchurch was to be my base for the next couplie years, and what a great choice that turned out to be (seriously).
  
 

  **Phase 2 - Christchurch - 2020**
  
 

  Moving somewhere new is filled with enough excitement and uncertainty that is bound to distract you from your ailments for a limited time. I moved to Christchurch to study construction management for a couple of years, with the thought being that they get rolled by earthquakes, so their construction knowledgebase must be fantastic, so surely there are worse places to pick to go and study. Two strange things happened - i was right, and on the first night in town i got woken up by an earthquake at 4am.
  
 

  I continued to ride, albeit less frequently because there was more effort involved in going on day rides than was involved previously, plus i had zero mates and knew nobody in Christchurch. I knew that would be the trade off to invest in myself, so i took up reading and going to F45 in lieu of bike riding as much as i was. Still fit as a fiddle and as active as i could be with poor sleep, i never joined the dots between strenuous exercise and poor/no sleep.
  
 

  With studying comes a college support network on offer to help students get the most out of their time at campus and into work. Counselors and psychologists were free to a certain extent if you were full time, so for the first time in my life, i went to go and see both. There were frustrations with share housing at the time which i wont go into, suffice to say i allowed this person to enrage me which did not help. The councilor and psychologist offered their thoughts and opinions, and then referred me to the GP. Hey presto, the word Quetiapine was bough up again, as well as Norpress and some other anti-depressant which i cant remember.
  
 

  I took the GP's advice on good faith and tried these for another 3-4 months at which point i was told to increase the dosage to get the same effects, which i did. Sure enough the tolerance went up along with the daily drowsiness, resulting in a reduced interest in daily life. The poor sleep never really left and increased as the tolerance went up. If i wanted to do as well as i wanted to at school, including attendance as one of my goals (which i got 98% somehow), this medication shit had to stop. This was feeling ever increasingly like a band-aid fix, with addressing or identifying the root cause/issue not being discussed.
  
 

  My turn to take the reigns. The medication stopped. I was hoping to get employment in construction finance and estimating/tendering, so surely a few quick clalc's on how much i spent on GP's and the like would be easy enough. I was of the opinion that if i invested the same or more into books on the topic i was battling against, as what i spent on GP's in one year, i would end up saving time and a shit load of money, so that's what i did.
  
 

  I then cold called a bunch of psychologists, trying to get an appointment. I was able to book one, and saw her for 3 sessions at my own expense. She was great and thought i had anxiety, which makes sense and i don't doubt that one iota. She referred me to a breathing workshop - i arrived at the breathing appointment with a lady who i soon realized i was paying to teach me how to breathe. That one hour appointment lasted about 15 minutes before i walked out - too far down the rabbit hole. The last thing ill do is pay someone to teach me how to breathe, surely that's taking the piss and is not the solution, yet merely a symptom of an issue i want to understand and want resolved.
  
 

  I went back to the psychologist with honest feedback and requested she refer me to the psychiatrist, because if i was to entertain any further opinions, i was only open to highly qualified professionals who had seen likely similar and far more serious patients run their course and as such could tell me why, so i could understand what i had to do, so as to not have why being a concern any longer. Yes this cost me a lot of time, disruption and money while being a student (further stress due to no income), however i sold it to myself that investing in myself was a small price to pay if i wanted to have a solid crack at getting and retaining sound employment for a good career. This was to be (and still is) my final obstacle. And its a c\*\*t. 6 months later from seeing the psychologist it was said that i have social anxiety. More medication was prescribed, and the same pattern as previously endured repeated itself, which i bought to an end after 6 months of seeing to the psychiatrists recommendations. To no avail. Square one - yes welcome back.
  
 

  I don't advise anyone to delve too far down the rabbit hole of mental health, as the more you learn about how the mind works and immerse yourself in everything that topic has to offer, in the search of your own bread crumbs to help you make an educated guess, the more you realize that to improve your focus in life, you have to cut out the noise. A lot of noise comes from family and friends (opinions, commentary and generally unproductive time wasting crap), which further leads to frustration and isolation, which is where i am now. I have an almost zero tolerance for opinions, media waffle, chortle or life commentary based on the time i have allowed myself to entertain it previously.
  
 

  Summing up Christchurch - i love the people. I am glad i chose to go there, and i know so so so much more about construction than i did previously, and i owe that to the people who gave up their time to be teachers. Too much (Tumeke). I had to leave Christchurch when the borders got closed 18 months ago as an uncle was dying of cancer. I made the decision to pack all my belongings and vehicle into storage and quite literally got the last plane out of New Zealand around 18 months ago to be able to say goodbye to uncle chook. I finished my studies online and was 'stranded' in Melbourne, so i decided to get a job.
  
 

  **Phase 3 - Melbourne (Home) 2021-2022**
  
 

  Among my reading travels, i saw a Garmin Fenix 6X Pro come up for sale, half price, which monitors everything except your neighbors cats hair length. The main criteria to track was my sleep, which this watch offered. I was also introduced to the term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) courtesy of this watch.
  
 

  My morning Melbourne routine consisted of going for 20km road ride in the dark each morning when my sleep permitted, and going to F45 in the morning or afternoon when my sleep and energy level permitted also. It was only recently that i began to, with the aid of the watch as a pencil, start to join the dots on what was potentially effecting my lack of sleep based on the data i now had available. (Yes i am aware of the placebo effect, however these sleep issues had been around previously - to combat placebo, i would wear the watch for a month of two, then take it off for around a month and then put it on again to get an average gist of what the go might have been).
  
 

  Long story short, my watch measures HRV on a scale of 0-100, with 0 being extremely relaxed, and 100 being completely fight or flight. What i noticed is that if my HRV had not come down to a reading of below 20 for at least 2 hours on average before bed (10:00pm), there would be a very high chance that i would not sleep heavily or at all that night. So to work backwards - what was causing my HRV to not only spike to 95 during any form of exercise, but to stay PINNED at 75-95 up to 8 hours after i had ceased any form of activity? This HRV reading could be as high as 90 if i was sitting on the couch 6-8 hours after having gone for a beginner/intermediate paced ride with zero elevation and generally no due stress along the way. A cause for concern, definitely.
  
 

  The question whittled down to - what is it inside of us that allows the HRV to return to a level of relaxation after being so high? what is broken inside of me that wont allow myself to calm down and better yet, what do i have to do to strengthen that function so that i can return to an active lifestyle, courtesy of sleep quality having been restored?
  
 

  I have books for Africa (figure of speech), and the most recent one i bought is called 'The Body Keeps The Score', written by Dr. Bessel Van Der Kolk (Penguin Books). I will gladly pay cash money for a piece of work that someone has taken the time to compile for the benefit and or entertainment of others, so i added it to the stack. In the 30+ books i have on the similar topic of mental health, this book is the only one which explains in plain English what the function of the amygdala plays in engaging both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system - a pure coincidence that i happened to have HRV data and Sleep History logged on my watch that was able to be reviewed.
  
 

  My understanding of the parasympathetic nervous system and therefore HRV is as follows:
  
 

  \-Sympathetic nervous system: Allows your heart rate to increase in response to a threat or form of stress - be it exercise or being chased by someone whom you would rather not be chased by for example. Or it could be your body's reaction to stressful thoughts/dreams about past events (PTSD) or future events (anxiety into avoidance).
  
 

  \-Parasympathetic nervous system: your body's ability to calm down after said strenuous event has passed - as in, the threat is no longer there so your heart rate drops and your body can calm down.
  
 

  HRV: how well your para/sympathetic nervous system responds to stressors both before, during and after. People with a high heart rate variability can likely run a marathon and then 30 mins later go home to bed and can get restorative sleep for 8-10-100 hours?. People with a low heart rate variability can go for a 5km light/moderate walk and be sitting at home feeling like they have just run the Boston marathon still 5 hours after they finished their light walk around the local neighborhood area.
  
 

  **Summary**
  
 

  So my question now becomes this:
  
 

  Years ago, i could go for a ride for up to 50km a day, and clock over 1500m of elevation, and come back home and be absolutely fine, i loved it, and i would sleep like a rock. You bet i would continue to do that because i felt amazing. So what would have to change so that the parasympathetic nervous system now does not seem to function at all, and moreover, what steps do i have to take to engage the parasympathetic nervous system so that i can increase its response post exercise and start not having to worry about sleep and return to an early morning routine, essentially restoring quality of life once more?
  
 

  I do keep a good attitude about it all, and although it cant get much worse, I'm sure that for someone else it probably is worse. It is a journey that i wouldn't wish on my worst enemies, not that i have any of them. Interesting is a word that comes to mind when i have reached out to mates and told them about the shit time im having, with the lack of interest returned the only action i take note of. You really do get to see who truly stands out in a time of need, which can only serve to make life's travels less of a waste of time, so therefore its a kind of good thing? i think?
  
 

  Yes that's the brief version - if you got to this bit and you're in Melbourne, my shout. Oh and i don't drink either if you are wondering - screws up my sleep even more.
  
 

  Thanks

"My spouse (37M) and I (41F) deal with depression and anxiety. We are both on several medications. We both have full time jobs, but money is tight. He keeps applying for jobs that will pay a little more, has interviews, but keeps getting turned down. 
  
 

  This constant rejection has had a very severe impact on his mental health, and now he won't stop talking about how the world would be better off without him and he should ""blow \[his\] brains out."" I know from multiple experiences that our local mental health hospital is a joke, so to take him there for a 72 hour hold would only cause more money issues and not help his mental situation at all.
  
 

  I'm looking for advice on how to deal with him, as it is having its own effects on my mental health."
"Lately I (50f) have been having a lot of intrusive thoughts. This has only happened once or twice before in my life. 
  
 

  These horrific pictures just keep flashing in my brain. The past few weeks have been very stressful and the next 4 are lining up to be. 
  
 

  I made an appointment with a therapist but it's not for a couple of weeks. In the meantime, how do I cope?"
I'm 50 and for a number of months I have been suffering with crippling anxiety. My GP on the rare occasions I get to speak to a doctor doesn't seem want to prescribe anything other than mild beta blocker for the physical symptoms. Has anyone got any recommendations for medication that has worked for them?
I'm having a lot of issues with my wife. Our marriage is troubled and it basically all to do with mental health. When we're both healthy and getting needs met it great! I love being married. That's rarely the case lately though. We're both struggling so hard with life. I just want to die and so does she. I don't know how to break the cycle.
"Hi folks, I’m a 45yo guy living with severe anxiety for a year. I’ve had some level of chronic anxiety most of my life but since I had a health scare and quit my “crutch” - alcohol last year, it’s gone into overdrive. Had all kinds of tests last year, wore a heart monitor for a month, had cat scan with contrast, MRI, etc - they say my heart is fine, or at least was a year ago. I deal with chest pains, palpitations (these freak me the heck out), dizziness, headaches, muscle tension especially upper body, hyperventilation, the works. I got .25mg Xanax from my doc. I break it in half because the whole tablet makes me way drowsy and I need to be able to function somewhat and work, etc. I use it sparingly, but if I wind up taking the second half over the course of the day, I’m wrecked tired and drowsy by 4/5 pm, and my anxiety is still not in a great spot. So the Xanax takes some of the edge off, but I hate taking it. I’ve been avoiding SSRIs mainly because of the side effects that I’ve heard about, and many of them are supposed to be sexual - which sucks. 
  I’m getting pretty desperate as this anxiety has robbed me of a year of my life in which I wasn’t able to be happy or enjoy my children, my wife — my family.
  
 

  Have SSRIs helped you with anxiety specifically? I don’t have chronic depression issues, although being anxious so often has gotten me down on many occasions. 
  Which meds helped you, and what side effects did you experience? I’d welcome anything you’d be willing to share about your SSRI journey. 
  
 

  Thank you!"
"I’ve been seeing a therapist for a year. She’s a wonderful person, and she’s helped me a lot. I’ve been feeling lately that I’m just not getting enough help from her. We’re kind of stagnant. There’s not much more delving into things, or trying anything new. She basically lets me vent and we go over some of the things we’ve previously discussed. I’m relatively new to therapy. Almost a year and first therapist.
  
 

  Did you have a similar experience where you felt that you’ve reached the end of the road (like the boyz 2 men song)? What was next for you? Did you find another therapist and did they help? Please share your experience, as much as you feel like. Thank you!"
My anxiety is through the roof I keep putting off going to the doctors as I feel he or she will just fob me off. I am truely anxious about the state of this war and all these threats of nuclear war not to mention the cost of living and energy prices now I know people are harsh and laugh it off but I myself am not a teenager am an adult who also has a family. I sometimes wonder was it worth it. I mean I know I couldn't predict was was going to happen in the future but I fear for there future OK there not little children but there still young adults 20+ it just breaks my heart that the world has become so unstable of late with covid and now this I feel for the people off course I do but because of world leaders they have made such a mess of all our futures if we have one at all.
"I have an emotion support dog. I’m overly attached to her. She truly is my best friend. She’s a purebred Siberian Wooly husky. They require lots of play and exploring. Most days my depression and anxiety are so bad I can’t even walk her. She has a huge yard to roam, and she goes out a lot but mostly just lays in the sun. She doesn’t play with toys. She’s into bones. In the house she doesn’t leave my side. Sometimes I feel like a huge failure to her,almost like she deserves more. I don’t know how I’d live without her. Anyone else feel this?"
"I (50f) have an appointment with a psychologist at the end of the month. Im starting to get nervous and wanting to cancel.
  I've never been to a psychologist before and I'm afraid I wont be able to open up to them.
  I've always had trouble expressing my feelings.
  
  Does anyone know what I can expect to happen"

"Hello,
  
 

  I'm struggled with mental health issues for as long as I can remember, recently a co-worker said I remind her of her son who has ADHD and I should look into it (not in an impolite way).
  
 

  I started googling around and found a thread about people's symptoms. I thought I'd create a list of similar attributes to see what people thought? If possible let me know what you think, I know it's a bit long, so thank you for reading if you do!
  
 

  Something is going on with me, I'm not sure if it's depression, anxiety. I'm getting older now. I'd like to try to get some of this resolved if at all possible.
  
 

  The good:
  
 

  I've held a good steady job for a long time
  
 

  I've held a fitness routine for a long time
  
 

  I'm clean and tidy
  
 

  I'm not impulsive, if anything I'm incredibly risk averse.
  
 

  I'm patient and understanding
  
 

  I've been in a relationship for a long time.
  
 

  The Bad
  
 

  The number one thing is I've never had a purpose, never wanted anything. I've always felt lost and directionless. I don't chase anything. I just am. I can agree or disagree, but I cannot really fill a vision board if I tried. I could do things, or I could not, I wouldn't care either way.
  
 

  Ironically I don't know if I am indecisive, but I tell myself that I don't care either way
  
 

  Organization | Terrible I think. I am not organized, but I'm tidy if that makes sense? I don't really understand this. Like if you open my drawers, it's spaghetti, but the top of the desk is clean?
  
 

  Rejection sensitivity, I interpret unspoken body language as rejection. This has been a huge hurdle in my relationship as I'm constantly monitoring my partners body language for rejection. I voluntarily walk on egg shells so I don't ""do the wrong thing"".
  
 

  I struggle with hearing people properly.
  
 

  If I'm having a conversation and there's a loud noise, even though I can ""hear"" the conversation, the noise is all my brain interprets and the other person may as well be speaking a different language.
  
 

  I struggle with difficult manuals that are ""too hard""
  
 

  I struggle with easy manuals as they are ""too easy"" so I skim and miss important things. I often have to take apart things I've built because I missed a key detail early on.
  
 

  I make careless mistakes in emails and creative writing even when re-reading them.
  
 

  Only motivation for what I enjoy, and the pool is getting smaller as I get older.
  
 

  I was a smart child, but never applied. I took easy courses so I would get good grades.
  
 

  When I went to college I simply couldn't keep up/understand the workload. I was easily frustrated and quick to give up. I was bored in lectures. If I didn't just attempt to write what the professor spoke word for word, I wouldn't retain any information at all.
  
 

  Leaving college made me feel like a failure and I've felt like a failure ever since.
  
 

  I will work out every day, but I won't build a meaningful progressive routine.
  
 

  I thrive on routines and discipline and deviations cause me huge amounts of stress.
  
 

  I WILL clean up, but only set tasks that I know how to do. I won't branch out and start cleaning the shower, since I never do.
  
 

  If cleaning the shower becomes a part of my routine or I am asked, I will then do it.
  
 

  Mentally my life is a big checksheet. I forget some things, but I cannot relax or even allow myself to rest until ""my checklists"" are done. No matter how tired.
  
 

  I do things according to checklists to keep me safe. To make sure I'm doing life ""right""
  
 

  I make huge excel checklists, then procrastinate at anything that can't be completed instantly. I try breaking things down into smaller chunks, then again, if there's anything that takes a long time, I just push it further down until I have to do it.
  
 

  I need exact instructions for things at work. Vague things frustrate me.
  
 

  I never hear people at first, then I say ""pardon"" then it turns out I did hear them. My brain needed to catch up
  
 

  I will finish everyone's sentences. People tell me I talk very fast. I get incredibly frustrated with slow talkers.
  
 

  When people talk to me, I don't always listen instead, I'm planning my response.
  
 

  Anxiety if plans change. I can't cope. Unless someone is cancelling plans, in which case I'm relieved
  
 

  I'm tired all the time. ALL THE TIME. I wake up tired.
  
 

  Anxiety about hanging out with people I like.
  
 

  If I wake up and I'm anxious in the night, I'll keep myself awake by imagining sliding door scenarios. I can do this for hours. In the morning it's all meaningless.
  
 

  Sometimes I dream about real life. Like going to work etc... then I have troubles differentiating between things I did in the dream and what's real. For example, I dream that Sue needs me to fix a document, so I'll walk over to Sue and as I'm walking I'll realize she doesn't need help, it was a dream. My dreams are hyper realistic. If I have a bad dream, It affects my mood all day even though it wasn't real, I have a hard time emotionally separating.
  
 

  Huge focus on sex and sexuality and if I'm not getting it, I don't feel loved. I feel like a loser. When we do have it, I don't actually enjoy it. I'm constantly thinking ""am I touching this right, doing this right"". Like a game I'm trying to get the most points at. It's hugely stressful for me.
  
 

  Constantly comparing my life to others, people I don't know and stories I read. I often attempt to squeeze and compare online stories to my life.
  
 

  I don't feel like I have a personality, I just take bits and pieces from what I see other people do that I like or that other people respond positively to. When I was younger I attempted to be like my brother who was just effortlessly cool. When I did the things he did, they were awkward and cringey. Other people can see this. I feel like I do the same things he does, but they don't... work for me? Like I could go to open the door for someone, but I push and it's a pull door, so I can't open it and I'm getting flustered and it was clearly labelled, and then I think of that interaction constantly for the rest of my life.
  
 

  I don't feel like an adult. I feel like a child pretending to be an adult and I'm just waiting for ""gotcha"" when everyone else figures it out. I feel like a fake at my job and I'm just waiting to be fired. Ironically this doesn't motivate me to learn more, study or work harder.
  
 

  I procrastinate so much on things that I promise I'll do. I made a new years resolution that was very quick and easy. I haven't done it all year.
  
 

  I have trouble staying awake in face-to-face meetings. This is one of the hardest things I have to do in my life. I can't emphasize this enough.
  
 

  I can't focus on virtual meetings, I need to be doing something in the background. I'll turn off the camera and play on my phone then realize I needed to be paying attention, close the phone then repeat.
  
 

  When I'm waiting for something on a PC, I'll swap to doing something else
  
 

  I play multiple PC games at the same time to avoid game downtime load screens etc.
  
 

  I have huge problems focusing in meetings. I often get caught out and have to ask people to repeat what we're talking about.
  
 

  I have trouble staying awake driving home
  
 

  I arrive at work not knowing how I got there, daydreaming
  
 

  I daydream a lot as an escape. I retreat into fantasy where I have lots of money and don't have to work.
  
 

  I'm very creative, I can make games, books and stories in my head by just listening to music.
  
 

  I find myself disassociating a lot. I will force myself back into my body with breathing and touch. I'm getting better at this, but it doesn't seem to change anything. I often feel like I'm floating with my body, like everything is cloudy. I get moments of clarity where I feel ""normal"" and they're wonderful, but rare.
  
 

  I cannot study. I read, then rearead. It can take me many attempts to read and learn something. I will forget it very quickly regardless. I've read the same starter books over and over and each time the information feels new.
  
 

  If I attend a training course for work, I will not remember a single thing within a few weeks.
  
 

  I have in the past been able to read fiction books, when I remember them, it was like I was watching a movie. Not for a very very long time now.
  
 

  I have waiting anxiety. If there is something coming up that I have to do, I won't be able to do anything until that thing happens.
  
 

  I don't call my loved ones outside of my immediate family. I never call my brothers. I only call my dad out of guilt and I had to make a habit/time
  
 

  I will miss meetings even though I set them in my calendar. I will dismiss, telling myself I'll remember it, it's only in 15 minutes then start working on something and forget about the meeting.
  
 

  Someone will ask me to do something, I say I'll do it right away, then not do it and forget about it.
  
 

  What do I do about it?
  
 

  I take a mindfulness walk every day
  
 

  I meditate ever second or third day
  
 

  I workout, both strength training and cardio
  
 

  I attempt to keep good sleep hygeine. Same bed time every night, no screens directly before bed.
  
 

  I limit/avoid caffeine where possible (decaf drinks)
  
 

  I eat a very rigid healthy diet.
  
 

  I try to keep a mood journal
  
 

  I practice gratitude constantly.
  
 

  I practice diaphragmatic breathing.
  
 

  I've been to a few doctors, I've asked for a mental health plan, I go and talk to a psychologist and they just seem so.. unhelpful, they always start with the same things like mindfulness and breathing.. I just can't get past the barrier where I feel they understand what I'm talking about
  
 

  One GP prescribed me with anti-anxiety medication. I'm reluctant to take medication as I am functioning, I'm just a mess internally.
  
 

  So, I'm not sure where to go, I don't think my area is a good resource for mental health. Does this sound like ADHD? Anxiety? Depression? Halp!"
"Not sure but I feel like my mind is thinking of ways to scare me. I mean that’s what anxiety is right?
  
 

  
 

  So I came home and not sure if my weed hit too hard or it’s just my fear of contamination but feeling a bit anxious.
  
 

  So I been having a bit of anxiety when smoking sadly and I hear a lot are feeling the same. :( Used to feel pretty good but I should smoke less.
  
 

  I mopped at work today and came home and a bud touched my shirt but I wasn’t like covered in mop water but anxious about smoking a contaminant lol. Pretty silly huh? Anxiety sucks
  
 

  Then my arms felt weird and my head felt weird but just anxiety?? :("
"I was laughing with my friend and hit my head against the car headrest feel kinda weird…. Maybe it’s just the alcohol lol
  
 

  And maybe I’m just anxious right?? Random anxiety
  
 

  Haven’t drank in awhile"
"I know this sounds silly but after taking a dump I worried if I washed my hands good enough, then was rushing to work and took my meds?
  
 

  My brain is scaring me???"
"Feel embarrassed to say anything. Racist intrusive thoughts? Sigh been struggling with GAD and OCD and health anxiety too I guess.
  
 

  Basically this cool black guy came into work and seemed wholesome and talked about positivity and I gave him a fist bump before he left but he like touched my other hand and asked me a question and my hand felt weird and I worried if it was possible he like drugged me or something?
  
 

  Then I’m like: “wtf that’s a weird thought”
  
 

  I think my brain was looking for ways to scare me? And I’m not racist…. I think everyone has the potential to be a good person.
  
 

  WTF is wrong with me? Hypervigilance and over analyzing sensations??"
"Hello everyone, 47F and have Covid it’s day 9 thought I was getting better than I had a panic attack. My worst nightmare. 
  Went to the hospital for the chest pains because I couldn’t understand and scared about Covid 
  
 

  Everything was clear and the chest X-ray was good along with the blood work.
  
 

  I feel horrible and breathless. If anyone had Covid and got a panic attack how did you help yourself. I was given nothing 
  
 

  But I do get Ativan from my doc, I guess I’ll take that 
  
 

  Did anything help you guys Im open I’ve run out of options"
Distressing OCD thoughts also regular anxiety
How can I prevent anxiety crashes? I'm currently on sertraline and buporion which has helped with some other symptoms. My family doctor is of no help and I don't have access to a psychiatrist for months. I crash everyday for about an hour but yesterday was really bad. I walked in the door crashed on the floor and I did not move for 3 hours laying on the kitchen floor. After that I got up at 8:00 said hi to the family went to bed and couldn't sleep all night because I'm over tired now. I'm 45 I can't keep doing this I'm sure this is going to give me a heart attack. Should I go to the ER at this point to get help?
"I was in the basement and bumped my head on the dryer - but I couldn’t tell if I hit my headphones or head lol
  
 

  And then there’s this low hanging like vent thing and hit my head on that but again I don’t even know if it was my headphones or my head
  
 

  
 

  I had a headache before all this 
  
 

  
 

  I think I’m
  Fine IDK?"
"Maybe I was just anxious cuz the weed got me plus tired IDK but I laying down and I bumped my head and maybe I’m just high and tired but I thought I felt a weird sensation?
  
 

  Also I have a fear of getting injured I guess and I bumped my head months ago and the doc said if I felt any numbness or tingling to the ER. I don’t know if it was like a pulsing sensation… 
  
 

  So… what I’m asking is do we have a pulse in the back of our heads? Thought I felt something IDK?? Am I okay?
  
 

  Also I bumped my head 2x earlier today but once I thought I hit my headphones and the other something in the basement 
  
 

  
 

  Also I work in 2 hours :("
"Obviously I’m pretty sure it was a random intrusive thought but I got like 2 hours of sleep and I’m working with my coworker who is a bad person and had a thought like:
  
 

  &gt; What if she put like windex in my water or whatever 
  
 

  
 

  I know that’s kinda ridiculous but yeah she turned out be manipulative when I met her…. I’m not crazy right? 😔"
"Literally happened last nite and I bumped in other place in the house yesterday too
  
 

  Will I be okay? 😣"
"Always worry I might inhale it.
  
 

  I took my meds earlier and I’m pretty sure I swallowed correctly lol? I didn’t choke and yeah I wouldn’t be able to breathe if it was caught in my throat right??"
"More intrusive thoughts…
  
 

  I know reassurance is bad 😣
  
 

  Was at work and drank coffee cuz tired and saw this guy who can be a bit of an asshole and I wasn’t even talking to him but I had some thoughts of violence towards him :("
"So I was giving a customer their money back and it felt like they touched my finger…. Then my hand started feeling weird and I worried they were on drugs or something?
  
 

  Sigh, am I just being anxious? Then my shoulder started feeling weird
  
 

  :("

"It hurts me so much to see people go through what I go through but worse, so here are so compliments from a stranger on the internet with anxiety (I got some of these for google :D)!  
  
 

  
 

  You are so, so beautiful.

"I have a fear of being injured/dying and I didn’t even hit my head I like touched it against a shelf when putting things away at work and my mind was like:
  
 

  &gt; Am I okay
  
 

  And I got anxious but I’m not dizzy, didn’t fall over, loss consciousness, and I think I’m freaking myself out 
  
 

  Stupid stupid anxiety"
"I was taking a dump at work and well, some water splashed up into my
  Butt 😂
  
 

  And then some toilet water got on the paper I was wiping with… embarrassing but venting pretty sure I’m good tho
  
 

  Sorry I hope you all don’t have any bathroom anxiety shit…. No pun intended. I used to have a ton…. It’s sucks :(
  
 

  Got over it through simply having to go tho!"
I was using a sharpie and didn’t hold it up to my nose or anything but it smelled uhh strong? And I got worried cuz when I went a kid I think my teacher sniffed the markers and I did too…. Could that have fucked me up? lol
IDK I ate some hot Mac n cheese then I worried my throat hurt a bit also tired and high
I swallow an M&amp;M and some of my burger unchewed maybe…. Will I be okay??

"I had an intrusive thought about my coworker who is a bitch/bad person poisoning me but I’m being paranoid - I ate the food anyway cuz I know it’s anxiety but yeah 
  
 

  Help… I’m not responsible for my
  Thoughts but… :("
Am I okay? Could be the weed making me notice sensations more maybe my neck needed to crack??
"“Many if not all serial killers had bad childhoods”
  
 

  Don’t remember much but I don’t remember being traumatized and I take pride in being a good person… I think my OCD is acting up - intrusive thoughts and that comment scared me… but my family is definitely mentally ill"
"I finally am able to sleep but I think my health anxiety is kicking in. I was taking off my sweatshirt in bed and took off one arm first lol and thought it hit myself in the head with my fist or something fucking dumb like that?
  
 

  Wow I sound silly - health anxiety scaring me?? No need to see doc right"
"I sat down to take a dump and scratches my butt (bad I know) and then inadvertently touched my
  face/nose area IDK?
  
 

  And I worried about like getting sick or an infection? Anxiety freaking me out right? I rinsed my face with water also I’m at work"
[removed]
I think I did and I got anxious lol
"First I worried about cleanliness and a bottle of Comet, then I plucked the metal safety device off a lighter and saw some metal fly and worried it I got any in my eye, then I just felt anxious and worried I’d never get better IDK
  
 

  Sounds like my GAD is kicking my ass 
  
 

  See how your thought process can go deeper and deeper 😢"
I know reassurance is bad can I have a tiny bit that will help??
"I am 42 years old and lately I was ruminating how different I am today from the person I was in my teens and twenties. I had severe, almost crippling social anxiety, rarely any friends, couldn't communicate to peers or other people. I was so incredibly lonely and trapped inside myself. I was constantly depressed and could have never imagines the person I would grow into. It is a difference of night and day. Today I am outgoing, chatty, socially extremely successful and am liked by colleagues and friends alike. People usually describe me as vibrant, always laughing, and infectious with positivity. It took many, many hard years to get here, but I made it. Granted, it feels like my social anxiety morphed into a different kind of panic disorder, but people and interactions are not a problem anymore, rather a skill I excel at. And it all comes very naturally to me, there is no faking it.
  
 

  If you are annoyed by now, please don't be. Not here to toot my own horn, but I wanted to report on a good outcome. Especially in light of so many stories from young people writing they are so lonely and desperate. There is always hope and improvement is possible!
  
 

  You. Are. Awesome. And you deserve all the good quality social interactions that will eventually come into your life! Never give up!! You. Got. This."


"Has anyone else experienced severe and uncontrollable urges to touch things around you repeatedly during a sever anxiety attack? I have experienced this only 3 times in my life, but it was always so, so scary... it's like a joke, first I lose control of my mind (anxiety) and then of my body (uncontrollable touching behavior). It is one of the worst experiences of my life, complete and utter powerlessness."
"Aaaarrrggghhh. I am so stressed out. I've neen having these overly ""adventurous"" dreams bordering on nightmares for weeks now. I wake up during the night a couple of times completely stressed and wet from sweating. I don't get why this is happening. I don't have an anxiety phase during the day right now, it seems my anxiety has shifted to the nights?? WTF"
"Uhh
  
 

  
 

  
 

  Feeling a bit better from earlier yeah sometimes (oftentimes) anxiety can grow and grow and “what if…”
  
 

  I was watching a video of a stroke victim who couldn’t pronounce words last nite and I started doing that (WTF brain) and I worried I was having a stroke but I think 😂😂 but my brain was mimicking the guy like….??????"
"This last week I had a bad time with panic attacks, I had four panic attacks over 6 days and was tense with shaking, I felt sick, spaced out and exhausted and could not relax.
  I had my first panic attack when I was 18 years old while smoking weed, and have had anxiety all my life I am 42 now.
  
 

  Over the years I have self medicated by drinking when it was bad and that brought with it more problems.I also had good years when I was fine and didn't take anything. 
  
 

  These last two years have been hard for me I had a panic attack when I had my first Covid Vaccine in 2021 and I got tinnitus from it that has never gone away, My anxiety has gotten worst since that day, I also caught Covid in December and had horrible Panic attacks because I couldn't breathe.
  
  It has been slowly getting worst with health anxiety untill this last week when I had the worst panic attack I have ever had and I just couldn't take it anymore and went to the doctor's, She prescribed 0.25mg of Xanax to take once a day for 5 days, and booked me an appointment with a psychologist. I took one and went to bed and felt much better when I woke up like a switch had been flicked, 
  
 

  After reading up about Xanax I am not sure if I should take it again
  Should I take it every day for 5 days or wait a few days before taking another one?"
Was doing great really high experienced smoker then got paranoid in public and worried if it was possible anyone could poison me without me knowing them I worried about my weed being poisoned by someone when In the store?? WTF? Stupid brain
WTF? I’m taking a dump and I saw like spots or stars for a sec…
"So two days ago I posted my life's ""success story"" to counterweight the overwhelming negative stories here and to give some hope to others. It seemed to be a hugely popular post and I got only positive feedback. While I am super glad about this, I also wanted to add that my life is far, far from perfect and a full success.
  
 

  I still have reverberations from my past social anxiety. Yesterday during a meeting I dared voicing an unpopular opinion and everyone blew up about it. Although I am very unapologetic about it, I still felt like a horrible castout again... my self confidence plummeted for a moment there and I ruminated too much about the criticism.
  
 

  I failed my complete first studies. I was a mess (anxiety plus severe depression). I tried a second time years later, it was hell (but I succeeded) and I was left highly indebted.
  
 

  Whenever my environment changes (i.e. job change), I completely lose it and have a breakdown with severe anxiety episodes needing pharmacological treatment. Every. Single. Time. I am moving flats? Breakdown. I lose a relationship? Breakdown.
  
 

  I never succeeded in leading a ""standard"" life with husband and kids, I have neither. This feels like a huge, massive failure still."
"WTF. I am really stressed out. Never in my life have I dreamt I was killing someone, let alone with my bare hands. I can't seem to shake off these vivid dreams about super out of character topics, it's been going on for weeks and I've absolutely had it. Full blown anxiety the whole night, waking up sweating like a pig."
"I am experiencing this strange symptom. Whenever I'm in a bright room and from there I come to a darker room I see dark patches in upper peripheral vision. When I look up it disappears.im not sure what this is, but started experiencing these after I was put on anxiety meds.
  At this point I don't experience it much but still curious"
"Hi I have a fear of contamination and I was grabbing a paper towel and noticed there was some Comet next to it, then rubbed my eyes and worried about Comet in my eyes??
  
 

  Probably overthinking right? My eyes would burn right lol?
  
 

  Just rinsed them well with cold water in the bathroom"
I had them in my pocket while taking a dump also my pants may have gotten wet while washing but I think I’m overthinking
"Sigh. There’s this creepy guy who comes into work (I’m a guy, just seemed overly nice, don’t know him) and I had my water bottle in the back room and he was there for a bit and I worried if he poisoned it?
  
 

  I mean is my fear really that far off"
"It’s super late trying to sleep, very tired and high and I hear a noise and there’s a mouse under my bed!! 😨
  
 

  Ahhh! There was a stupid fucking cookie piece!?! Don’t even remember when I ate one! :(
  
 

  It won’t crawl on me or bite during sleep right?? Cleaning tomorrow"
"Hello everyone. I am 47F soon to be 48. 
  I had a pretty bad Covid and I was wondering if there’s things you should check after covid.
  
 

  Also being almost 48. I do have some type of hot flashes. I have a history of panic attacks and it’s like Covid brought it all out now.
  
 

  I don’t know what to do or how to seek help!? I had my last blood work done last year. And was recently the hospital so I had the basic CBC etc 
  
 

  
 

  Should I ask for d-dimer?"
Umm… I was using the microwave and the food got hot and I opened it (over the range) and I was worried about radiation but just anxiety right? Or something affecting my brain 😔
I’m working with my bitchy coworker who I think is a bad person and I’m probably overthinking but there was a bottle of windex by my coffee I worried she poisoned me but intrusive thoughts? Had similar paranoia before :(
How can I get over this fear I worried my bitchy crazy coworker who talks to herself may have but I also have anxiety and :(
"Hello, everyone female 47 wanted to test my hormones for the first time. I’ve had a few off periods but it looks like I’m back on track. 
  
 

  I wanted to know as a 47 year old women what specific blood tests should I ask for.
  
 

  
 

  In general I suffer from anxiety, vertigo and lower back pain.
  
 

  I never had lower back pain before , I was at the chiropractor on Dec. he cracked my lower back pain and since then I’ve been having pain on and off. It sucks. Does anyone know what will help with that?
  
 

  My last doc checkup was last June. And I had recent blood tests"
"Sorry if I grossed any of you out… was very stressed at work and took 3m to do a uhh super wank and just did it right in the toilet….
  
 

  
 

  Wasn’t trying to be weird etc :(

So… I know this sounds really dumb but I was worried I might’ve gotten mop water in my mouth but I’m probably being a fucking hypochondriac… Do you have any advice besides reassurance? How can I calm myself down

  Anxiety about getting injured"
"Hello I've had anxiety progressively getting worse for 7 years and now is at its peak. I got diagnosed last year and I was put on sertraline and I'm currently at a dose of 200 mg a day. Two days ago my doctor said let's try something as I'm still crashing and having panic attacks. I'm currently taking .5 mg ativan every 3 to 4 hours and I feel amazing. I can focus I'm up and doing things I feel fantastic and not once did I feel the onset of a crash or any tingling sensations. And I slept oh my God I slept. That said how long is this sustainable? I know it can be addicting but thankfully addiction doesn't take hold of me no matter what it is. If the sertraline is working okay but the Ativan is completely knocking it out and making me normal what other medications out there that I could take long-term? Therapy is an option but it's mostly genetic which is been in the history of my family, first cousins and second cousins we all have anxiety. A mother and sisters also have clinical anxiety. Thanks for reading"
"So uhh I smoked a little bit of weed at work (too much I guess?) And I was thinking the girl was cute in a normal ‘kids are adorable 😊”
  
 

  Then I accidentally looked at the girl’s chest region and I feel gross 😔
  
 

  And I posted this earlier and got downvoted"
I think my mind is just overthinking but I smoked and earlier I mopped at work and I worried I smoked mop water residue maybe I’m just tripping cuz I had a bad day 😅

"I'm 53 years old, pretty much dealt with anxiety my whole life. I was the kid that went home sick pretty much every first day of school. Took many years to realize what it was. 
  Never been married, never really had any serious girlfriends. But now it's getting to the point where I'm having a hard time even working. Been doing food deliveries for the last year, and I can't get myself over the hump to get a better paying job before I get evicted.
  Maybe part of it's just getting older and feeling it, but I don't have the confidence that I even had in small amounts before. It's like I know I need to do something, but I'm in mud. Somewhat depressed probably about it, but I don't know. Just looking for advice, anyone else dealing with anything like that? Take care, God bless."

"It seems like they do. Gossip is really popular. And some people seem like they have no OFF switch for their judging. Like it's just a reflex or such a habit they can't help doing it, even critiquing small details about strangers. What do they get out of doing this? Some small bit of smug satisfaction? Some feeling of superiority perhaps? We say ""don't judge"" but I'm not sure it's so easy to stop doing if you've been doing it for a long time."
I like it because it is often more convenient and faster than waiting behind customers at a cashier. But sometimes I'll go to the cashier if there's no wait.
"So from College to present day I've always been anxious of things I'm not comfortable or familiar with and would tend to have to only do these thing once a couple days or week to prepare. Social situations are the worst but recently, I dont know what, something has changed.
  
 

  It started with going for my haircut, I dont suit short hair and so keep it long but not fully over ears long. However, the barber said what she was going to do and instead cut it really short. Usually I would panic about this, as this exact thing has happend before, but this time i didn't, I was totally relaxed. 
  
 

  Another, I planned to go alton towers with friends I havent talked to since high school, usually I would worry about how they've changed, if they will like me, what they think of me but I didn't think about this at all. Even the roller coasters i didn't fear, the most extreme coaster I've been on before alton towers was a 2 minute ride that is a little fast with some small drops. I ended up going on all the big rides including the smiler, oblivion and nemesis. Oblivion has me worry a little but I think that was fear of the unknown more than anything, a 55m verticle drop it a pit is a little worrying.
  
 

  Now as I'm writing this, I've just missed my train stop and in the middle of nowhere at some industrial stop and I'm nothing but relaxed. This type of thing would make me so unbelievably anxious, I tend to plan everything when traveling going over it every minute.
  
 

  Hoenstly it is so nice being in this state of mind and not caring about anything."
"I think shame plays a big role in this social anxiety stuff. If you don't feel good about yourself and you're worried about what others think of you, there has to be some shame going on, wouldn't you say? But being aware of shame is tricky. It's not pleasant to look at. We'd rather bury it or pretend it didn't exist. It's a painful feeling, this shame. Not sure what to do about it."

"I'm 52 and,if you can believe it, having my first ever girl's night next month. I have social anxiety that has kept me a loner for most of my life. I've hung out with the other two women, but only with our husbands, never alone. What does one talk about on a girl's night? I have a tendency to make things awkward because I'm nervous."
"It causes trouble anyway and makes things hard. Once or twice in the past I decided not to go into work, was feeling depressed or whatever, or then got into drinking, then got paranoid about using the phone to make an excuse or tell them I'd be missing my shift... and ended up getting fired."
"Does this make sense to you? Can you relate?

  I was a very socially awkward child. I never quite ""got"" this thing that everyone else around me somehow understood by some innate knowledge--how to socialize. I worked SO hard at it, and manage well now, overall. I'm 55.  
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  It wasn't until the past few years that I realized that at least one of the reasons for this is that what people say out loud and what their body language says does not agree. I am more in tune with what I see that what I hear (I still need to see things in writing to really learn or fully understand it), and I get these FEELINGS about people that end up being more accurate than not. I'm not talking about a 6th sense thing--just that my brain takes in information on different levels visually and auditorily and tells me what's really going on.
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  Whether taking things very literally or avoiding people because I didn't quite feel right about how to proceed in an acceptable social manner, this has caused me a lot of anxiety.

  I live in the UK now, where I find it MUCH easier to cope. Here, people more often say what they mean. People don't invite you into their home unless they really mean it, for example, as opposed to where I grew up in the Midwest US, where it was just polite to tell people to stop in any time--and then be horrified when you actually do.
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  i do think our brains are all wired differently, but for those of us who kind of get things on a different level, it's very anxiety provoking to hear one thing and see it (even subconsciously) on another level.

  I had a follow up appt with a doctor today, after a previous episode of anaphylactic shock (no known cause). I expected her to say, ""we'll do skin prick tests to see if we can figure out the cause,"" etc. 
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  Instead, she said she wants to refer to on to a ""specialized"" specialist immunologist, as my symptoms sound like a very different disease. It's very very rare (and it's unusual here to find anyone willing to look into rare disorders), and while some symptoms can be treated, it's not really a treatable (and definitely not a curable) disease. I'm trying not to panic.  
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  The disease explains ALL of the symptoms I've been experiencing for YEARS, but the outlook isn't all that great. Normal life span (unless you're one of the few 1 in a million with the extreme disease), but it means not much will get better, overall.  
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  I told a friend about it tonight (still not telling anyone closer to me) and said, at least it's not HIV...to which she responded, but at least HIV is treatable. In a very nice way, mind. She meant it (which is how I took it) as a way of supporting the fears around this. 
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  HOW do you not panic when finding out you're going to be tested for a rare disease that is not treatable???? I need a bit of help in this! (anaphylactic shock is possible at any time, without warning, and yes, I have epipens). Still....the thought of almost dying again is terrifying. And it's not like I can sim;ply avoid certain allergens--ANYTHING could cause this to happen again.

"Obsessive thinking is another symptom of anxiety. I obsess over times long gone, mainly about women.

"This would be common for you social anxiety sufferers out there. If maybe you haven't heard of the *spotlight effect* well it is basically the sense that all eyes are on you, that others are paying close attention to you. A tough thing to deal with as you feel like an actor on a stage with an audience full of tough critics. Or just one critic, an innocent nearby person even who your crazy brain has decided must be judging your words and actions. 
  
 

  It's a sort of paranoia I guess."
"And you probably didn't know it usually. Or maybe you guessed it a few times. I find it's really hard to tell and can say I've only noticed it on a few occasions. Like, I recall somebody and go, yeah, most likely she/he was dealing with it too.
  
 

  I'm not sure what my point is. It's probably more common than we realize, and others probably have no idea you struggle with it. Maybe you worry it's visible? In most cases it isn't, but some behaviors are a clue. Not that we should be going around ""diagnosing"" people anyway."

I am 54 years old and 205 pounds. I’ve worked out in the gym and riding bikes since I was a teenager and am in great shape. At age 20 I started having anxiety and panic attacks. About 20 years ago I started taking Paxil 20mg a day. It worked excellent until about 6 months ago when the anxiety and depression starting rearing its ugly head. My doc thought maybe it was time to switch SSRI’s and try Celexa 20mg a day. I slowly weaned myself off of Paxil for about 3 months and then the last month started taking the Celexa 20mg a day dose. These last 3 months have been a living hell. I am in a constant brain fog and feel like I can’t get going. I also have daily headaches. Before this I rarely got a headache. I can barely get to the gym anymore because I have no energy. Then I’ll have a day where I feel 100% normal. The next day though it’s back to the brain fog and depression and headache. I can’t figure out if it’s the Celexa doing it or if it is just long term Paxil withdrawals that so many I’ve read about have had after being in it for many years. Anyone with a similar experience with these 2 SSRI’s or any other combinations I’d love to hear from you and what you did if anything to get through the mess. Or am I just barking up the wrong tree and my doc and I should be looking at something totally different for the cause?
I just started taking a magnesium supplement. It helps calm the anxiety. Sorta makes me tired too.
"Was a video I saw the other day (Dr Eric Berg) saying that nutritional yeast is good for calming anxiety. So I bought some today and threw a bit in my food.

I'm 59 and have suffered from depression and anxiety most of my life. I've received years of therapy and take meds for depression. Lately I've had an intense fear of death and what happens afterwards. The part that scares me is the feeling that my life is like being on a ride I can't pause which ends in death. The inevitability and certainty are freaking me out. Time is moving super slowly and every minute awake feels like an hour. Any thoughts or ideas to help me cope better?
"I'm sort of embarrassed about this, but anyway... I wouldn't go into a coffee shop because I know someone who works there, and just didn't want to be seen by him in there for some strange reason, but today I went in there to get a coffee and felt better afterwards. Man, the weirdness of social phobia is still a mystery to me."
"I (16F) have very severe paranoia and anxiety and have a drunk uncle who gets too close for my liking + exposure to sexual content young, and I’m absolutely terrified of men.

"all in title really. e.g tomorrow she has a hair appointment at 3.15pm. we also need to go out quickly and buy a coat tomorrow during the day. everyone wakes up at 8.30am so that around 7 hours before she needs to leave for her appointment. yet all i’ve heard for the past hour is how we can’t do anything during the day tomorrow, how she’ll miss her appointment if we do, how she’s not sure if we can even get my coat tomorrow, how we’ve got to plan to not go far during the day so she can be back for her appointment.
  
 

  it’s so so frustrating to me this way of thinking. we have HOURS- why let the whole day be ruined and cut short b one appointment which is a nice thin anyway?? i challenged her but she kept defending and maintaining that she will miss it unless we don’t do much tomorrow so she can leave in time. i feel envious of other family dynamics i’ve witnessed where everything is 1000000x more carefree :/ this is only one example of thousands from the past- an event in the late afternoon dictating the entire day for the family"

"Last week I (M52) had COVID and now my feeling of anxiety are elevated to the point I think I’m going to die. My physical symptoms were not severe when I was testing positive, a little worse than the flu. I’m fully vaccinated and still I was really sick for four days in total. I got back to work on Friday of last week. However, by far the worst symptom of COVID is the intense anxiety I’ve been having, and it has not subsided yet. I’m feeling like my life is coming to an end. I’m wracked with guilt that I will leave my partner without a husband and my kids without a father. I worry about everything now, irrational fears that seem insurmountable. Most of the fears are based in nothing, and I know that, but my level of panic is through the roof. All of my senses are telling me that I’m dying even though I know rationally that’s probably not true. Has anyone else experienced this level of post-COVID anxiety?"
"Well, I've been out of work since 2016. I was sick for a year or two. I've applied for a few jobs and had a few interviews in the past couple years.

"here's my story as I'm 52 and never had deeper anxiety issues in my life like the ones I'm dealing with now. Yes I've had health anxiety all of my life (for myself and my son even) and been cautious about my financial future/security, but nothing that ever persisted beyond a few days. I've had a few episodes where I sought out 2 or 3 psychotherapy sessions and I've been fine about things that brought me down. I've worked in New York City high finance and Silicon Valley startups and dealt with alot of stress at work for years at a time. 
  
 

  This year I had a medical situation in late June that broke the camels back since I thought I had cancer or was going to have a serious neurological condition. My nerves and anxiety were going up before this (since late May) but it wasn't until late June that I had a week long insomniatic period from it that I would describe as traumatic. It changed the way I felt about the medical system and my security within the world. I was hypersensitive to everything and hyperaroused to the point of not trusting anything. I would get adrenaline like jolts just as I drifted to sleep that would light up my arms and legs --and keep me up all night or afraid of becoming addicted to benzos. it was as if I was afraid of death. 
  
 

  2.5 months of lexapro and alot of medical exclusion tests later, and I'm better. Able to work and sleeping with melatonin. Not able to nap or get a full 8 hours but enough to function. Sometimes I feel very tired physically and emotionally from managing this much uncertainty for so long (5 months) but I do believe I know what my issue is and there is a procedure for it. It will be painful in and of itself and may spike back up my anxiety but here's where I am now:
  
 

  \- feel arm shakes often, can't see it, just feel it and when I get a transient dark thought from reading something, I can feel that something is released to cause it; what can I take to calm these arm nerves down?  
  
 

  \- sometimes when I try to nap, my heart goes up from low 60's, high 50's to 68 and I get spiked back up, not as bad as when this started with the adrenaline jolts, and has only happened once at night thank God, but I think this shows my central nervous system hasn't totally quieted down; I don't feel anxious /jitterly /restless like i used to but I get this transitory feelings of nerves; will it ever fully go back or is this the new me? ie one strong and serious anxiety is what it takes to make me a nervous person forever? did something get altered permanently in my brain?
  
 

  \- I think that feeling of nervy arms may be growing a bit so maybe my anxiety is going up again, some days are better than others
  
 

  \- my urinary frequency / overactive bladder seems affected by nerves as much as by my medical condition. won't fully know if a surgery will fully stop that. A THC gummy totally cut out a big brain signal causing me to go for an evening but the THC made me paranoid. 
  
 

  So aside from the small questions above: HAS ANYONE EVER GONE BACK TO BEING COMPLETELY THE SAME AND FULLY CALM AFTER A SERIOUS ANXIETY BOUT? The fact that I'm wondering is subtle anxiety in and of itself. I just can't believe one episode changed me this much -- sometimes I wonder if I'm developing a neurological condition and this is just the beginning.

  Several months ago, I went to urgent care for hives. While i was waiting, it progressed to my first ever episode of anaphylaxis (I couldn't swallow, but was breathing normally). They sent my by ambulance to the hospital after giving me two epi shots, Just in Case, as the normal procedure for severe allergic reactions is to watch for the very rare possibility of a second occurrence. I ended up have two more epi shots in the long ambulance ride.

  Anaphylactic shock, where I couldn't breathe, my O2 levels plummeted as did my blood pressure.

  7 injections in (including cortisone) and i stabilized. I stayed inpatient for 3 days. As i woke up with hives and had not eaten or drunk anything after waking up, the cause of the reaction is completely unknown. No obvious bites and i had not changed a thing in my house in months.

  When I finally lowered my meds, I started a strange sleeping pattern of staying up all night and sleeping all day. As I'm usually a night person anyway, it didn't bother me much, until I tried sleeping at my previous usual time of around 2 AM and couldn't sleep til the sun rose. it became more and more obvious that it was fear of sleeping alone at night that was causing this.

  2 weeks ago, I had friends stay for a week--and had no problems at all in going to bed by midnight or so. After 10 days of visitors and no sleep issues---here I am. Lying in bed until dawn at the very earliest before I can sleep.
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  What can i do to get over this? I woke the first night in a panic, remembering not being able to breathe and told myself I WOULD NOT ALLOW THIS to affect me long term. It was traumatic, but I could deal with it!
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  So here I am. not overly anxious (nervous, but not horribly), I carry my epipens at all times, and I sleep just fine--but only during the day. 
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  Luckily I don't have to work, so it doesn't impact me as much as if I did, but not getting out to see the sun and doing things with friends, getting to appointments, etc is getting really old!
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  Therapy is non existent here atm, and I'd rather try to figure it out on my own first in any case. 
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  Thoughts? Ideas? Any recommendations to try?"
"Sorry--very long! **SUMMARY:**

  **How do you feel supported and listened to when you are one who expresses their anxiety by repeating your worries over and over and over? (besides having someone to listen to the exact same thing 100 times with no change--I have my limits and my boundaries are appropriate and necessary for me).**  
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  The following is specifics/background info if you want to read it all!
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  I am surrounded by people with severe anxiety. They don't live nearby, but we communicate via whatsapp everyday (throughout the day) and I struggle at times to know what to do!
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  I have anxiety myself (treated, mostly successfully atm). My sister has never found any med that works for her, and she has tried them all. My partner consistently forgets to take his; it works when he remembers. These two are the main issue for me.
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  Both of them have diagnosed OCD or OCD like traits that are mostly expressed as constant obsessive thinking. Each will state a problem, go into detail (extreme detail) then repeat that idea over and over and over and over and over multiple times within a conversation...and then again in the next conversation, and again....each day, every day. It increases my own anxiety SO MUCH! Even when I'm not anxious to begin with.
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  When it happens, I set boundaries: I will listen once without giving advice unless you ask for it. I will listen a second time and give advice, whether you ask or not. If you don't take my advice, I don't want to hear it again--I can't do a thing to help, and stating the problem another 5000 times is not going to resolve this; it doesn't help either of us.
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  My partner generally lets up a bit for a while, or doesn't bring it up as much after I say this--but goes back to the same thing within days. My sister gets angry. ""You just don't understand what all i'm going through!!!"" (I do, I simply can't add anything to the equation and I'm getting anxious hearing all of this YET AGAIN!!).
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  There have been times when she won't message me for a day or two because she says I am not doing enough (one of her anxieties is our dad--she lives an hour away from him and does take on more than I do, physically, as I'm across the Atlantic, 4000 miles away). I do as much as i can, but i refuse to worry about many of his issues simply because I don't consider them something to worry about. And honestly, he's now in a care home and they are NOT constant issues. She says I'm wrong not to worry. SIGH).
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  OK, this has become much longer than I planned, but I am frustrated here.
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  I get anxiety, I really do. I am not one to vocalize my worries to the extent they do, though, so I have no idea what wort of things actually help in this situation. 
  
 

  &amp;#x200B;
  
 

  For those of you who are like them, how do you feel supported and listened to when you're in their situation? (besides someone to listen to the exact same thing 100 times with no change--I have my limits and my boundaries are appropriate and necessary for me)."
"I've taken benzos for about 40 years. Xanax for the first 14 and then Klonopin for the last 26, .5 twice a day and haven never gone over 1 mg a day. I have been on every SSRI, SNRI, TCA, MAOI inhibitors and all of the atypical including Buspar. The side effects of these are terrible, even after you get past the first 8 weeks and they never made me feel good. What they did for me was take me from drowning to treading water, but never was I swimming. They made me tired, achy, numb, gave me headaches, the shakes, sleep problems, sex problems, bathroom problems and more. Switching antidepressants was always a challenge and the withdrawal of going off of them was wicked. I have also tried ECT, acupuncture, every supplement known to man and intravenous vitamin therapy and read tons of self help books. NOTHING HAS WORKED AS WELL AS THE KLONOPIN EVEN AFTER ALL OF THESE YEARS.
  
 

  I now only take my Klonopin .5 two time a day. It still works after all of these years. I don't have panic attacks anymore. I get anxious now and then, just like all people, but it is manageable. My hand is steady when I hold it out, unlike the shake it had with any antidepressant. I'm 63 now and plan on staying on this dose until I die and if I die at 80 instead of 85 because of benzo use, well so what. The years between 80 and 85 would probably be crappy anyway. There are mixed studies on dementia being linked to long term use. Some say yes, some say no. I'll take my chances. Nothing can be worse than being mentally unstable. 
  
 

  I've read all of the horror stories about withdrawal and I will tell you that they are true. I was foolish enough to listen to a few anti benzo doctors and try the slow taper. It was painful and even after tapering to nothing, my anxiety came back, irritable bowel flared up, fibromyalgia flared up, tinnitus flared up. When I reinstated the Klonopin, things slowly got back to normal. I see people say that after withdrawing, they are still messed up 3 years down the road. Did they ever consider that they got on the drugs for a reason and without the meds, they are back to the way they were before they got on them. Remember, most doctors are advising you on what they learned in school and the latest studies which may or may not be funded by some drug company with an agenda. The doctors don't know what it feels like to be on an SSRI or have anxiety so bad that you feel like killing yourself. Advocate for yourself. I've been to 6 psychiatrists in my life and I guarantee you that I know more about myself than they do. I know what works for me and what doesn't.
  
 

  In the best of worlds, I wouldn't have to take any medicine, but I do and Klonopin helps me. I'm not worried about falling down when I'm 75. I'm worried about being comfortable in my own skin and the benzos do that for me. I worked my whole life, raised a family and am successfully retired now. I would not have been able to do this or be a functioning, participating member of society if not for benzos.
  
 

  As Socrates said, ""Know thyself"" and don't let all of the anti benzo crowd scare you. Most of the long term benzo users aren't hanging around message boards. They are busy enjoying their life. This is my first post ever. I just thought maybe you would like to hear another perspective. The only tolerance that I experience was in the beginning, they give you a pleasant, high feeling. That will go away after a few weeks, regardless if you're taking 1 mg per day or 3 mgs per day. If you are looking for that long term high feeling, then benzos aren't for you, since you will have to keep increasing the dose. If you are looking for stability, then take a dose that will provide that stability to you. My stability threshold is .5 Klonopin 2x a day. Hope it works for you as well as it has worked for me. Peace."
"Just wondering what temp everyone sleeps at here and how that comes into play with anxiety?
  
 

  I myself run pretty hot and get very restless if the temp is anything over 23C (73.4F).
  
 

  Most optimal for me would be in the 16-18C range (61-64F). I just feel that way I can wrap myself in a cocoon of blankets and fall asleep way easier.
  
 

  I find it also helps with mitigating my anxiety since my body is more calm."
"I've had issues with anxiety most of my life (I'm 61 now) but have mostly been able to just deal with it - until the last couple of years. With so much bad news everywhere, plus dealing with some family issues, my appetite for almost two years now has been horrible. I was fully checked out by my GI doc last summer and they found nothing wrong. Blood work is all normal. I'm sure it's anxiety related, but nothing seems to help. It's affecting my marriage because we seldom have a meal together. I'm able to keep my weight fairly stable by chugging down Boost supplements, but it's not ideal.
  
 

  Can anyone help?"
"Hello everyone. New to this forum, but not new to anxiety. Just looking for a little clarity. I'm 61 and have been experiencing abdominal discomfort and an overall feeling of being unwell for the past couple of years. Have had multiple medical tests to see if there is anything wrong physically, but they all seem to think I'm in great shape. Wrong. My quality of life just sucks. A vague discomfort that travels around my body and shows up in different ways. I've been married to the same woman for twenty years but feel like I'm living with a stranger. She's not a bad person, but it seems like the dynamics just suck. It feels like I'm constantly off balance, stirred up, frustrated around her and that I've lost my identity. I know this is not a marital forum, but is it possible that the years of tension are manifesting physically in my body in some really severe ways? And how could I know for certain, meaning how could a person test such a hypothesis to find out? I'm living in this strange painful gray area, not dead, but unable to fully engage with life. Could unhappiness/anxiety add up to horrible vague physical symptoms? That seems like an absurd thing for me to ask, considering there have been several times in my life when I've visited an emergency room, fully convinced that I was dying, only to be informed that it was severe anxiety! But is it possible that anxiety could cause a constant low-grade pain in the body like I'm experiencing now? Anyone else have something chronic like this that they would undoubtedly attribute to anxiety? Again, I'm looking for clarity. I'm truly confused. Thanks in advance for any feedback."
"Hey everyone, hope I'm posting in the right place and flaring okay.
  
 

  I've always had some sort of anxiety and high response to fight or flight situations. I'm also a bit high strung and ready to go all the time. I try my best to chill, but I feel like this is just so natural to me and part of me.
  
 

  I'm in my 30's. Got a resting avg HR of 93. I think my HR has always been high despite pretty good at cardio and fitness (I heard that's supposed to lower it). But maybe my anxiety overrides that, not sure.  
  
 

  Just wondering, is it common to have a high resting HR among fellow anxiety peeps?
  
 

  I heard beta blockers might be a good option, but they have many side effects or no?
  
 

  I don't take any medications at the moment. I've felt happy with my life so far... just anxious.
  
 

  Thanks."
"I've always felt pretty hyper aware through my life. I feel like I can notice the smallest things, feel any little sensation in my body, and tune into noises more than the average person.
  
 

  I guess maybe it's my adrenaline running high, I'm not quite sure?
  
 

  But I can notice my heart beat a lot of the time, feel when it's getting faster or slower.
  
 

  I can be talking with someone in a room, but also be listening to people's conversations across the room.
  
 

  If I hear noises in the office at work or at home, I really tune into them and anticipate on what it might be. A lot of the time I'm right.
  
 

  Anyone else like this? Wondering if people on here have tips on how to mitigate being so high strung and anxious. Thanks."
