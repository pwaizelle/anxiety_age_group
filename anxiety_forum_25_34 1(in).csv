"im a 26 yo male blusher, i really suffered from blushing. everytime i did a presentation there are always someone pointing out my red face. but my dream is to pursue master &amp; doctoral degree. this blushing have ruined my life. i lost my jobs, income, friends, droput, you name it...
 

 any people who have this experienced but become a teacher or a job that need ""caught in the spot"" or ""public speaking"" ? because i cannot imagine being caught in a spot everyday while pursuing my degree. especially we must speak more in master &amp; doctoral. 
 

 and what is your experience with this? thanks a lot!!"
"I (26F) have been dating my boyfriend (26M) for seven months. We are going great; this is the best relationship I have ever been in. There's nothing he has said or done that makes me think he is going to break up with me. In fact, he actively makes statements that place him and I together in the future (""I can't wait for us to adopt a dog together..."" or ""When we move in together one day...""). He tells me he loves me every day, sometimes multiple times. He goes out of his way to help me, makes sure I get home safe, etc. He's literally everything I've ever wanted in a partner. 
 

 Despite all this, I sometimes can't help but get gripped by anxiety sometimes and spiral, convinced he is going to decide one day that he doesn't love me anymore or that he has been faking his feelings all along. I logically know this is silly and my fears are wholly unfounded, but I still get looping thoughts about this.
 

 I've been diagnosed with anxiety and OCD and have been on an SSRI med/dose I have been super happy with for 3+ years. This is the first time I have been in a relationship since going on this medication, and these anxieties about him breaking up with my only popped up in the last two months or so. 
 

 I've brought this particular anxiety up with my boyfriend (who is aware of my anxiety/OCD) a couple of times, and he was like, ""I promise I am not faking being in love with you! I have no plans whatsoever to break up with you, don't worry."" 
 

 I am wary of touching this topic with him again because I don't want to annoy him and also because I know that my asking him for reassurance is just a compulsion to alleviate my anxiety. How can I work through this and just enjoy this wonderful relationship I have?"
"I don't have many friends and have less than a handful of people I regularly text. I've been recently trying to meet new people by going to meetups. I've been successful in meeting quite a bit of people and exchanging numbers. But I'd say I never end up reaching back out to about 90% of the numbers I exchange. Likewise, most people I give my number to never reach back out to me.
 

 Now every one in a while, I do genuinely meet people I actually want to hang out and be friends with. So as a result, I've been trying to be the one to reach out first to start chatting and organize a meet up. No matter who it is, I always get severe anxiety whenever I start texting someone. It's worse when its a girl. Like I don't fall in love or want to date every girl that I meet, but I do genuinely want to be friends with them and I get extreme anxiety in initiating a text start chatting because I'm worried they think I'm trying to ask them out.
 

 I just texted this girl last night who I got to know during another meetup. I genuinely want to just meet up with as friends as she's a graphic designer and told her I could help her out with her work and show her how to get free Adobe programs since I've also done graphic design. She mentioned to me when we met that this was something she was interested in so that's why we exchanged numbers. Unfortunately she never responded to my texts so I'll just take this as she's not interested in meeting me or my text came out wrong and she might be thinking I'm trying to ask her out. This makes my anxiety even worse.
 

 Last week I went to a bar meetup to do trivia and ended up meeting a few new people in our team. We did very well and placed second and a few of my teammates said they go here every week for trivia and we exchanged numbers as I told them I would be interested in joining them again. It's trivia night again and I want to go but alas, I'm having anxiety in trying to text my teammates to ask if they are going tonight.
 

 I'm a boring person and suck at texting because I get anxiety on almost everything I try to text. I also suck at conversations because I don't know how to keep conversations going. I get so self conscious when I try to text someone because of how they will perceive me texting them. I don't think there any cure for this. I just suck at all communication. Can therapy even help out with this?"
"Hi everyone, I am having intense anxiety at the moment. My bladder feels like there is pressure, when I go to the bathroom I’m ok but I cannot stop fearing the worst. I read into bladder issues and uti and I think it’s going to spread to my kidneys or I have something else. I got a uti last summer and that’s it. I can’t go to the hospital again as I can’t risk getting in trouble with work and my doctor is dismissive and rude. I’ve also had periods of going to sleep and not remembering I fell asleep or if I was awake tonight and the anxiety is making me feel like im not grounded or something if that makes sense"
"i just came back from my psychologist. i told her that i have blushing issue with my face. i want to pursue my master degree and later doctoral degree. but this blushing issue keeps blocking my mind, especially when im at ""caught in a spot"" position or doing some presentations. i graduated from mechanical engineering in 2017 and work in a bank for 2 years as a sales (stupid me!!), and after that i resign because of the blushing issue keeps my performance very low, i built a business in 2020 and only last 1 year because of covid. in 2021 i got a scholarship to study MBA in another country but the language is so ahard for me to understand. so i gave up my scholarship. 
 

 right now i am confused what to do. i have been to 2 psychologist, the first one said that blushing is not a problem and it is not a big deal, but for me it ruined my life, i dont have any income now. the second psychologist told me this morning that the problem is not myblushing, it is my inconsistency to become a person. if i manage to work in industrial or engineering the problem of blushing will be less occured. she told me that she guarantee that i will success pursuing master degree and doctroal degree. but she remind me if i have graduated and become a lecturer, those blushing will occur again and what will i do.. my percentage to become a lecturer is also smaller than others because i dont have practical skill because i never invlolved in industrial work or mechanicla engineering work.
 

 i am really tired of my life because of this blushing, i cannot do anything besides sitting in front of my laptop every day. my second psychologist also feel strange that this is a first case of blushing issue of 25 years she became a psychologist, and she also said it is not a big deal. 
 

 what do u guys think? should i take master degree? or is there any other solutions that came up on your mind? my only motivation life in is to use my mind and body to donate and find new discovery in science, thats why i like study. but this blushing problem... :("
"I (25F) have been struggling with anxiety for a long time, but it hit its peak in 2020. At that time, it was hard for me to leave the house and I leaned on my husband (25M) a lot. And, me being increasingly uncomfortable with seemingly everything, it meant I was also uncomfortable with him doing a lot of things. I started going to therapy a couple months ago and have been healing and doing a lot better, but now my husband brings to my attention how hard my anxiety has been for him. He felt that it was ruling over his life, which is completely fair and valid. I have tried to explain to him why I acted the way I did and how uncomfortable I feel, but he doesn't understand. There are still things I'm not quite comfortable doing and it has caused so much tension and him disconnecting from the relationship. I feel he sees me as his enemy because of the anxiety. I want him to be able to understand and find support, but I can't make him do anything. 
 I thought there could be someone who has gone through a similar situation. The last thing I want is my anxiety to ruin my marriage."
"I have been recommended medication for my anxiety by multiple people. but I'm worked it will effect my art, music, and writing. I don't want to be emotionless or have a dulled mind from taking medication.
 

 Is there any kind of medication that wont do that? I can beardly work on my artistic skills at all right now, presumably from my anxiety and partly depression."
"I've basically had SA my whole life and although I've come a long way, I'm still struggling with people pleasing and being myself, since I've never done that. I'm 25m btw. I thought I was making good progress, until I realized I was still doing it, maybe more subtly than before.
 

 Examples: 
 

 I'm trying to be overly humorous, especially in dating and while I enjoy this newly found side of mine, it feels like a coping and hiding mechanism.
 

 I have a hard time talking about topics and stuff interesting to me. That's a usual SA problem I think, but since I'm a nerd, interested in new age spirituality, there's always the feeling that most people around me wouldn't be interested so I don't bother.
 

 I say things to please other people, although they might not be true or I might not be feeling it. Again, usual SA.
 

 I'm happy when other people approve of me and my actions. I'm sad when they react negatively or even start criticizing me. It's also a problem if they're neutral or ignore me.
 

 I'm always thinking how I could have acted differently to please sb in the past or all the ways I could act to please sb in the future.
 

 And many more.
 

 I know I have to put myself out there and be vulnerable, even if I get rejected. I know this can't happen overnight and I need to be patient. But it sucks.
 

 If you have any suggestions or something that's helped you on your journey to becoming comfortable with yourself and more confident, please share.
 

 tldr: I have a people pleasing problem and have trouble being myself. Any advice?"
"I embarrassed myself during a stupid icebreaker game in front of my entire organization. Imagine someone who is blatantly nervous and awkward, and has to present, and you just feel so bad for them and need to look away because of the cringe....that awkward person was me at the meeting.
 

 I hate myself at the moment. I can't face my coworkers. Will this feeling subside?
 

 I'm 25 and had to take a small break after the meeting to cry it out. Smh"
"I'm not someone who has an anxiety disorder or anything, but there are some things that really scare me, and this is probably number one on that list these days. 
 

 I'm M28 and I've had long hair for years (which I cut myself) because I'm too afraid to have anything done with my hair. The sporadic few times I've been to get it cut and styled I've always made sure to go to a different place each time, and I've never been happy with the result despite going for something different each time. 
 

 I don't understand how people are able to get their hair styled so nicely so effortlessly, and especially continue to style it the same way by themselves each day. It infuriates and embarrasses me at equal measure just thinking about it. 
 

 I just feel really ugly and self conscious when I get in front of the mirror and have to specify what I want, then act like I'm super happy with the result each time. Sometimes I think I just have really shitty hair to work with or something, but people have complimented me on it even when it's been a complete mess, and I have a fairly thick head of hair which I suppose is a good thing considering how many guys start losing that at my age. 
 

 I also hate knowing that everyone will be aware that I've had my haircut when I get it done, and I cringe at the thought of having to listen to loads of comments from people, so that gives me anxiety too. 
 

 I really want to change this and I feel like it's important for my confidence and self esteem moving forward to get over this fear."
"For the past 3 years, not having a driver’s license has always made me feel insecure, because most of my friends have their’s and I always had to rely on people to pick me up or drop me off. I’ve failed the test twice before 3 years ago, and finally passed today. It feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, and I just want to let people know that the anxiety (whether its for driving or for testing) gets better! For those of you who are nervous or anxious about the test, one advice that worked for me is - accepting that failure is a possibility and that it is ok as long as you try again. In the long run, it wont matter how many times you take the test, as long as you’re a safe driver!"
"I’ve (25F) always been an anxious person, especially regarding my health, but I’m starting to get to the point that I can’t function at a normal capacity and it’s ruining my life. I’ve vomited small amounts of blood after drinking for several years now, but my HA has prevented me from ever seeking medical advice because I’m so terrified of a diagnosis. Finally, after it happened again for the first time in a while, I went to the ER and was referred for an endoscopy. It’s been a month and I still don’t have an appointment and every day has gotten worse and worse for me mentally. I am fully convinced that I have stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, skin cancer, ovarian cancer, ever type of cancer under the sun. I know others struggling with this must know how I feel but I’m 100% sure I’m dying and nobody can tell me otherwise. 
 

 I’m just struggling so much because I don’t know how to regulate my concern. Obviously something is going on with my health, hence the vomiting blood, but I’m completely unable to exert a normal amount of concern. This is also new to me because I would 100% rather not see a doctor and not know that there’s something wrong than have to receive a diagnosis. 
 

 This obsession has gotten to the point that I’m struggling at my job, I’m unable to perform basic tasks like laundry or washing dishes. I lie on the couch all day every day and work myself into a panic. My stomach is full of anxiety and I feel like I’m on the brink of a panic attack every moment of every day. What can I do? I have an appointment to talk to a doctor re: my anxiety on Monday, but I need some words of encouragement or something. I don’t know how I can go on like this."

"So im gonna start with some short context possible to write on a reddit post. I'm 25 years old and I have never experienced hard anxiety before. I had the usual anxiety you get before an exam or an important event but anything different than that, I haven't experienced anything worse. I'm an only child and I have been over protected most of my life. Both parents are old and they had hardships so it is understandable. 
 

 Now for how my anxiety started. I was in danger of getting COVID mid January. Like really close. I was extremely lucky that I didn't get it. After that day, I started having anxiety everyday the whole day. When I had a small COVID sympton I would start shaking, feeling nauseous and having to check my fever/oxygen everytime. I did that like 20-25 times per day. Then, 3 days after I got my negative result but the anxiety didnt stop. I was still feeling nervous, nauseous. I could eat but it was really hard to. Waking up was really scary because everytime I woke up, I felt dizzy/naseous, my body was tense and I felt nervous. I have always had sleeping problems (I use to always wake up tired even after sleeping 8h+) but never like this. I'm a person that I feel like absorb the environment feelings so I had to cry some of the days to feel better. Hopefully, my parents were there to support me and understood me completely. I was really lucky in this aspect. After being like this for a couple more days, I realized that I was having anxiety and immediately contacted a psychologist. With the passing of the days, I started informing myself and tried to apply some breathing techniques to that helped me but I still had days of feeling nervous almost 14 hours of the 16 that I was awake. I had really dark thoughts, that I have never in my life had before and it scared me a lot. I started being scared of the fact that the anxiety wouldnt go away and it would get worse. I started sessions with my psychologist, which help me a lot. Like A LOT. It was an immediate help. The perspective of my problem changed and I started getting better. I was scared of going out or meeting people that don't really care about COVID anymore, but also, this COVID incident triggered other inner problems that I've had my whole life. I started trying to go out more, doing simple tasks such as buy groceries, help my parents with bank stuff, go to my family meetups and even meet up friends a couple times. 
 

 I've been 1 month with my psychologist now. I have various days of the week where I am completely anxiety free, or I have really small anxiety that only affects me a couple minutes and I can control with simple breathing techniques and calming myself. 
 

 What happens to me now is that sometimes I wake up feeling super nervous. After a couple days of being mostly anxiety-free, I wake up feeling tense, nervous, with negative thoughts, thinking that I'm about to have a panic attack (which I haven't had so far), but I feel on the edge. After a couple minutes or sometimes hours, I can relax myself. Maybe after watching some youtube videos, TV or standing up for a bit, the feeling goes through. I dont try to fight it, but sometimes it really is hard to not try to fight it, because it gets really scary. 
 

 Right now, im jobless, studying for the CFA Level 2 (Finance Certificate), which is gonna take me 6 months to study and preparing myself to move out of the country for a Masters in 7 months. I feel like I'm getting better but the relapses are discouraging. I know it is normal and I try to stay strong, but I wanted to share what is happening to me now and see if anyone can talk about similar experiences and what they did to overcome them. 
 

 I really appreciate people that read this and appreciate anyone that wanna share their experiences and advices!"
"So I just recently found out about this test you can do to see how your body reacts to different medications and was wondering if it was helpful? Basically you swab the inside of your mouth and send it to the company for testing and they'll tell you what reactions your DNA has to various medications. I've seen a few different companies that do it, GeneSight being the main one I noticed. Is it actually helpful or is it a waste of money?
 

 I do intend to see a psychiatrist soon and I'll definitely ask them about it too but I figured I'd ask here as well."
"Hi. This is my first post, bear with me lol. 
 

 I’ve been struggling with anxiety in my current relationship because there have been subtle changes in the way he (33m) communicates with me (28f). We’ve been dating 5 months but only official for 3 out of those 5 months. After our first few dates he would always say very sweet things and mentioned that I brought out this sweet side out of him and it went the other way around too, he brought out my sweet side too. Fast forward a bit and we’ve already met our families, said I love you to each other, traveled together and continue to see each other regularly. Recently, I noticed we’re moving away from the sweet talk but I only stopped because I noticed he wasn’t really saying things like that anymore (complimenting/expressing excitement etc). It scares me because my past relationship ended because we were comfortable and our feelings plateaued and dissolved quickly. I really don’t want to be in a “comfortable” relationship because that feels like a symbol that it won’t last and it makes me really anxious. I’m crazy about this guy and I think he is too (at least I hope) but I don’t want to be blindsided. Is there anyone else that struggles with this and if you do, is there anything that helps or makes you feel more secure? I also want to bring it up to him in a healthy way and I’m not really sure how without saying “hey the vibe is kinda off to me, are you gonna dump be”? and that sounds bonkers. Appreciate any input. xx"
"Idk what it is or how to even explain how I truly feel but the best way I can think of is I don’t feel human most the time anymore and I’m actually scared.I can go about my day doing normal day to day things and out of no where I get this pre panic attack feeling and just feel stuck. I don’t want to move or a speak till It goes away and it used to last for a few minutes then it turned to 30 min,1 hour,3 hours, 7hours and now I feel like this,through almost half the day.I get so stuck in my head that I forget what’s going on on the outside.my memory is slightly decreasing,I can’t pay attention to anyone trying to tell me something and I’m always zoned out.Most things I remember I used to love doing scares me now and idk why.My worst fear is losing my mind at any moment and I honestly feel like it’s going to happen.Sorry for the grammar."
"So long story short I have been going to concerts since I was little (25F) and growing up I never really had anxiety about hearing loss or super bad anxiety in general. Once I hit 22 my anxiety ramped up. It came and went but it’s back in FULL swing. Anyways, I went to a concert last night, it didn’t seem too loud though cause it was outside and we were way in the back, but I woke up this morning to ringing in my right ear and it feels so loud. Idk if I’ve always had it and just never notice it until now, but now I’m freaking out thinking I’m going deaf 😭 I literally forgot to bring ear plugs last night so it is my fault there. Does anyone else have this? I just want to be okay.. I’m too young to be going deaf 😭"

"Hi everyone, I’m a 27M and have just started taking Remeron/Mitrazapine for a week and I’ve become so heavy. I’ve put on 6 kgs in 1 week. I was already overweight. Now I literally want to chop my belly off.
 

 How do I lose this crazy instant weight gain? Will it wear off and I’ll lose weight after getting used to the medication? Cause it has been helping my anxiety a lot after 8 years of trial and error with so many meds."

I have anxious attachment style and I have autism as well. I'm 28 and I've never had a relationship last more than 2 months. at this point I feel no ones gonna understand or love me and I'll be alone forever.
"I went out to a meetup event yesterday and met with a group of people. I was able to put myself out there, talk, and be social. I went home and was happy I was a good day and had good social interactions. The next after waking up, immediately started thinking back to the night and started overthinking everything I did. I was thinking about the things I said and how others might have perceived the . I was cringing back at all of the topics I was talking about and kept saying to myself why was I talking about this? I can't stop thinking about how people might think of me as some kind of weirdo. I'm shaking right over thinking everything I did last night."

"I think the worst part about health anxiety is how you can’t help but worsen your symptoms by seeking validation. It’s why we Google ourselves into panic attacks, and it’s why I’m panicking right now! 
 

 I won’t go into too much detail, but there’s currently a buzzfeed article about a woman whose symptoms were ignored by multiple doctors with ~scary~ results. Now, I’ve struggled with similar symptoms to this woman for years, in addition to bad anxiety surrounding the symptoms. I haven’t been to a doctor for years because I got a chronic illness diagnosis, but what if I’m actually suffering from the same condition the woman in the article was suffering from? 
 

 Just when I was starting to feel a bit more stable with my health anxiety, this happens. Ugh. I’m trying to be rational about it, but now I’m spiraling and overthinking about literally every symptom. 
 

 It just sucks that we have to deal with this all the time! One moment of weakness leads to days of misery. 🙃"
"Apologies for the long post and formatting. Im on mobile. 
 

 To start, I am 28. 
 

 Prior to last week, I never felt like I needed it a license. (I still feel that way sometimes) after a tumultuous driving experience with my dad 9 years ago, I kept putting it off. When I began to take it seriously, I found out I developed full blown cataracts at 26. With covid and my insurance lapsing I was finally able to get the surgery and heal at 27.
 

 My dad bought my driving lessons through a school and it was great. Until my first time testing.
 

 I had a horrible tester, he was a retired cop who claimed I was an atrocious driver, and went so far as to lie and said he took the wheel from me during the test. He did not. He managed to utterly destroy my confidence by screaming at me in front of people. (Including the owner of the schools husband. Who was even more confused than I was.)
 

 As it turns out, cameras caught my driving and the owner contacted me personally and got my side of the story, along with my instructor. 
 

 I was told I should have passed the first time. She retested me last week and I aced the test with 0 points docked. ""Absolutely perfect."" 
 

 I haven't driven since. I don't have a car of my own and my parents outright refuse me use of their vehicles. Which I can understand. 
 

 I just dont feel the desire to drive. Everyone is talking about the freedom of it, but all I can think of is the expenses and it just feels like a chore if that makes sense? 
 

 If I'm with friends I dread they'll ask me to drive and my heart starts pounding.
 

 Can anyone relate? Does this fade? Any help/advice would be appreciated 😊"
"Hello, so a little of back story I (F26) have had health anxiety for over a year now, with periods of cardiophobia. Recently they found a respiratory arrhythmia and episodes of SVT, they ordered an eco and a 24h Holter but I won't know the results until the 24th which has increased my overall anxiety so much that I had what I think are panic attacks.
 

 I suddenly get this feeling in my stomach like very strong butterflies, you know like the rush you get when you are in a rollercoaster, then I have cold and hot sensations, and my heart starts pounding and feels really irregular, no problems with my breathing though, it lasts a few minutes but then it stops but I'm left feeling uneasy.
 

 This has happened three times before the diagnosis. The last one I had was the worse because I was so fixated with my heart there was a moment where I couldn't find my pulse and I legit thought my heart stopped and was gonna die, I got up fast trying to find my pulse and all of a sudden I felt all the blood drain from my head and started to see black in my vision, and I thought, this is it, this is the moment I die, and I truly believed it. I found my pulse again and regained a little bit of control but had to call my partner to pick me up because I thought if I got to sleep I would die.
 

 Since then, which was 4 days ago, I have been feeling very uneasy, like on edge, and I think It's going to happen again so I have this feeling in my stomach that it will repeat often when I'm at home alone. I lost appetite, I'm nauseous, I feel my arms weak...I just feel awful all the time. I have doctor on Thursday but I don't think I'll be able to keep it together until then.
 

 Sorry for the long post..."

"Hey guys (28M), I have been struggling with anxiety and panic attacks for about 3 weeks now caused by loneliness and lack of affection. I started living on my own just as the pandemic started and I suspect I am actually dealing with some form of PTSD as currently at least in our country the pandemic is technically over. I was previously in a long-term relationship, deeply in love.
 

 The core of my issue is that I desperately lack affection from someone. I do meet with friends few times a week I have a buddy to chat with but I don't really get the love and affection part form these kind of relationships. I feel pretty much lonely all the time. I only have one person available atm to give me this kind of love that nobody else can since I don't have a girlfriend obviously.
 

 So my mom offered me to stay with them for some time and it would definitely make me feel a bit better but I am scared that I would then have harder time getting back on my own. Should I give in to the need or should I try fighting it?"
"It is a really stressful week for me. Im currently working in a small game studio. Recently i got a new job offer. The salary they offered was higher and working conditions seemed better. They were really excited to work with me. I gave them a positive feedback but i said i have to talk with my bosses. (I tried to look really positive and tried to not fail anyone.) They wanted me to talk with the bosses as soon as possible so i didn't have a proper time to think clearly. 
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

  when i told the bosses i want to quit i thought they would be cool with it but they acted emotional ( i've been working here for 3 years) They said they'll make any the conditions the same as the other company told so. Also they offered higher salary. What is worse is the other company who offered me the new job sent me a chocolate box for women's day. (Im a nonbinary but i thought telling that after they sent me the chocolates would be rude) I was really confused and felt like stuck in between. Felt so guilty. So i asked some people that more experienced and they recommended me to stay at my current job. So i made my decision. 
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 An hour ago i called the company told him that i am really sorry, i don't want to let down anyone but i want to stay my current job. There was a silence. He told me it's my decision but he sound so disappointed. He told me that i was accepted their offer so they already bought my equipments and they made the calls. I had no words. Only said that i am sorry. He said it's okay but it didn't sound like that. Then we hang up. 
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Now i feel really guilty. I never thought trying to change or quit the job would be that hard and stressful. I am really tired. Please tell me it's ok. I really need that."

"Hello everyone! Title explains it all really.
 

 I'm 25 now, have had panic attacks since I was 16, and GAD since I was maybe 21. My senior year of college is where everything peaked for me, I was having multiple panic attacks every month, developed agoraphobia and was in general just terrified of life. Obviously that was no fun, so I did everything I could to push through it. I started seeing a therapist at the time and she helped me a bit, gave me some breathing tips and stuff. Also saw a psychiatrist that diagnosed me with panic disorder and g.a.d., and prescribed me I think it was called Lexipro? Something like that. Some sort of anxiety med.
 

 All my life I've been fairly anti-meds. Obviously medicine is important and helpful in tons of situations, but I've always just felt like ""if I don't need it, I'll try to avoid it"". If I had a headache, I'd avoid taking a Tylenol for example unless it was terrible.
 

 Reason being is because A. Obviously not healthy to take too many meds, especially ones with bad side effects B. I've always seen it as a ""band aid"".
 

 What I mean by that is, meds seemed to me like a temporary solution, just masking the deeper problem. So I never took those anxiety meds, I did therapy, and tried to push through on my own.
 

 For years it worked. First year or so it was rough but eventually I started living a healthier lifestyle (taking vitamins, balanced diet, working out, spending time with friends and family, etc) and journaling ""wins"" as I liked to call them (if I went somewhere I was worried might trigger my anxiety for example and managed to get through it fine, I'd document it).
 

 Up until last year it got better and better to the point where I can honestly say before the past year, I even forgot I had these issues. I'd go days, weeks, even months, feeling normal. Feeling like I did before all of this, when I was a kid.
 

 Then idk wtf happened. Past year, really just past 6 months probably, it's spiking up again. Little situations here and there but seemingly more frequently now. As of very lately, it's been controlling my life again and I hate it. Just went to the movies with my friends and had to leave during the trailers at the beginning to drive home bc of it. Example 1 of 400 lately.
 

 So I've decided to reach out to some therapists again hoping that maybe if I can talk to someone, they can help set me on the right path again like before.
 

 But this time around, idk.. I'm starting to think maybe I *should* consider meds. It's like, I hate it because it feels like I'm giving up. Like ""okay I can't beat my anxiety, looks like I need a drug to solve this"". But honestly at this point, my anxiety is interfering with my life too much (making me miss family weddings and stuff) to where I don't know what else to do.
 

 Really just wanted to make this post hoping I could hear some success stories maybe of people that took anxiety medicine? Idk. Just looking for some hope:/
 

 Are there any ""natural"" medicines? Cbd related stuff maybe?
 

 Also, there's medicines for the general anxiety, but I'm also wondering if I should consider more heavy duty meds to have on-hand in case of emergencies (full blown panic attacks) like Xanax. But then, I'm worried I'll become dependent on them and so on.
 

 Just looking for some thoughts ❤"
"On Sunday I had a very stressful situation - I realized my job contract ends in April, not in January as I was told. I got a panic attack, my family got worried and i could see them stressed as well. 
 

 On Monday I was told not to worry as my contract will get prolonged - but the anxiety, low key, but stayed. It comes in waves, is persistent at work, I can't focus, I can't talk myself out of it.
 

 I don't drink alcohol, I don't drink coffee nor black tea, I decided to stop eating sweets. But even my separation anxiety reappeared - what sucks big time as my dad is going to a rehabilitation center soon, for three weeks and I'll be home alone. 
 

 I have therapy on Monday, which I was intent on ending because I was doing so good, and I have a psychiatrist appointment in April, but what can I do until then? I can't loosen the tightness in my diaphragm with breathing exercises (or maybe I'm doing them wrong?), I can't talk myself through it. I'm so worried I lost my progress. 
 

 What can I do?"
"When I started out thinking I will do one task followed by a series of other tasks and absolutely ended up doing nothing, emotionally binge eating and feeling shitty about myself even more. I want to make a change and not take a step backwards. I want to make change happen. How do I do without feeling this overwhelmed?"
"Need some outside perspective on this. I don't know if she's asking too much from me or if I'm being sensitive about this.
 

 My girlfriend has a very quiet and closed off personality. She also suffers from anxiety and has insecurities. She doesn’t express her emotions either facially or verbally (vast majority of the time she displays a very neutral frown type facial expression despite being in a happy or sad state which makes her mood very hard to read). She doesn’t like to share her opinions on conversations. She’s generally very quiet and keeps to herself and almost goes out of her way to not draw attention to herself. I have a hard time holding a conversation with her as our common hobbies/interests are limited. What this means is when I give her these reassurance texts and compliments, I don’t feel like it’s making any impact (due of her lack of expressions, I can’t get a good read). This discourages me from giving her more reassurances. As I decrease the frequency of reassurances, she would subsequently tell me that she feels unloved. She would then explicitly tell me that she needs to hear MORE reassurances from me to quell her anxiety. This becomes a negative feed back loop and as time went on it felt harder and harder giving her what she wanted because:
 

 1. I’m not very good/comfortable giving verbal reassurances. I’m an “action speak louder than words” kind of guy and I try to show her that I love her by taking her out on dates and going for walks and road trips and such. Each time when I try to show her my love through action she would always have the same neutral facial expression that doesn’t indicate to me she’s having a good time. When I ask her how she’s doing she would always say she’s fine and having fun… but her non-verbal body language is always in neutral and she never really SHOW that she’s having a good time. Keep in mind our conversations are also mild and don’t get very deep due to her personality and lack of common interests.
 

 2. When I do go out of my comfort zone and verbally give her reassurances, I always end up getting discouraged due to her lack of emotional reactions.
 

 I am at a point where I am running low on energy to keep giving her reassurances but then I get called out for not doing enough to quell her anxiety and prove my love to her. Her constant lack of positive reactions from my gestures has gotten to the point where I'm starting to not enjoy going out on dates or nature walks with her anymore. As the frequency of dates decreased, she would then call me out and say something like “when was the last time you took me out on a date?” and would express to me that she felt unloved. I’m not sure how to resolve this. Are we doomed? Please advise.
 

 TL;DR
 

 girlfriend is making her anxiety my problem and asks me to change my behavior. Is she asking too much or am I just being too sensitive. There are tools for anxiety and it's up to her to learn how to control them, and not have to ask me to change my behaviors? Please advise."
"I’ve been dealing with anxiety since I was about 17, meds since i was 20. I’m now 26F and it has come and gone in waves my whole life. I have been off and on edibles since September 2020. It usually calms me down and levels me out. Occasionally I would get anxious but nothing I couldn’t sleep off. This past Friday I took an edible with a higher dosage than normal. I was feeling more anxious than normal the few weeks prior, so maybe I should have seen it coming. I totally freaked out and it felt like I fainted and my eyes rolled back in my head. I think I was unconscious for a second or two. That clearly made my body go into overdrive. Heart racing, adrenaline, short breathing. My roommate came to the rescue to calm me down. I have been feeling off since and super foggy/groggy with headaches and random twinges in my body. I have barely ate because everything sounds awful and i’m starving but eating makes my anxiety worse. Last night i went to bed at midnight with a raging headache and woke up around 3:15am because it felt like i fainted in my sleep and my body shot into overdrive. I was up most of the night and finally fell asleep around 6, at 7 i woke up again immediately with a heart rate of 126 and feeling of adrenaline. I Was so scared something bigger was wrong and I freaked out since it’s been a few days since the edible. I called my pcp and got an appointment,i got an ekg test and a full body physical. Doc said everything was normal, i just have high anxiety and its most likely the edible working it’s way through my body. I asked for blood samples and waiting on a response. 
 

 I cant help but think the doctor missed something even though everything (pending the blood test) came back normal. It seems too odd (not my normal anxiety feelings) not to be a bigger issue. I also have always had some health anxiety but this one takes the cake. I always push myself til my battery is empty and end up with a big breakdown(like today). I wouldnt wish the feelings on anyone and i think my family feels like i am over reacting and it must just be anxiety. 
 

 I don’t know what is real or what is anxiety. I’m exhausted. I’m tired. I feel stupid for going to the doctor about it - she probably thinks i’m an idiot. 
 

 Not sure the point- i just wanted this somewhere. Maybe someone to tell me they feel similar. Or that everything is going to be okay. Ive been crying off and on in private all day. This sucks!!!"

"I started with this chain of overthinking and I am feeling sick to my stomach right now. I need help, I usually write a lot but today I just need help to calm my thoughts"
"I posted a couple months ago, asking whether to tell a girl that I have SA on the first date. Majority of responses told me to just tell her I'm anxious with dates. That's what I did.
 

 Due to circumstances, it's our third date tomorrow and I feel I have to talk about my mental issues. I've played it cool the first two times and used fake confidence, but I've not overdone it, it felt like me but without SA. This time I want to go my real self and be honest.
 

 I'm at a hard point in my life and I'm trying to accept and love myself. This feels like the right thing to do. But I've never shared this outside of my family and one very good friend. I'm not good at sharing my emotions. I'm not good at explaining SA when I'm anxious. But always a first time I guess.
 

 I know to not dump everything on her and just go with the basics, but I can go real bad. Wish me luck and if you have any advice, tell me pls."

"I’ve suffered from GAD and panic attacks ever since I was about 11 (triggered by the death of my grandmother) I basically get the whole listen of symptoms both physical and mental.. I’ve had periods of time where it’s not so bad and periods where it’s crippling. I’m a mom now to an amazing 18 month old little boy. He’s the greatest things that’s ever happened to me. Unfortunately my health anxiety has gotten worse since having him because my biggest fear now is something happening to me and not being there for him because he’s such a mommas boy which I love. Also, anything happening to him is also a huge fear and I try to not be too overprotective..I know a few people I went to school with who have tragically passed away (cancer, car wreck,etc) who had young children and it breaks my heart… my anxiety lately has been bad again and I’m trying to figure out how to handle it.. I’m scared of prescriptions and used to use thc (medically legal) which always helped but makes me worse now that I’m a mom. My son still doesn’t sleep good either so I’m always super tired which I don’t think helps. Any advice or similar experiences are much appreciated. Thanks for reading!"
"I have my hypothesis, but here’s the thing, every single time I go out on a date with him I get anxious/excited, he is my first relationship and just yesterday… he texted ‘love you’ to me for the first time. He’s really shy so him saying it at all even in text makes me believe he really means it… could this be why? I mean I was honest when I told him ‘love you too’ cause I do…. He’s also the sweetest guy I know… gah any tips to lower this anxiety? I may not be able to read it till later but I’d appreciate it"
"Hi, I have a lot of issues coping with stress and anxiety, and have even only recently come to terms with my emotions. I am aware of my anxiety, and one of the biggest ways it affects me is when my partner and I fight. 
 

 If I do something that frustrates or annoys her, and she brings it up I find it very difficult to not spiral and make I end up making poor decisions. I feel like I'm letting my emotions get the better of me. If I don't fix it, it will be the end of my relationship. 
 

 How do I change my way of thinking, and defend against spiraling? What works for you?  
 

 Thanks everyone."
I (26f) have been having worse anxiety than normal the past few weeks and I have new symptoms of a tingling face and it feels like suddenly adrenaline is rushing through the front of my chest. I went to my pcp last week who said everything (blood work/physical/ekg) were fine. I just want to know this isn’t just me. I have big health anxiety about blood clots/stroke/heart attack. Need some reassurance this is probably just anxiety.
"Me 28f have been a stay at home mom since the day my baby girl was born. She is 3 now. Before having her I was a complete extrovert, but now I can’t even go to a public park without feeling so anxious. I tried going back to work but I would get full blown panic attacks. My hands would shake and I would just freeze unable to speak. I eventually quit and am searching for something with low stress. 
 I don’t know what happened to me. I used to be a completely different person. Has this happened to anyone else. 
 To make matters worse my anxiety triggers my GERD. So it’s a constant loop and I feel so helpless."

"I (F27) am in my first real romantic relationship with my boyfriend (28M). I know when we first started i was so worried all the time that I'd do something he wouldn't like and leave me, even though throughout the entire time we've been dating he's been really obvious that he likes me as much as I like him. Well as of yesterday I feel like things have changed for the better, the day before he texted to me that he loves me, now he's really shy so i was 85% certain he really meant it, but that anxiety made me wonder if it was real. Yesterday we went on a casual date and hung out at my place... we watched a movie (one that I quickly realized may not have been the best choice (turning red), yet he happily watched even though i tried to be sure multiple times he was ok with it... but he just smiled and said, ""I'm fine, I just enjoy spending time with you""). At the end of the movie i turned off the tv looked at him and we started kissing, slowly it soon became our first makeout/ french kissing session... and I was so happy. the session ends and as I'm relaxing in his arms i asked him if he really meant he loved me in the text... he said yes, and of course since i love him too I told him how I meant it too. 
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Now how did this event help beat my anxiety? well not only now do I have written, but also verbal and physical confirmation that someone is in love with me. something that for a long time I thought never would happen. with all these in mind i can now remind myself that my bf likes me for me and is happy just being with me, so I dont have to worry all the time about how I act or say around him. sure its fine to be embarrassed or anything like that, but not stress around him... just live in the moment and be happy.

 take that anxiety!"
"So I've been at my current job for a little over two years now. I'm not sure what my actual job title is anymore, but basically you could call me a front desk receptionist for an outpatient substance abuse clinic. Its a small clinic &lt;100 clients. I used to like my job, but within the past two months I have felt my anxiety skyrocket. To the point of where I have had insomnia, lost 10 pounds from lack of appetite, racing heartbeat, gagging every morning as I go out to my car and constant worry. I have been prescribed meds and tried to get into therapy. I've looked into self help resources to. Meditation, books, youtube videos ect.
 

 Analyzing my current job
 

 Management: Good
 Coworkers: Great
 Clients: Fine
 Work Life balance: Good, I am not asked to do anything for work outside of my usual hours except for the occasional question from a coworker
 

 The job duties have increased a lot since I started but they haven't changed much in the past five months since I got full time (i started at part time). 
 

 I think what's really gotten to me is that I was recently given a refresher on confidentiality and I think its really f'ed with me. Its a big deal and f'ing it up can be a huge problem. I don't want to slip up and its very easy to do.
 

 And I keep considering quitting. I live at home, no kids just a cat, my s/o is long distance and I have money in the bank so I can afford to quit. But I worry this is a slippery slope and that if my next job gives me anxiety the process will repeat.
 

 Thoughts?"
"Hi everyone in need of help to confirm what I am facing is anxiety.. ?? I am 26 year old male and 15 days ago I had severe heart platpitation along with pain in middle of chest , I ran to emergency room and they tested my ECG, blood test to and said it's anxiety. 
 

 later from a 2 week I am having chest pain that comes and goes in both side of chest sometimes it radiates to my back and fingers it's not stopping, also when I wake up from sleep I face shivering in my body which is not seen outside but I can feel I am termbling inside..
 

  Till now I have done ECG, blood tests, 2D echo, TMT test and doctor says everything is normal and I just have anxiety!! But my chest just don't go away.. I am struggling to deal with this.. Any help would mean a lot to me thanks 🌹❤"

"So I got a jury summons a little while back. I put off requesting an excusal and now I literally can't. It's too late because for some godforsaken reason I waited. I can't tell you why I did. I can barely leave my house without my anxiety kicking itself up to 11. I don't know why I somehow deluded myself into even considering it was an option I should keep open. Maybe some part of me felt guilty, like a kid staying home from school when they aren't *really* that sick. But I am sick. I can't even do things I enjoy, like going out to get shaved ice or celebrating holidays with family without my anxiety ruining it. The one time I could actually benefit from my anxiety, actually have it work in my favor, and I choose NOW to think ""maybe it's not that bad, maybe I should just wait it out"". WHAT? As if it wasn't in the back of my mind not to worry about it cause I'll just request an excusal. I was definitely planning on it so why did I wait? Why didn't I pay more attention to the due date of the excusal submissions?
 

 I better hope that at 5:00pm the day before they change my status to unneeded because if I have to be there at 7:30 am to answer questions I'm gonna be even more livid at myself. But hey, maybe I'll be so angry, I won't be anxious."

"I’m hard on myself to begin with, but it’s gotten worse over the past 3-4 years. It’s terrifying, for a few key reasons:
 

 I lost someone in a terrible, sudden car accident. They never saw it coming, and every time I get into my car I wonder if this is the day. Grief and aging don’t really mix too well together. I’m contemplating my own mortality more than ever now, and while it isn’t as bad as it used to be, it’s always on my mind. 
 

 Expectations. I just got married, so I feel like people are gonna start asking about kids, and I really don’t want kids. Neither does my husband. We both have legitimate reasons (grief, financial stability, emotional capacity, etc). We’re both anxious people and having anxiety can be a full time job in and of itself. I don’t know how to say I’m not in a financial or mental place to have children without sounding selfish or like an asshole. 
 

 I don’t really drink, because in my experience drinking has helped shut my anxiety up. Like this past weekend, I went out for dinner and drinks and felt like the alcohol really took the edge off of socializing and being in crowded places. I don’t want to start leaning on alcohol to cope with my anxiety disorder. But I feel like I’m expected to drink at every social gathering in order to be seen as an adult. Otherwise, people think I’m weird or snobby or prudish. 
 

 I’ve always wanted to be a writer, and I thought I’d be publishing or published by now. But things are moving a tad slower than I expected. For one, I didn’t really discover my writing process and voice until later in my twenties. Second, I work a full time day job that can get demanding. 
 

 Proactivity and socializing. My anxiety disorder makes it difficult to force myself to make and follow through with appointments (especially if I know something unpleasant is coming, like a blood draw or a Pap smear). Driving in unfamiliar places can cause a panic attack if I get lost. My college and high school friends are scattered around the country and overseas. Keeping in touch is difficult, plus my social anxiety puts my social battery in constant low power mode.
 

 I still have some separation anxiety. At 28. It’s so frustrating, because I always thought it was something I’d grow out of. My anxiety has thrown new challenges my way since I struck out on my own, and I just feel frozen sometimes. Any little thing can trigger it, like a rude person on the phone at work, or a crowded gym. I feel like it’s gotten more volatile with age, and I’m so worn down that all I want to do on weekends is sleep. 
 

 TL;DR: I’m pushing 30 and still don’t really have my shit together re: my anxiety disorder."
"(27F)
 I have OCD, PTSD, and GAD. Tomorrow is going to be a very triggering day for me and I need some ideas to combat it! 
 A little background; I have a therapist and a psychiatrist, I’m on medications and my anxiety usually presents itself as a gut wrenching feeling leaving me feeling like I’m unable to fully function. I feel paralyzed when I’m anxious and “getting moving” doesn’t really help much. I have 5 kids and am a stay at home mom. 
 Thanks in advance!"
"I (26f) have been diagnosed with general anxiety and have been fighting this for years. Since the new year I've found myself socially fatigued and pulling away from all my so called ""friends"" who I was never that close to, to begin with. 
 

 Deleted all social media (except reddit) and basically only have a couple of close friends now, outside of my workplace, where I have a few acquaintes. I figured I would experiment with removing social media from my life and REALLY trying by getting out and meeting new people in person. 
 

 Cut to last night- I attend the first of a few week's worth of weekly acting lessons. I'm stifled. Room full of strangers. Talk to one guy at the start and he's nice enough.
 

 Random people behind me are sniggering as people perform in a room of strangers one by one for each activity. This sets off my distrust mode. Instructor goes to call my name, then changes his mind halfway through my name then calls someone else, then makes me go last for this certain activity-doesn't do this to anyone else.
 

 Whole 2 hours I'm trembling inside and nauseous, trying not to have visible tremors. Cold sweats, sore neck, tightness everywhere, sharp stomach pains you name it.
 

 Got home after holding in tears in the taxi. Realised that the way I had to act in acting class brought back how I had to monitor my behaviour growing up around my now estranged parents and family. Cried and curled up in a ball when I got home (I completely regressed mentally, all my resilience is gone). Couldn't sleep properly last night. Called in sick today (but my boss at least knows I'm currently experiencing a mental health low).
 

 I fucking hate it. I'm not going back.
 

 TLDR: Attended first ever acting class. Hated the way my anxiety blew up for the whole 2 hours. Reminded me of how much I hate being around strangers and groups. Panic attack occurred when I got home. I'm a mess today."
"I’m (25F) a PhD student in microbiology, and I’m in my third year. (It’s worth noting at the top of this post that I am neurodivergent, I have anxiety among a litany of other diagnoses, but I’m pretty social.) My lab has weekly lab meetings to present our data and get feedback from the co-PIs and our peers. We’re a really close knit group, and everyone is friends with one another. 
 

 So, during lab meeting, I presented some new data as I do every week… We all have a similar sense of humor especially when things go wrong in our experiments &amp;amp; results (which is often). So, I do my presentation, give an update on some things that went wrong and don’t make sense, so on and so forth. My co-PI asks to speak with me after lab meeting. (Mind you, this guy is king of cracking jokes during lab meeting.) He pulls me to his office and tells me I have a nervous laugh and it makes my presenting seem less serious. I know that about myself, I’m a generally pretty happy person. I do laugh at myself and smile a lot, especially around people I like (like my lab group). I didn’t take offense to his pointing out I have a nervous laugh - I’m aware of it, I’ll avoid it during serious presentations … However, he went on to tell me that my nervous laugh is *irritating* and the last thing I want to do is irritate my committee in my upcoming evaluation. 
 

 Is it really that irritating when people have a nervous laugh or just generally laugh, joke, and smile a lot? I didn’t know I was irritating people."
"As long as I can remember, I've had anxiety about getting blood drawn and shots. I don't do well with needles. Recently, my doctor has discussed the idea of me having a hormonal imbalance and wanting to perform blood work. The very thought of getting my blood drawn sends me into full on panic attacks. I even fainted once because of it. Any ideas or advice on how to deal with getting blood drawn? I don't want to have panic attacks, cry, or even worse, faint. Thanks!"
"Anxiety sufferer here who's dealt with the ALS fear countless of times. It always starts with the twitching and the some muscle cramps which sends me down this terrible rabbit hole.
 

 

 I just can't shake it, like I know how irrational it is without serious other symptoms but I just can't get it out of my mind. Anybody overcome this one?"
"Part of why I wanted to take a solo trip, stay at a hostel, etc, was because I wanted to try to challenge myself and talk to/meet people.
 

 It’s not working. Most other people here are in groups of 2-3, and I have the impression they’d rather not take on a loner or are doing their own thing and don’t want to be bothered by me. I’m just about the only one out I see alone; almost everyone else is in groups or couples. 
 

 Im exploring, enjoying myself, and doing the activities I want to be doing - which is awesome, but a lot of ppl say how easy it is to meet people in other countries when you’re by yourself but at least for me it’s just not the case. 
 

 I know there’s more I could be doing to be “putting myself out there”, having fun and experiences, it just might be too hard for me."
"Sometimes my mind doesn’t feel anxious but I still have physical anxiety symptoms (tingly cheeks, neck pain, headaches) even when I don’t think I have anything to worry about. Is this just me?"
"I had a work meeting today in Teams with a big group of people and it was so awkward that I’m trying to recover nearly 9 hours later. In a nutshell my boss is kind of odd and asks my team to send out OTHER people’s meeting invites (for example, let’s say Lisa is kicking off a campaign and I’m involved in that project but I’m not the project manager - boss asks me to send out Lisa’s meeting invite to everyone). This creates confusion because people who show up to the meeting think I’m going to lead it since I sent the invite, but really Lisa is supposed to. Well that exact scenario happened today and Lisa didn’t really talk at all and she was supposed to lead the whole thing and it was MISERABLY awkward. The amount of silence and people awkwardly interrupting each other was unbearable and I basically died a slow death inside.
 

 It’s rough because these people don’t know me F2F since I’ve only worked there virtually, so they don’t know that I’m much more personable in person, but now I have all this crazy anxiety that they think I’m a brainless idiot :(
 

 Also, higher ups give me anxiety. Just the way they stare and scrutinize everything. It’s awful. And it’s probably not awful and all just my skewed perspective."
#help . Hi guys . I'm here to share my story . I'm 26 y Male from Algeria . I feel so depressed and lonely . No body to chat with . My life its deep pain . Idk why I cant find a gf or be happy . I'm without a job to . I always feel bad and depressed . Im always worried about my future . I'm always thinking how to find happiness . I wish someone understood me .
"It's killing me that I can't just decide to do something. I gotta know every single possible aspect of every option. I play out different scenarios in my head to see which would put me in the best end result but in all actually each option has good and bad aspects to it and most of it is just a matter of chance. It gets to a point where I'm so tired of thinking about it that it's easier to just not make a decision at all. I put things off or give up on things. 
 

 I've been doing the same thing about booking a psychiatrist appt. I can't decide where I want to go or if I want to do a televisit. Each place has both great and awful reviews. I've been sitting on this decision for weeks now, why's it gotta be such a hassle? OTL"
"I don't know if this fits here. If it doesn't, feel free to delete it mods! But I guess I just need to get this off my chest.
 

 I (26f) have suffered from anxiety my entire life. I have heard stories from I was like 3 that clearly showed signs of me having anxiety. I think it's hereditary. My mother clearly has anxiety as well but she's never been diagnosed and probably never will (we're Indian and the older generation frown on mental health). 
 

 Anyway, am currently on medication and it seems to make a difference. But after more than 2 decades of being a continuously nervous and awkward wreck, this is probably something that even my current therapist believes will never go away.
 

 I'll admit, I've been able to accomplish things despite being overly anxious (and being raised by an overly anxious woman). I graduated high school. I have my Bachelor's degree. I'm currently getting my post grad degree at a pretty great school. I'm even living on my own despite my mother originally trying to discourage me (culturally speaking, women aren't supposed to live on their own without husbands, so that had her freaked, despite the fact I'm her third daughter). I even have some pretty great friends. But the one thing I haven't mastered is driving.
 

 Driving has me in a full brain fog. I'm on edge. The driving tests have had me in full panic mode. I don't know how I managed to get my G2 (in Canada here). Every failed attempt had me have a breakdown in my bathroom. But now, my G2 is about to expire, I haven't driven in forever due to the pandemic and I don't think I'm mentally ready to go back. My siblings and my friends who are sympathetic to my issues are telling me it's ok I just got a regular ID card and try again from the beginning when I'm ready. Hell, my mother, my cousin and a close friend of mine don't drive. I've been able to take public transit anywhere and it's not like I can afford a car any time soon.
 

 But I don't know, I just feel like such a failure, even though I know I shouldn't. I've been in tears just typing this. It's hit me even more recently since my teenage sister is working on getting her G1 and I just feel like an adult failure despite everything I've accomplished. And I feel bad, because I would never consider any other adult who doesn't drive a failure, so why do I think that about myself? I just want the feelings and the comments from others (my father, other relatives, well meaning people, etc) to stop. I just wish I was ok with me not driving. I just want these feelings of inadequacy to stop (am talking to a therapist but still).
 

 Anyway, thanks for listening lol"
Man idk where to start and I don’t want to make this one of those long posts so I’ll just cut to the point. Been suffering from panic attacks and severe anxiety since a teen.How I got it I have no idea but it’s here I feel it and it has never went away.I currently suffer from insomnia and reason being is because my anxiety.I get anxious about sleep and sometimes I’m even scared to sleep.I’m scared of losing my mind.I’m scared of being schizophrenic.I’m just scared.I’m 27M and I wasted my early 20s on this vicious cycle and from the looks of it Im going into my 30s maybe even worse.For example my girlfriend is sleeping next to me and the only way I can try to sleep is by her waking up later on and making sure she watches me sleep so nothing can happen to me as I’m sleeping. See how pathetic that is? Every movement I make I always try to analyze it and stop and think about it.I’m always aware or alert on everything going on.Every word I say or every breath I take every movement I make and every thought I think of always has me on alert.Anyways back to the sleeping part.I feel like once I can over come this fear of sleeping I’ll be good again.Maybe lack of sleep fuels my anxiety and my anxiety fuels my lack of sleep.Vicious cycle I guess. If you read this thank you I appreciate your time.sorry for the bad English.
"I notice it mostly when I'm trying to fall asleep but sometimes once or twice during the day too. I think it's kind of like a startle response, similar to when you gasp when someone scares you. I don't think it's sleep apnea cause I don't feel like my airways are blocked when it happens. Sometimes it's also a quick exhale instead of an inhale. I only noticed it recently but my anxiety has been really bad the past couple of days so I'm assuming it might have something to do with that. I've also been having trouble sleeping. I feel like a spend a lot of time dreaming, I wake up often, and feel groggy in the morning."

Anyone else have to the point you can't watch movies or read because mentions of death distress you?
"What’s holding you back the most?
 

 [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/thv69h)"
"The reason why we’re so anxious is because we over analyze every social situation and interaction. What happens to us is a byproduct of our lack of social practice. Let’s use cooking as an example. Nobody just knows how to cook. If you have no idea how to dice, sauté, marinate, brine, or have no idea what those words mean, are you going to be confident in making a well prepared dish? Most likely not. Many people settle for making basic dishes, making salads and baking chicken in the oven because the culinary word seems too vast to even approach.
 

 That’s the mindset we have when it comes to socializing. The thing is, the solution is not theoretical, it’s practical. You don’t become a chef by reading cook books and it’s the same with socializing and building connections. We have to practice. Relentless action. Keep trying and trying. I understand, believe me I do, it’s scary to put yourself out there. I, for the first time in I don’t know how many years, invited a girl out and for the days leading up to that night (and even leading up to when she arrived), I had several nervous breakdowns and hoped she would cancel because I felt mentally and emotionally broken. 
 

 We have to practice. What do you do to practice? Are you here just to get tips, or are you here to learn what to do to get better? To get better, we need to expand our social repertoire. How might one do so? 
 

 Firstly, how many movies do you watch? Expand your media consumption. There are some quotes you can use for banter and chances are, someone else will understand and you can build a connection that way. Impersonations are charming, if you can do something as basic as that, even if you’re terrible, it’s funny. Consume more media so that you build some reference points, something to fall back on if you have nothing to say. Think about it, the funniest guy is constantly quoting entertainment, it’s a friendly way of uplifting someone.
 

 Expand your vocabulary. Read some books. Read fiction books to build upon your understanding of the English language (or whatever other languages you speak), this will allow you to become witty. Your fear of talking is routed not only in the fear of ending a conversation awkwardly, but also in your inability to articulate. By expanding your knowledge on phrases and words, you will have much more to say in a given conversation, this will create a more dynamic conversation that will entice the other individual. Yesterday, I had an eye opening moment. Sitting in the lunchroom with my coworkers and we were talking about customers. It was something that we all could relate with and I had tons of things to talk about yet when I spoke, it was spaghetti. I realized that words wouldn’t come to mind because I lacked them, which brings me to the last point.
 

 Practice articulating. Talking is a skill that needs to be practiced. Constantly. You don’t just gain an understanding, you have to sharpen it everyday. Because we’re so socially anxious, we don’t get to talk to people a lot which hinders us socially. This hindrance is a double whammy because it not only causes us to be anxious, but it causes us to stay anxious. You might wonder “how can I practice talking if I have no one to talk to?” Well there is a way, do some talking exercises; I’ll give you an example of one. 
 

 All you need is a smartphone with a stopwatch. Spend 1 actual minute talking about a word, this word can be anything, lets say for example your word “music.” What you want to do is continually talk about that word for a full minute but it can’t be in your head, this MUST be done verbally. It will be something like this: “music, well if I have to choose a favourite genre, I’d say hip hop, but more specifically R&amp;B. Why R&amp;B? Well when it comes to rap these days, it’s not that hard to become successful, not it say it doesn’t require work but think about it, anyone can be a producer since we have apps like fruity loops, and garage band, your best friend could make tracks………” until a minute goes by. See how you do, are you able to continue talking or do you have to stop and think? Do this several times a day and you’ll get better. 
 

 All in all, these are all theories, you will NEVER get over social anxiety unless you practice practically. We are in this situation because we’re not chefs, we’re apprentice linemen. Don’t look down on hard work, don’t look down on transition. To be good is to get good, to get good comes from being bad. Acknowledge your failures, truly do, don’t just accept it, embrace it. You will fail, you will get embarrassed, but guess what? When you keep trying, when you persevere, you will become a master chef."
"I suppose it’s time to stop lurking and post a rambling story of my own.
 

 I (25f) crashed into the garage door after a reasonably good lesson with my dad (65m) - I drove around the streets in my residential area, managed to get up to a decent speed, and then absolutely lost all of that confidence when I wrecked havoc on my house upon return.
 

 Before you all can pass judgement, here's a few things you should know about me:
 

 \- I was involved in something that was legally classified as a ""major motor vehicle accident"" 7 years ago - I was not the driver at the time, my dad was, and the other driver was found very legally liable
 

 \- There is an ongoing legal case about this accident. I am currently dealing with the parties involved. My lawyer decided to withdraw from my case.
 

 \- I had shock/PTSD/Trauma symptoms after the event - I could not cope with physical therapy because I would vomit and my hair was falling out in clumps. I still think I have issues related to my hair
 

 \- I might have anxiety? After I hit the siding, I could not sleep the entire night. I just hit the siding yesterday, if that makes sense (been up over 24 hours and trying to pretend to my parents that everything is okay)
 

 \- I think my doctor gave me a diagnosis for generalized anxiety but I'm unsure. My dad told me getting an official diagnosis will impact my job future.
 

 \- I was not a driver before as I was kind of afraid of it. I have never taken lessons.
 

 \- Yes, I still live with my parents. I currently work a 1-day-a-week part-time job where my ""supervisor"" misses out on the payroll for months at a time (she does pay me what I'm owed eventually). This part-time job is online due to COVID, but before I was doing it in-person.
 

 \- My mom (53f) and dad are okay with me not paying rent. I do clean my shared bathroom, help with the cooking and cleaning, do my own laundry, etc. I can cook meals on my own.
 

 \- I also have issues with eating three square meals a day. I have to sneak Twinkies into my room via my brother (23m) because I think my mom will be massively disappointed in me if I outright put it on our grocery list. I feel like a child about this.
 

 \- I am also doing a very tiny side-hustle as a digital artist - making paid commissions for people.
 

 \- I have graduated with a BA in the utterly useless liberal arts ""Communications and Media"" in late 2020. However, I managed to complete my first freelance project with my university, and worked full-time remote in 2021 for three months for a startup, where I also made them a comic.
 

 \- I am planning on returning to school to do a Masters in ""computational media design"" - it's under the Science umbrella, but it's a degree program that is about designing video games.
 

 So I've recently been ""hyping myself up"" to get back into trying to drive, and my parents have been super supportive, but I don't know if they are the best people to start me off. With how the siding broke I barely have pedal control.
 

 Anyway, I cried all day after the mishap and stayed awake reading Reddit all night. I've decided that it's time to spill my guts to a bunch of strangers and pray that I don't come off as an entitled a\*\*\*\*\*e.
 

 I'm really, really scared of driving. The first time I sat in the driver's seat this week, I cried for most of the ""lesson"". You all know what happened yesterday.
 

 Lately I've just been feeling lost and exhausted (I should also mention that I have a non-existent sleep schedule - sometimes I'm up 36 hours, sometimes passed out for 16 hours straight). I don't know what to do any more.
 

 We can definitely afford get everything fixed. I can also pay for it, but...I have this weird relationship with money. I don't know what to say about this issue without sounding completely off my rocker.
 

 I feel like a leech and a slob. I feel like I'm a huge drain plug for the family energy and resources. And I'm just sitting here with my spinning brain thinking ""maybe this next social media post will do well! maybe I will get another commission so I don't have to think! maybe I should give up on everything and look for a braindead job so I don't feel like a leech!"" But I also have huge issues with discipline and motivation. Lately the only things I do are draw like a maniac and play too much Genshin.
 

 My parents are really supportive of me even though I feel like I'm causing them too much grief.
 

 What are all of your thoughts? Should I just pull myself up by my diaper? Am I making a bigger deal out of living than necessary?"
"Was talking to my mom today about my health anxiety and to my surprise she said she went through the same thing in her late 20s and early 30s.
 

 I'm 29 and suffer from severe health anxiety where I think every symptom is some sort of cancer. Feels glad to know that my Mom struggled with the same issues when she was my age.
 

 If you suffer from health anxiety I suggest talking to your parents as maybe there's some hereditary connection when it comes to this disease. My mom said what triggered her health anxiety was divorcing my dad, and recently I broke up with my ex of 8 years which resulted in depression and now this anxiety.
 

 For anyone going through this just remember you aren't alone. What helps me is sticking to a healthy schedule, working put every day, eating healthy, and spending quality time outside worth my dog. Hope this helps!"
"I’m (26f) currently on a work trip with a few of my coworkers, most of whom I’ve known for years, but haven’t seen in person since covid started. I’m decently close with one person in particular and the rest I just have a normal professional relationship with.
 

 Last night everyone went out to celebrate a big milestone during the trip and had a great time. I was definitely pretty drunk by the end of the night and getting home is a little hazy, but I woke up with good memories of the night before and wasn’t concerned that anything had happened.
 

 Anyways, no one had texted me this morning and I wasn’t sure what the plan for the day was so I reached out to the coworker I’m closer with and asked what she was up to. She said she was going to breakfast with another person on the trip and that I could come, which I agreed to, but then she texted and said they were actually leaving right now for breakfast and that we could meet up later. This seemed odd to me since we’re all in the same hotel and I could have been ready to head out whenever, but it felt like she didn’t want me to come?
 

 I think I’m reading into it a bit too much but now I’m freaking out worried that I did something wrong last night and that’s the reason I’m not being invited along today. I don’t really have a track record of doing things out of character while drunk though so I’m just really confused and anxious.
 

 TLDR; Got drunk with coworkers who I haven’t seen in a while and now it feels like no one wants to hang out with me"
"I don't know where to post this. I am 25 year old female and have been talking to a guy for a while and we both know we like each other and want a relationship when circumstances allow. He knew I liked him and always showed he cared about me and will always be my friend before he ever initiated anything flirty or sexual between us (sexting) and he was always respectful and asked permission and never made me do anything I was not comfortable with.
 

 I was flattered and felt really good after the first time it happened, and we both tried initiating again but I am having conflicting feelings. Part of me feels so confident and empowered and I want to continue exploring this part of our relationship, but another part of me feels like a whore and that I shouldn't have done it and that it's wrong for me to have enjoyed it or wanted it. I think I have internalized shame when it comes to sex. We don't talk about it in my house at all (I still live with my parents) and I was raised on ""wait until marriage."" I am also still a virgin and this is the first time I have ever done anything like this. I was really nervous and didn't really know how to act.
 

 I also think he has mixed feelings too. He apologized after the first time initiating it because he thought he overstepped my boundaries and he didn't want me to think that was all he was after. He said he felt ""terrible"" and that I deserved better, and I told him how I felt conflicted too, and he assured me he wasn't taking advantage of me, just flirting. He said he shouldn't have done it and he feels bad too.
 

 I want to be able to move past these conflicting feelings about it because I don't want things to feel weird anymore. I don't know how to approach it mentally or how to talk about it more with him. I have not told anyone else either."

I have anxious attachment style and I have autism as well. I'm 28 and I've never had a relationship last more than 2 months. at this point I feel no ones gonna understand or love me and I'll be alone forever. do girls not like guys that are clingy and sensitive? do I have to change?
"You are awesome, you are the best. You’re not worthless, you’re not weird, you’re on a journey. A journey to discover yourself. You are just as valuable as others. The things you have to say are just as important as the things others have to say. Your opinions are just as valuable. Disagreeing is ok, doubting is ok. Bonds are formed from disagreements NOT agreements. Your time is valuable, you are amazing, never forget that, your time is valuable and you are amazing. Keep a smile on and have a great day whoever you are, each day is a day forward, you will get over this, this is only temporary. I send you my love, support, and a virtual hug 🤗 ❤️ we can do it! We can conquer this!"

"I am 27 years old and I finallly came to the conclusion that I need help with Anxiety. I signed up for therapy and will have my first session in a couple of days. Prior to the therapy session, I met with a prescriber to discuss medication. They recomended starting me off on Zoloft or Lexapro.
 

 In general I tend to think of medication as a last resort, not just for things like this, but in all aspects. For example I rarely used medinces perscribed to me for pain after surgeries and would only use them if absolutely necesarry. I don't even like taking ibuprofen for a headache unless it is unbearable.
 

 Given that, I am trying to figure out whether or going on anxiety medication is necessary for me or not. I am worried about going on something for the rest of my life and am a little concerned about the side effects. On the other hand, I have been reading some posts on here about how much meds helped people.
 

 I am hoping to hear from some people that have been on any of these medications and what their experiences were. Also if anyone has any thoughts on whether or not someone that is new to this whole Anexiety improvement journey should jump into meds or just try therapy first and see how that goes.
 

 I always kind of ignored my anxiety and told myself that since I have been able to graduate from college with a good degree, hold down a great job for several years and maintain good relationships that my anxiety must not be that bad. But as time goes by I am starting to feel like it is getting worse and is negatively impacting my happiness and is leading my to lean on stimulants and alcohol too much, which doesn't seem like a long term healthy way of handling this.
 

 I have also had a couple of concussions in the last few years so I am not sure how much that plays into what I am going through.
 

 I would really appreciate it if some people could speak to their experiences or have any encouragement or advice for someone just starting out in therapy and potentially medication.
 

 Please reach out if I can add additional context to my situation to help clarity where I am at.
 

 Also, I was reading some other posts on this sub about people being tired all of the time. I have spent years trying to figure out medically why to no avail. I am starting to wondering if my axiety is causing it. Can anyone speak to any experiences or epiphanies they have had with this?
 

 Thanks!

"So I already posted something about this before but it was more of a vent. This is more of a flailing desperate attempt to figure out what to do. I have a jury summons tomorrow morning. I'm crossing my fingers that somehow despite it being the weekend they might still update my status as ended so I don't have to go but I know my chances are slim to none. 
 

 I know myself well, even if I manage to get any sleep at all, tomorrow morning will be hell on earth. My anxiety is gonna have a field day(it's already pregaming right now). Given that info, I was wondering if any of you have called in sick to your jury summons because of anxiety and how that went? 
 

 I'm willing to try going but should I find that my anxiety is just too much I'd like to have some sort of a plan B. It kind of scares me, the idea of calling in, cause idk if they'd consider sickness caused by anxiety a good enough reason. Besides that I know some places will just have you reschedule while others might not be so easy going. All this legal stuff freaks me out. I don't want to be held in contempt, sent to jail, or fined but I also would rather not have to have a mental break down in front of a bunch of people.
 

 I don't really have any medication that can help other than propranolol but all that does is slow my heart rate. The last time I took it to try and help during a stressful event I still felt short of breath and really nauseous(which was honestly kind of new). I ended up having to hide away from people for like an hour till I felt somewhat better, even then after another hour or so I started feeling really anxious again.
 

 Idk what to do. I know jury summons isn't really that bad, most normal people just think it's boring but, for me, having so much wait time will just lead to me obsessing over how I'm feeling. I can't really distract myself that well because I'll constantly be anticipating being called up which could be within the first hour, could be multiple hours, or possibly not at all. On top of that, it's early in the morning which I have a pretty bad track record with too. Early mornings like that usually result in me feeling nauseous, which results in me not being able to eat much. You can't eat in the assembly room but you can't really leave in case they have an announcement so I'd have to wait. If I wait too long I start to feel really shaky and weak(I'd say hypoglycemic but I've been tested for that and apparently I don't have it, maybe I'm just in starvation mode all the time so I run out of energy/nutrients fast).
 

 Anyways, any advice is welcome."
Im 28 male. I have been very shy since i was a kid and didnt have friends. And after high school i isolated myself for many years. Recently i got a job washing dishes at a resturant. My coworkers are really kind to me but i really talk. I dont know what to say. Im a boring person. But i would like to change. How do i become better at socializing with people. And how do i become good at having conservations.
Had anyone tried Luvox? I know it’s for OCD but I was given that for said OCD and panic disorder. I’m bipolar and am already on 5 medications. I just wanna know about side effects and if it has either worked or given anyone trouble
"I (28m) have aspects of social anxiety and notice it largely when talking with people I view as smart and they start bringing up some complex idea. As they are explaining it, I often go through this cycle of “oh no, they’re explaining something complicated, you better pay attention or they’ll find out your dumb”. Then of course I’ve zoned out for a few seconds, now playing catch up and I either nod along praying they think Im following or, if I’m feeling brave, ask them to repeat. There’s a major imposter syndrome component I know, but I’m just wondering if anyone else struggles with this kind of thing/ has any recommendations?"
"So hey there, some might have read my update with my first make out with my boyfriend. Well ever since then I felt… different… I don’t know if sexy is the right word or not but something makes me feel bolder… 
 

 It came to a head on my date yesterday. A part of me just wanted to make out again and I knew we couldn’t do it at home cause my family were there. So in the car before he’s about to drive to head home… I suddenly hug and kiss the same way as before. The thing is I used to NEVER be this bold! I should be happy about this new side to build confidence…
 

 But in the end I keep thinking what if it scares him off or I go to far… so far he seems very happy with this so I guess I shouldn’t worry but has anyone else felt different around their significant other?"
"Hey all,
 

 I (28M) am having a bit of a rough go currently. I've been perpetually single my entire life and the only person that I've been in a relationship with (and I thought I loved) dumped me at the first sign of problems in November. 
 

 I've been trying to be social and meet people and that has been going fairly well. But when it comes to dates, I have been consistently stood up, where my dates don't even arrive at the location. 
 

 When I talk to my friends about this, they say I move things forward too quickly. I started doing that with dates because my anxiety would get the best of me and I'd assume that they didn't like me... now the opposite has happened and they *actually* don't like me. It's infuriating to find that after so long of working on myself, all I've done is overcorrect. 
 

 Has anyone else experienced this, and what did you do?"
"I (26M) had a huge panic attack after taking my Xanax dose. I whole body went numb, I was having trouble breathing, I felt nauseous, I thought I was having either a stroke or a heart attack. I spent an hour on the suicide hotline. I was ready to go to the hospital. I’m afraid to go to sleep tonight. I’m afraid I won’t wake up. I’m tired of being on so many meds. I want to take back my life!"
"If you've just been through something very stressful or a time of high anxiety, be easy on yourself. I know instinctually we expect to just bounce back immediately after said stressor is gone but high levels of stress take a toll on both your mind and body. It'll take some time to heal. You might continue to feel stressed(not as much as before but still), be extra prone to anxiety triggers, physically drained, tense, achey, sour stomach, nausea, etc. 
 

 And before you freak out about how you feel, think back to the basics before you jump to something scary. Did you eat enough today? What did you eat? Did you drink enough water today? How much sleep did you get this past week? How sound was that sleep? Did you have to take a different medication recently? What's your posture been like? Any constant muscle tension? Have you socialized much recently? Have you gone outside recently? Think of these questions not judgmentally but objectively(sometimes it's hard to take perfect care of yourself, it's not something to beat yourself up over). Say you're feeling really fatigued lately. If you've barely eaten anything and been getting poor sleep then it's not surprising at all that you'd be tired. That's on top of chronic anxiety which can cause unpleasant physical and mental symptoms even when you're doing everything else right. Just because you feel crappy, doesn't mean you have some scary life threatening disease. It sucks to feel like that but try not worry yourself over things that, at the moment, are just fantasy. 
 

 Granted if you feel like this all time(like me), I'd recommend seeing a therapist and/or psychiatrist, maybe even going for a regular doctors visit if you haven't gone in a long time just to check in on things. Basically what I'm saying is, don't scare yourself into a panic over your physical symptoms but if you feel like they are interrupting your life it might be a good idea to seek help. And there's nothing wrong with seeking help either. If someone is having trouble seeing things clearly, they go to an optometrist for help. This is the same thing. For some reason or another our body/brain isn't working how it should for us to lead a healthy life. It's not our fault and it's not shameful to need help.
 

 Hope ya'll have a good week :)"
"Hello all!
 I'm getting married in a few months and my anxiety is at an all time high. I love my fiance. He's kind, caring, supportive and so much more. But I am freaking out about taking a big step. I was married previously and it didn't work out. I know this time is different, but I can't help but to be nervous about the whole thing. I love hom so much and I can't picture my life without him. I want it to work. 
 

 Any advice on how to deal with anxiety and unpleasant feelings? Thanks!"
"Google has literally caused so much unnecessary anxiety in my life it's actually fucking unbelievable.
 

 I've had this ALS fear probably 5 times in my life and am currently on this terrible obsession with it which started as just one twitch in my shoulder and has no moved into body twitches and cramps. 
 

 I'm so fucking over Google. Like the odds of having this stupid disease is literally like .0025% yet Google shows ALS as the top choice when you look up muscle twitches/cramping.
 

 How does that make any sense?
 

 FUCK YOU, GOOGLE!"
"I think a big part of me being a people pleaser is connected to social anxiety. I’m in a situation where my coworker is clearly avoiding me due to something I did? Either way, the past me would try to resolve this and even ask why they’re being like that but now, I just don’t care. Deep down within me, I will acknowledge though that I’d like for us to be on good terms because I’ve never been in a situation like this before, I’m always that guy who gets along with everyone. I’m now quite indifferent about the way she’s treating me and essentially just matching her energy, but it’s never been that way for me. Does anyone else have this tendency to be on good terms with everyone? Does this cause social anxiety?"
"Over a year ago I started working as an Office Administrator for an electrical company. I work from home, with the business lines forwarded to my cell. So I don’t have the boss or owner of the company (or anyone for that matter) around when I am working. As nice as that is, it means I can’t quickly ask the person next to me for clarification, guidance or help. 
 

 My boss will often send me a text asking me to reschedule work for another day. This means I have to call the contractor and ask to move the work around. It sounds really simple when I’m typing this but there is something about talking to men I see in an “authority” type role (or any man who is significantly older or more knowledgeable in an area) that almost always leaves me crying. I can usually shake it off, but sometimes I will hyperventilate and beat myself up for the rest of the day. I will feel small, stupid, inadequate and worry about what he thinks of me. It will impact me even when I am done work and I’ll be left feeling hyper sensitive for the rest of the day. And god forbid the contractors are the ones calling ME… I sometimes get so scared to pick up that I just won’t and I let it go to voicemail. I know that isn’t the right approach and probably isn’t good for the business, but sometimes it feels like too much. I’m not knowledgeable in electrical work so I often cannot answer the questions they have for me in regards to the work. Which isn’t really my job anyhow as an administrator and should be directed to my boss but I have a very hard time articulating that. I feel like men are far more short, to the point, and generally colder than when I speak to women. I just end up playing very small, and it does not translate well. I hate the feeling because I know how far I’ve come, and THIS is the one thing that’s going to still impact me??? Ugh. 
 

 I used to struggle with pretty bad general anxiety, and as I got older it improved but turned into social anxiety (which I’d never experienced). Now, anxiety hardly dictates my life, I’m on a great medication and I have all the coping skills I need. I wasn’t having these flare ups until I started working this job. 
 

 Does anyone else feel like this? As a child I was pretty scared of my dad. My parents were divorced. I definitely didn’t have a bad father but he had a tough love approach and could be kind of tumultuous. My mom and my step dad were the opposite, I always felt heard, loved and nurtured. I am sure there is likely something there that has carried into my adulthood. But I guess I just want to know if anyone else experiences this and if so, how do you deal with it? 
 

 TL;DR I know nothing about electrical work, I’m just an administrator and I am terrified of talking to large (male) contractors we do business for because I feel stupid."
"I (27M) am worried about potentially developing schizophrenia eventually. My sister (30) is suffering from this disease right now. 2 of my moms aunts also had it. My parents did not have it (they both passed away 11 and 2,5 years ago). I know the onset of symptoms typically occurs in the 20s for males. I smoked weed very often (almost daily when I was in a smoking mode, but I also took a few tolerance breaks anywhere from 2-5 months) the past 7 years but recently I decided to stop. I also tripped on LSD 9 times within one year, but the last trip I had was almost 5 years ago. I know LSD, weed, and stressful situations can trigger dormant mental illnesses in people, but I am wondering if schizophrenia would already have been triggered and active in me given my history. 
 

 I didn’t know I had a family history of the disease until about 2,5 years ago, so please don’t shame me for my ignorance. I also just found out there was a link between weed and schizophrenia in the past year, and thankfully I have conquered my battle with weed, even though it took some time. Do you think my previous drug usage will come back to haunt me? If someone could provide some numbers for what my odds look like, that would be nice… as far as I can tell I am not in a prodromal phase, but after leaving the weed behind I am worrying myself a lot thinking about all this. Thanks for any input."
"I am having a hard time nailing down whether I am truly experiencing OCD or Anxiety or both.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Does anyone have any experience with one or both that can chime in?"
"I feel like I have always had anxiety/OCD, but it has never really negatively effected my life like it does now.
 

 It feels like it is really getting in the way of my daily life.
 

 Being that I made it 27 years without it having huge effects, does that mean that it can go away or will this just be my life now?

 Any thoughts that people have from experience?"
"25F - Recently (1 month ago) moved to Los Angeles. Let me start off by saying that I’m from San Francisco and have been driving since I was 15, got my license the day I could. I’m a good driver, clean driving record and NEVER had anxiety toward driving before. But ever since moving down to Los Angeles, I get panic attacks almost every time I get on a highway. It’s gotten so bad that a couple times I’ve had to pull over and ask a friend in the car to drive for me, something I never did in the last 10 years of driving. I’ve tried avoiding highways and taking side streets instead but it’s not always possible, and if it is possible, it makes the drive 2-3x longer.
 

 I’m at a loss for what to do. LA is a driving city and I don’t want to be anxious every time I have to drive on the highway. This is all new to me, since I drive in other cities, states and even countries without any issues. Help."
"Sigh… I’m sure anyone who seen my previous posts is thinking… wow jumps from good to bad to confused pretty damn quickly… and if that’s the case, thanks for following this rollercoaster called Chara’s Anxiety (not my real name but just role with it). Now what is she talking about this time?
 

 I think it’s a combination of things… I’ve been feeling different, dealing with romance now in my late 20’s when most have dealt with it in their teens. Like the hormones that increase my anxiety went into overdrive. I’ve become more bold which seems like a good thing but I’ve always been more timid in certain situations that I still deal with but pushing my boundaries (while a great thing) keeps throwing me for a loop.
 My anxiety also comes from not knowing what’s to come (like I’m sure a majority of us are) and in dating relationships that’s always the case. I’m still scared to tell my boyfriend about my general anxiety and more so of my autism. My dad is almost 100% certain my bf has autism too but I’m still scared… 
 

 I wanna feel like I can tell him these things, I wanna let him know what’s he’s getting involved with. Times were together I’m on my best behavior but outside I’m a mess. I also want to know anything he might struggle with so I can support him, buts he’s even more quiet than I am…
 

 Again I just…. I’m usually really good at controlling/understanding my anxiety and emotions… but today…
 

 All I can do is sigh and think out into the distance."
"I (27F) married the love of my life last year (27M) and it was the best decision I ever made. With that being said, I didn’t have the best upbringing, my parents created a very toxic environment for me and by default I had a challenging time making friends/ being successful in relationships. That is, until I met my husband. I’ve been with him for a total of 3 years, and they’ve been the most stable years of life. However, now that I’ve grown accustomed to the stability, I’m PARANOID about it going away. I constantly am worried that something is going to happen to my husband, and I truly don’t know how I could get through life without him. (I know how unhealthy that sounds.) Each day I’m worried he will get hit by a car on his way to work, or sporadically get diagnosed with cancer.. etc. I genuinely want to know if anyone else has experienced these feelings and how they coped with them. I really don’t want to spend the rest of my life freaking out every day. 
 

 Note: I feel that it’s important to mention that I NEVER used to be like this. I used to be an impulsive, say “yes” to everything kind of girl… I don’t really know what happened. 😞"
"Hello!
 

 So long story short I've struggled with anxiety/panic attacks for about 10 years now. I've had my ups and downs, some years better than others. Lately it's been getting bad again so I decided for once to start seeing a therapist + consider meds. I started therapy last week, and also saw a psychiatrist and was prescribed Zoloft. Just 25 mg a day, super mild dose.
 

 Idk why but last night was the first pill I had to take and boy was I anxious (ironic lol). Took me like 5 hours of working up the courage to do it.
 

 Finally took it right before I fell asleep and ""started"" the path.
 

 Slept fine, woke up fine, and was fine most of the day. Which was comforting.
 

 Now it's night time again and time to take pill 2.
 

 Past 4 hours though I've been drowsy. Which apparently is an expected side effect for the first week. Which is fine, no big deal. But I've also had an upset stomach and slight nausea. Which apparently is also an expected common side effect the first week, not a big deal.
 

 So I decided to go to bed a bit early today bc I was so tired + a lil anxious. I'm in bed now and I'm shaking. Nothing extreme but, basically have the chills as if I'm cold (I'm not cold though).
 

 Is this an issue? Or is this literally me causing the chills from overthinking everything and making myself nervous? I've done it before in the past with other things so I wouldn't be surprised. But it did come a bit out of nowhere tonight, yes I was a bit anxious but nothing too bad. Now the shaking is making me a bit more nervous.
 

 Just wanted to make this post to get some answers I guess, find comfort, idk.
 

 Do I take pill #2? Stop? Is the shaking an issue? Is it just me causing it?
 

 Thanks!"
"I'm 25 and now I reached the point where I'm having really bad anxiety and panic attacks (i wasn't fully diagnosed, my psychologist did send me to a psychiatry to check it out but I was scared to do so and end up getting on meds) but now whenever I have something more rough going on my life I just crumble under it and I want to throw up immediately when it happens, everything just hurts and I can't even eat anymore. I don't know what to do."
"I’ve (27f) struggled with anxiety my whole life due to a trauma filled childhood. Im currently in therapy with an integrative therapist and we’re doing a lot of work involving mainly EMDR and psychodynamic therapies. I’ve been working with her since November 2021 on a weekly basis. I feel like I’ve won the lottery with my therapist and I’ve made a lot of progress with her. 
 

 In the past year I’ve stopped smoking weed, stopped drinking alcohol completely, started practicing yoga, eating a mostly healthy diet. I’ve become a lot more stable in my emotions and don’t tend to have suicidal ideation much anymore- really only once a month when I’m due on my monthly’s 🙃
 

 However, despite my progress, my anxiety is still there. I don’t really have panic attacks but I have a constant feeling of impending doom- like I might die or my whole life will crumble any minute. I have a heavy/cold sensation in my chest most of the time (almost like a constant adrenaline rush) I struggle in social situations and I massively overthink. These sensations go away when I do yoga but the sensation comes back immediately after I’ve finished a session and it’s unrealistic for me to do yoga 24/7. I’ve tried breathwork but it doesn’t really work for me. 
 

 I’ve never wanted to go on medication as I’m worried about becoming reliant on it, and also the side effects. I struggle with my weight and it’s a massive trigger for me. There’s not been any recent events to contribute to the anxiety.
 

 I know I probably need to see my GP, but I’m scared to become reliant on something, especially something that may cause me to gain weight. What are peoples experiences with going on medication short term? I’m wondering if a short term medication might give my brain a nudge, but I don’t want to feel worse if I come off… any advice would be appreciated!"
"So I (F25) recently started to a person (M29). A little bit about me is that I grew up in a abusive household. I never really had any decent male role models. And moreover my relationship from 16 years old to now have been absolutely terrible. They were filled with gaslighting, emotional abuse and lack of communication. I’ve recently realized that because of my past I have a terrible amount of relationship anxiety. 
 

 So this person I’ve been talking for a couple of weeks. He asked me out but didn’t confirm the plans the day before so I felt like he didn’t want to go out with me I spent that night before stressing and feeling the most amount of worrying. I expressed to him I want my partners to be excited to see me and create a concrete plan to hang out with me. He said he gets it and he would plan something for the following weekend. I said okay cool. The weekend comes and he said yes the plans are still on for Saturday. He said he’d call and let me know the plan. However I get a message saying he’s drinking with his friends and can’t call me. So I didn’t respond. Next day he messages me and we talk through my concerns. And he understands my perspective and says that we should still go out. We go out and it’s great. We click right away. He tells me he thinks Im amazing and he likes my communication and my honesty about everything. 
 

 The next day, he’s MIA-ish. I only get one goodmorning message. Nothing until the end of the night. The next day very minimal communication. And at this my anxiety is getting higher. Same thing on Wednesday but I get so tired I ask him straight up what’s up cause his communication has changed. He said it because of work and he’s not always like this. He said he wants to talk to me and that it’s just his work. He said he’d call but we kept missing each other either he got busy or I did. And when we finally spoke on the phone it was great. We vibes. Sorted things out and it seemed like we were on the same page. But after the phone call then it was back to the terrible terrible communication habits. Examples leaving me on open on Snapchat, watching my story and not responding and just a lack of excitement and even desire to speak to me. I’m so CONFUSED. I don’t know if I should stay or should I leave? I know I need to be better with my anxiety but is he the right person to do it with."
"So I have anxiety, which I'm pleased to say has greatly improved over the last few months, however there is one symptom that I just can't shift. I have a twitch in my diaphragm and I can't stop doing it. Sometimes it's involuntary but most of the time I do it on purpose. I find it hard not to do it and it's starting to affect my perception of my breathing. Because it's tense all the time from the twitching, I think it's making it harder to breathe, but I only notice this if I'm thinking about it.
 

 Does anybody have any tips on how I can stop doing this as it's starting to affect me? 
 

 Thank you"
"Copied from a comment, i just posted, but i felt like i needed to post. 
 

  I(27f) am RIDDLED with anxiety in my relationship. Past trauma, i guess is the reason. Litterally the week before i met my current bf(24m), I convinced myself that I would be alone forever and that it was a good thing because guys can't be trusted. Then I met HIM, it wasn't instant ""love at first sight"", he definitely pursued me. I was not in a place where I wanted a relationship or even thought it was possible for me to get involved in another one. After a couple months of seeing each other I started being convinced that he was a nice, loving, caring and trustworthy guy. And he is! I've totally fallen head over heals for my man. We have spent a wonderful year together, even live together! But my crippling anxiety is taking control of my life. I cannot think straight. All I think about is things that could go wrong or convince myself they are already wrong. Things like: why he doesn't want to tell me things. Is there something wrong? Is he cheating on me emotionally? Does he even like me? Are playing on a loop 24/7. 
 

 I am working with a therapist and i have had multiple conversations with him about my anxiety and fears. But they are not going anywhere. It Litterally consumes my mind at all times of the day. I'm terrified that i can't deal with relationships and that I'm going to have to end things or he won't be able to handle me bringing up the same insecurities and anxieties and have to end things for himself. 
 

 I know that my therapist gives me the ""how to""s that are going to take time to become good at. I really am working hard to make it so I don't ruin this. But is it too late? Am i just too much for a relationship? Is it better for me to try and overcome my anxiety issues on my own and come back for a relationship when I am ready? Should i bow out now and not waste mine or his time and energy? I am so conflicted. I don't know what to do. I feel like I can't breathe and I know this isn't healthy."
"This is something I wrote about my anxiety and depression; and hoping someone can relate, because I am going through a really rough time. The people in my personal life are there for me, but I know they don’t truly understand what I’m going through. 
 

 Its like feeling extremely homesick but there is no home to go back to, and there never will be. Like falling into a void of eternal terror and fear and I’ll never get out. Like every day I’m grieving a life I once knew, a person I once was, and I am sure it’s gone forever. Feels like it was so long ago since anything felt familiar or safe. I miss me. And I’m scared I’ll forget what it even felt like to be the person I once was. I want me back so bad I would be willing to give up a lot. You know that moment when you wake up from a nightmare and you are so, so relieved it wasn’t real? But the part right before you do, when it all is still so real, so horrifying, so gut wrenching… I’m still waiting to wake up. Like I’m stuck in the worst part, and I thought I would wake up by now, roll over in bed and see my dogs sleeping peacefully beside me and think with overwhelming relief “thank god” like I’ve done with all of my bad dreams in the past. But now there is no relief. Will there ever be relief? Will that part ever happen? I can’t believe this is my reality. My thoughts are jumbled and everything feels “dark” things even look dark. It doesn’t just feel like anxiety. It feels like FEAR. I wonder every day if this is the day I will finally lose my mind. Nothings even wrong in my life right now, besides me. I have everything I need. I mean maybe by others standards, I’m not living a dream life..but I’m financially stable enough, I work with dogs all day, I have the most wonderful boyfriend who has stuck by my side through thick and thin. I have good friends, and a family who loves me and is there for me. But even when I’m right next to them I feel 10 million miles away. I can’t remember anything anymore, like the days pass but they’re just disappearing as they pass. I feel half disoriented all the time. I feel like my life is over, and I am aware of how dramatic that sounds. But it’s how it feels for me right now. Can anyone who has ever felt similar to this, tell me they got through it and there is another side? A light at the end of the tunnel? I have a good therapist, I meditate, I’m trying to find a good medication, I’ve tried natural supplements, I eat healthy, I have a good sleeping schedule, I don’t drink or do drugs, I exercise. But still I literally feel like my brain is broken. Every day is a repeat of the same feelings. I feel trapped inside myself. It’s like living in a constant-almost-panic attack, except there’s never any come down from it. I feel scared and alone, and am really afraid that I am losing my mind."
"Hey everyone. 25F who has been struggling with unexplained anxiety around my relationships. From what I've read online, I can't find anyone with a similar experience.
 

 I started noticing it when I fell in love with a boy overseas. We dated online for 7 months, and finally met up for a week-long vacation. When it came to sleeping at night in the same bed, I was overwhelmed with anxiety and I have no idea why. I'd try and sleep, but that feeling in my stomach and throat would not quit. I ended up sleeping on the couch the entire time. I barely slept, and during the day I was anxious and rarely ate. I lost 10lbs during that week.
 

 This was in 2017, and from here on out I haven't been able to share a bed with anyone unless I was wasted drunk, or pumped myself full of sleeping pills. I've even tried with friends, to no avail. It's truly my biggest insecurity and the downfall of my last relationship. I want nothing more than to sleep peacefully next to someone I love. Oddly enough, I have accidentally fallen asleep while cuddling, or watching TV but if I intentionally try and sleep, I will have a panic attack. It's frustrating because I have no thoughts when this happens. Nothing in my brain. My body simply reacts. I also feel this way when doing things couples do. Like visiting his family, or sometimes seeing his text on my screen makes me anxious, or a date. I cannot tell you how many times I've had to excuse myself to go throw up when we went out to dinner because I was too anxious. 
 

 I'm currently in love with someone new, and terrified. I'm terrified my anxiety will get in the way. I feel as if it is blocking me from truly giving myself to someone and finding peace. I'm a very independent person and as much as I hate to admit it, being alone is easier for me. 
 

 I suspect I have commitment issues, commitment anxiety, perhaps PTSD from my abusive relationship or other encounters throughout my life (perhaps a mixture). But I really can't figure it out, and I'm so frustrated with myself because of this. It's definitely affected my confidence in my feelings towards others because ""maybe my anxiety is a sign that this isn't the right relationship for me"". I'd like to decide that for myself based on other factors. I have found an amazing partner and I don't want to let anxiety get in the way. I think if I get past this, I could truly be happy and live a good life with him"
"Since I suck at socializing and meeting people, for the past few months I've been going to MeetUp events to socialize and meet people. I've had mixed results in making close friends, but overall it's been my main way that I use to have some sort of a social life. In my area, there are plenty of social groups but few groups that are active and consistently host events every week. I've become a regular at 2 of the groups, one is a weekly kickball game group and the other is a social group hosted by the same people as the kickball group.
 

 For the past few months, I've been mainly just going to their events and don't have much of a social life outside of that. Since I never have anything else going on, I'm always able to go to their events and I don't miss any of them. Lately for the past few weeks, people at these events have been commenting about how they see here me all of the time. I've been asked several times by people if I come to all of these events. Many people within the group who come and go on these events but don't come for every event commented how they see different people all the time but also always see me. People have taken note that I'm not just a regular, but a dedicated regular who shows up to all events. We do have other regulars, but I'm the regular who consistently shows up to all of their events and doesn't miss any.
 

 Since people have taken notice of me and how I come to every meetup, I've become extremely self conscious over this. Most people I meet in these MeetUp events have their own social lives outside of meetup, so most people show up for some events but they can't show up for all. I've been showing up for all of them and I'm worried people are getting the impression I'm a guy who has nothing better to do socially so I just come to meetups. When people make comments about me being a regular, there's usually no malice intent in their statement as they are just making an observation. But I can't stand it when I get attention like this. 
 

 Because of this, I'm now no longer going to keep going to every meetup event for this group. I don't even have fun or enjoy every meet. I'm going to look for other things to do instead of relying on this group for my entire social life. The group has a kickball game and more social events coming up. I'm going to skip kickball for the first time in weeks tomorrow and I'm also going to start skipping some of their social events now."
"Today I had this realisation that I had fear of disappointing my dad since I was a kid. He has always been very strict to everyone around him especially his family, bursts out on us if there was any little inconvenience or if he told us to do something and if it's little different that how he imagined then he'd go crazy and scold us.
 

 Every little things used to annoy him. So naturally I tried to make sure whatever I'm doing is exactly what he wants(can't believe I'm 26 yrs old now and I just realised this part that actually I was trying to please him and this was the reason I became kinda of people pleaser).
 

 I didn't want anyone else to feel bad and make sure everyone is happy with me and around me. This has really fucked up my life. I mean I do try to make other feel good but at my own expense of happiness but there is another savage part of me where I absolutely don't give a fuck and put people in their place which I did a few times with my dad.
 

 Anyways, the thing is I'm trying to understand if this is the correct analogy? Or am I misinterpreting my relationship with my father vs how it affects my life and there is some other issue with me?"
"Hello everyone... what a night. I've been having panic attacks since I was around 19 y.o (I'm 26 y.o now) and is the worst feeling ever. And, what makes it worst? The situation I always have that pushes it to come out. 
 

 I'm married since last summer, but being with my husband for 6 years. When I met him in University it was my first experience living outside and I had (before our relation) several days with bad panic attacks crying, being incapable to breath properly and lost. He was supportive, always, and when we moved out of our country everything was just fine... until last Christmas. It was WEIRD, no other possible word to describe it. My husband has lived back in my country for a few months to study, so I couldn't see him from September. I thought I was excited going back and seeing everybody, but when I arrived home I felt my family was no longer my family, my husband was a stranger in my mind and I just wanted to be alone. As usual, my boy tried to give me some room and, step by step, he got closer to me. For that month, I was in and out, kinda feeling better than when I arrived... but still off. I had to come back and he had to stay there for a few more months, so we said goodbye in the airport with tears and I couldn't stop thinking how could I spent such a bad holiday and do that to my husband after all I love him and care him. 
 

 After that, I've been perfect living again my daily life. Going work and counting in the calendar when will he come to visit me. Every time I saw a place that I liked, I could just take notes to go again there with my husband and... he said he's coming next week. For two weeks. I was happy. So, so happy I told everybody and is the perfect timing because I have holidays, so I can do tons of things with him again... and I had the panic attack last night. That's WHY I hate the situation why it comes. Why because of my husband? Is like my mind cannot accept changes and if I don't see him everyday when he comes back all fears come with him. I couldn't stop thinking how hard life is, the pressure living out of my country, far away from my family and the expectations around me: buy or rent a new place, have kids (thing that I started thinking is not the best idea with my ""problem""...), what should I do the next years (if go back or stay living here...) 
 

 I DO LOVE my husband, no doubt. I call him everyday, I always have him in mind and every time I talk to somebody is impossible for me not to mention him. People asked me if is because I do not longer love him but I'm having this even before we started dating... Maybe is just that, every time he comes, I just stuck my thoughts in a future that has not come yet. 
 

 Anybody with the same situation? Would be really helpful even tho I don't wish this situation to anybody else."
"Am I being played
 

 So I 25(F)have this ongoing crush with one of my male coworkers 24(M). I’m shy and he is also “shy” and is seen as the nice guy. I had originally thought the feelings were mutual but now I think I’m just being used as an ego boost. I work as a cashier and he is one of the supervisors who usually bags for the registers. There is another coworker 19 (F) that also has a massive crush on him even though she has a boyfriend which I’m sure everyone is aware of and she is a bit immature and flirts with everyone of the opposite sex. Anyways the male coworker would bag for me but be making ogly eyes and smile at the 19 year old. There clearly was pissing me off and I felt he was only bagging for me to make her jealous. This makes me feel like crap because I don’t want to be part of their childish games. I am sure she was making eyes at him it was just so uncomfortable for me. Before that I thought he had liked me but it was clearly just superficial. The thing is I know he knows what he was doing was making me feel uncomfortable but he was acting like I wasn’t even there. Of course he would look if I stretched over or something of that kind. Also when he would bag for her they didn’t even talk she just got right in his space helping him bag everything. I put off even talking to this guy because I had a feeling he wasn’t such a “nice guy”. What should I do if this happens again? I hate feeling played."
"First post! I have to mention how lovely it is to see that I'm not alone in the world with my feelings. Thank you for creating this safe space. 
 

 Now to get to my issue. I am someone who is naturally quite a worrier, and health and social anxiety have been present in my life throughout my teens and early twenties. I am 28 (this is somewhat important!)
 

 Despite this, I (thought) I had developed a method for battling both forms of anxiety. Simply by telling myself to grow up, move on and live my life or I'd regret it. For social anxiety, I would just tell myself to stop thinking about others and for health anxiety I would tell myself to assess my symptoms and if there weren't any that persisted, then to just accept it as something normal and move on. Doctors have actual patients to see. 
 

 That being said.... I was recently thinking about getting a dog. Naturally, my anxious ass decided to google diseases that humans can get from dogs and I came across something called brucellosis. To cut a long story short, it's very rare and would result in a human experiencing flu-like symptoms that can get worse over time if not treated, but can be treated quite easily. 
 

 Upon reading this, I recalled a time when I was in my early teens and had been playing with a neighbour's dog. As brucellosis can be transmitted via fluids like saliva or urine, I am now sick to my core with the notion that I must have somewhat caught it from the dog, and have been carrying it with me for 10+ years. 
 

 The thing is, I have no symptoms. I feel fine. I have always felt fine. Surely if I had this rare disease and have been carrying it around with me for 10+ years without symptoms/side effects then I am fine. 
 

 But my main worry is that now I'm an asymptomatic carrier of this disease and will somehow end up giving it to my family/friends. (No one in my family or friends have had flu-like symptoms and to my knowledge, brucellosis wouldn't just go away). 
 

 How do you combat the anxiety of thinking you're the exception to the rule? I have tried my usual tactic of listing symptoms and putting the disease into context (it's very rare, even if you catch it you would have symptoms) and I have nothing. So why do I feel this sense of dread? 
 

 I also think I'm freaked because to test for this, it's not just a normal blood test and I really don't want to waste any doctor's time for something I know I'm being silly about. I've actually had to take the day off work too because it has made me so anxious today thinking about it. 
 

 Any advice on how to cope would be appreciated!"
"Which has never happened. One girl ghosted me, while another broke up with me.
 

 Basically, she knows about my SA. I told her I wanted a relationship, but my anxiety has gotten pretty worse and I told her I don't want a relationship no more. I also said I can do friends with benefits, to which she obviously declined. I just took a shot. This is so not me and that's the first time I've ever suggested this, but it does feel kinda liberating.
 

 Any thoughts?"
"after having to reschedule surgery a few times, I’m finally getting it done Wednesday morning. 
 

 I’m not scared of the pain. I know it won’t be comfortable. 
 

 my fear, is that I’ll be that one out of whatever number, that dies. i had a panic attack today that was triggered by intrusive thoughts of my children having to suffer the loss of their mom. 
 

 The logical side of me knows that I’ll be okay, but the awful paranoia and anxiety tells me otherwise and I’m so scared. 
 

 I’m at the point that I keep fighting the urge to write letters to my kids, in case it happens. i feel like if I sit down to write them, that I’m giving in. 
 

 idk. I’m just venting and trying to ground myself but it’s so hard."
Does that mean that they are happy for that person or that that they like what they see? It definitely rules out being jealous or anything it’s just confusing.

"This is my first post ever. I’m a 29M and my gf is a 23F. On April 10 will be our 4 year anniversary. We were doing long distance for 3.5 years of our dating. We’ve always had an amazing connection. She’s very attractive and is a nerd so we’ve got a lot in common. However we have some differences. She’s more extroverted where I’m introverted. Anyways throughout our relationship because I was in the military I could only see her maybe one or two months out of the years at best. So now after all this time I got out of the military and had planned on starting my life with her. I’m currently staying with her mother as living situations are scarce or cost way too much where I am in Atlanta. I have a decent job but still cost of living is high right now. She loves attention and loves going out with her girl friends. Over the last year I’ve discovered while we were apart that she’s done things that I don’t agree with. She’s a firm believer in physical infidelity is less harmful than emotional infidelity. I disagree as I believe all types of infidelity is destructive towards relationships. I’m a bit more of an emotional being than she is. While we were in Miami celebrating her birthday I broke her trust and went through her phone where I discovered she gave some old fat guy a blowjob with her friend. I believe he was some sugar daddy type individual. When I told her I left our hotel and walked around. But decided to try to move past it, against my better judgement due to strong feelings for her. I wanted to marry her. Since then she went on spring break to Cancun with her sister. She and I weren’t on the best terms because I was going crazy after finding out the infidelity. My thoughts were what else would there be if I found out she did that with some old fat dude then what else is there that I don’t know about. She told me don’t go looking if I’m afraid of finding stuff. Anyways, after she returned from Cancun she’s added dudes on Snapchat and Instagram. In which I discovered some dude messaging her asking where her booty was and other messages. Most of the Snapchat stuff was obviously not saved. I’m a wonderful boyfriend that has gone above and beyond for this girl. I’m in a predicament with my living at her mothers. I’m meeting with a therapist this week, but I don’t know what the best thing to do is. Any advice would be appreciated. Yes I did emphasize my boundary that I do not want to share her with anyone else. She’s expressed that she and I are getting married. I just don’t want to make a mistake and screw myself. I know going through your partners phone isn’t right but I needed to know the truth which she wasn’t willing to tell me. Withholding information to me is still lying. It is causing me to lose sleep and feel serious depression. Please help."
Having an anxiety attack where I feel sick to my stomach and out of breath crying. I took to slowing my breath first off but I don’t want to go into overthinking and make it worse. I am in the flight zone in my head where I want to leave everything and delete social media not talk to anyone. I just want to know how to deal with these thoughts coz deep inside me I don’t want to fall weak. I want to get up and get strong but I can’t think of anything positive at the moment and i feel like a shit show at the moment.
"Ive had anxiety for about 15 years. I am 26 right now. 
 Ive been through therapy and currently on ssri
 Which completly changed my life for the better. But still a question remains
 

 One thing that ive noticed is that when i am outside i notice a mild rush of anxiety which progresses to become more and more uncomfortable. (This doesnt happen ALL the time but often)I dont consider myself to have social anxiety as iam comfortable around people i can speak freely and dont care what others think about me.
 

 But this is really annoying not knowing what my trigger is. Ive learn in therapy that i need to attach my thoughts to feelimgs. But i really cant find a thought or situation to connect my anxiety to when im outside. So i keep on spinning my wheels.
 

 What sugestions do you have? What have you tried?
 Shoukd i just practice mindfulness?accept those feelings in my body and be mindful? Keep on finding a trigger? Anything helps thanks."
"I'm 25 years old and I have horrible phone anxiety. I recently have had to make a doctor's appointment for the first time by myself but I've put it off for months now because I wasn't sure what I was supposed to say and it gave me so much anxiety to just think about it. 
 

 Then I came across this website for people learning English as a second language and it had a role play scenario of how to make a doctor's appointment and it took so much of the fear out of the equation now that I had an idea of how it was supposed to go and I wanted to share it here just in case it could help anyone else! :) 
 

 Even though it's simple for people without social anxiety this was weighing on me so heavily so I'm proud of myself and thankful to God for helping me grow in this area!
 

 Here's the link to the website with the doctor appointment phone call scenario :)
 

 https://www.thoughtco.com/making-a-doctors-appointment-1210351"
"Hello, I am a 25M who is in a really disturbing state. I have a record of having bad health anxieties and some ocd but this one happens to be more mental. 
 

 I am anxious about being depressed. I’ve had close friends and family who are suffering really bad depression and I’m anxious that I will be depressed, which is pretty much making me depressed. Whenever I wake up, i check in my mind whether i feel depressed. When I am doing some fun activities, I ask myself is this really happiness? I get triggered easily by happiness and depression words. I also sometimes get feeling of derealization. 
 

 I think this is all anxiety that is fueling the ocd thoughts and making me depressed. How can I get out of this cycle…please help!"
"At first I thought I was having health issues. I’d have heart palpitations, which led to shortness of breath, which then spiraled into a full blown panic attack. 
 

 

 These occurrences have been happening daily and every time I go to do a remedial task (drive my car, go to the grocery store, etc.) I’ll start to feel the symptoms heighten. I feel “off” and “on edge” nearly 24/7. It’s absolutely unbearable. 
 

 

 Finally got in to see a doctor and prescribed me Xanax and Zoloft. The Xanax is the only thing helping me get through the day, but I’m afraid I’ll become dependent on it. Im on week 2 of the Zoloft and I haven’t felt any significant changes. 
 

 

 Just needed a place to vent. This is miserable. I’ve blown off dates, haven’t gone to the gym in months, and been ignoring responsibilities in fear of having a panic attack and passing out. The worst symptom is the trouble with breathing. It just comes out of no where and scares the shit out of me. It’s like I’m having a heart attack. 
 

 

 Any reassurance or advice would be great. Still feel like in the back of my mind that I have something wrong with me physically even though my blood work and EKG came back fine. Hope you’re all doing well in your journey!"
I am starting Lexapro today. I am only on 5mg but I’m graduating in a month and going out of town. I don’t drink nearly as much as I use to but I definitely would like to drink more then usual on vacation in a month. Any one have any experience with it that are positive? I am 25 and do have a pretty high tolerance. Pharmacist told me everyone is different and I could get some flu like symptoms.
"My (27F) boyfriend (26M) dumped be suddenly 4 days ago, after 3 stable and happy years. 
 

 Naturally, I expected to feel rather sad and depressed, and I've been able to handle that fairly well considering. 
 

 However, I am now feeling intense anxiety like I've not felt in years, not related to him or anything romantic, just general anxiety. Has it happened to anyone? Thanks!"
"Is anyone else so crippled by this that they can't watch tv or read? Anything relating to death or age/illness distresses me now and I can no longer enjoy everything I used to.
 And if so, has anyone come back from it? I can't enjoy any movies now. They were my favourite thing until a panic episode induced by medication 2 months ago triggered this fear"
"I'm 27 now, studied one bachelors degree, tried fulltime work, couldnt handle it with my SA (mainly all the social office life). That was a programmer job. Then I studied a second bachelors degree, a language, since I though studying a language for three years will help me get more comfortable talking in groups and in front of people. It didnt.
 

 Now I'm working an Analyst job. Had 1 month in the office for training and it was hell. I just couldnt deal with the office social life, couldnt hold conversations with anyone beyond asking a few questions, was constantly drained and super exhausted just because of the social situations.
 

 Now I'm in home office since 3 months and its bearable but all the team meetings and calls still affect me so much mentally, that I cant sleep well and am generally super unhappy and drained. We got told that starting May, we will have to go back to office. And I'm super scared of that and dont think I can handle this for long. 
 

 I want to be happy, I wanna be not stressed out all the time. Seeing how easy this all is for my coworkers and how easy they just hold conversations and socialize makes me depressed and it feels so unfair that I have to go through this endless struggle, and feeling unwell and stressed out due to the smallest social things. 
 

 I'm pretty much set on quitting the job the coming month because I want to have my peace. But at the same time I know that that won't make me happier either, because I wouldnt have a job and feel useless."
"Guy with social anxiety who also has very little friends to regularly talk to. I don't have regular chats with anyone and barely anyone teaches out to me to talk. I can go days without any notifications from a real person on my phone. Seeing how I am, I'm baffled as to how social people manage to talk all day to a large group of people all day everyday.
 

 I see people getting hundreds of different texts a day from all kinds of people. They have non stop social media notifications coming in at all times of the day especially on Instagram and Snapchat. They seemingly always have people to do things with. I'm trying to plan a trip for myself solo, but yet I see people going on trips and eating out with groups of people like every week. 
 

 I'm baffled as to how people manage to have such huge social circles and always have people to talk to. Who are these people? How close are you with them? How do manage to get texts from so many people? What are they talking about all day? I just don't get it. I'll go out and meet people I vibe with through events and meetups. We'll chat and we'll exchange numbers. Yet, they hardly ever reach back out to me and even when I reach out to them to try to chat, they don't seem interested and most of the time don't put much effort in talking to me."

"Hey everyone, I (28f) am at my wits end and could use some help. For some background, I was very ill with covid-19 beginning of January 2022. I’m fully vaccinated and also had a very mild case in Aug of 2021. I haven’t felt the same since and I’ve been experiencing brain fog, chest pains, worsened asthma, and anxiety. I was having high heart rates so recently my PCP had me wear a cardiac halter monitor that showed a lot of PVCs and even short runs of ventricular tachycardia. So far the rest of my tests have come back normal and I have an echo coming up. 
 

 I have a history of depression, OCD, PTSD, and anxiety that was very well controlled with an SSRI and therapy. I was even able to taper off my SSRI in 2020 and had been doing well for the first time in my life. 
 

 About a month ago I took a steroid pack for my asthma that sent me into a mental tailspin and worsened the panic attacks I’d been having since covid. I experienced mild psychosis and wasn’t able to function on my own and had to take a LOA from work. My PCP prescribed Klonopin (which I use sparingly) and I’ve improved slightly but I’m still experiencing extreme anxiety and OCD behaviors. Nearly every waking moment I’m plagued with obsessive thoughts about my health and VIVID mental scenarios surrounding my potential death. I cannot drop the thought until I walk myself through the scenario and go through how I would treat myself if I was my patient.
 

 I can not seem to stop checking my heart rate/blood pressure and do it approx 50-100x a day. My medical knowledge tells my rational brain that I’m fine but my anxiety has convinced me that I’m missing something and cannot do anything to save myself from dying. I even find myself googling the simplest medical questions in an attempt to visually convince myself I’m fine. To no avail.
 

 I eventually have to return to work and don’t want to do so because I cannot risk a mistake.
 

 I’ve tried every technique I can think of to ease my anxiety/fear but nothing is working. Living like this is excruciating, it feels like being boiled alive. My thoughts have become darker and I’m afraid I’ll break. Thank you for reading this as I know it was long. ANY advice, positive thoughts, or ideas are welcome. ♥️
 

 TLDR: Paramedic with constant panic attacks, OCD behavior, and fears of death after covid. Needs advice on how to cope."
"My wife and I are 29 years old. We've been married for over 2 years and we love each other very much. She's a public sector employee with a promising career and I'm a substitute teacher who is searching for a full position. We want more than anything to have a house that we own and to have our children together. 
 That being said, I have been in absolute knots of anxiety for a while now. I've been worried off and on for the last year about this, but I am just wracking myself with worry right now about it. 
 We cannot afford a house in our community until I gain a position and I don't know when that will be. 
 She is salaried but I only get paid as much as I work and she's the main breadwinner in our house right now. I have basically zero agency in my job and I just survive day-by-day since I have to sub in all subjects rather than the one's I'm qualified to teach. 
 My wife is also worried about fertility due to her and I being almost 30 and she had an ovary removed due to a complication years ago. I want so so bad to be able to give her a baby and a home but I don't know when or if I even can. The global situation is just making things worse. The housing shortage and inflation, I'm just scared to death that the simple, stupid little life that I want for us is going to be tragically out of reach. I'm in Washington State by the way, if that helps with any potential advice."
Hello guys. I am 26 years old. Never really had any friends. I have really bad social anxiety when i go out with people i am always clumsy and awkward. If something very embarrasseing happened i will feel like shit for the whole week. I can't stop worry about what people think of me no matter how i hard i try. I feel like i have miss many opportunities because of my social anxiety. I never had a girlfriend. Never really had a friend that is a girl and people always find it odd that i am still a virgn. I am getting really lonely and depress. Life kinda suck right now. Sometimes i just wish i was a outgoing extrovert and my life would be so much better.
"Today has been a pretty busy day for me granted I haven't been super active. Just prepping things on my laptop and getting things together for a baby shower. I was feeling burnt out and frazzled by the end of today. Well as I was watching TV, I started to get chest pains. Of course this threw me into a panic and I thought I was having a heart attack and am still fearful. I'm trying to take deep breaths and calm down, but I am so scared. I'm 25 and overweight, I am working on losing it. This is freaking me out and I'm wondering if anyone has any insight?"
"Anyone else's tension headaches include pain in the ears? Like I'm already heavy headed 24/7 and have been for over a month, the dizziness doesn't help. It's so aggravating."
"I'm 27 and I legitimately don't know what other people do with their lives, what goals I'm supposed to have, interests, career possibilities, etc. I don't socialize very much outside work, mostly because I don't know how and I don't know what people are even supposed to talk about or what people even do when they hang out. I have 0 career interests or compulsion to find a better job, but I also know staying at my restaurant job of 4+ years for the rest of my life is not sustainable (minimum wage, 0 benefits, physically exhausting). Pretty sure my relationship of 6+ years is coming to an end (we've been on break for 2 months due to his mental health) and I honestly can't see myself with someone else. And I mean that in more of a logistical way than an emotional way. I have no desire to have kids or start a family or whatever either. 
 

 So what the hell am I supposed to do?"
So i need to take diflucan because i ak not able to use cream of suppositories for a yeast infection down below. I really wish i could just insert the cream but i really cant. Now i have to take this stupid med. I HATE taking meds. I always expect the worst that I will die or get some long lasting damage. It sucks...
"Hello everyone!
 

 Just right now, I made it to school safely without being accompanied by anyone in my car. I don’t drive on the freeway yet but took the city streets to commute to school. Not gonna lie, I was on the verge of having an anxiety attack and in tears but I beat anxiety’s ass and managed to drive myself without anyone being in the car. I never felt so proud of myself and I’m proving even to myself that I can drive by myself. I will update later about tonight’s drive back home!"
"I have experienced sleep paralysis recently for the first time and I’m terrified to sleep. I jump at the smallest sounds while awake, and then like when I go to bed im scared a scary figure will appear like I read in some scary sleep paralysis stories. I’m worried this will be my life, having sleep paralysis. Like I’m frightened all day and then when night comes I wanna cry and force myself to stay away until I pass out. My anxiety makes these occurrences worse. I told my family and they did not even seem worried. I feel so alone."
I might never leave the house again this is going to be so bad for me.
"It prevents me from sleeping early. When I'm at work, I suddenly get hit with a wave of anxiety and fears of something bad happening before I make it home. As I said in the previous line, it really affects my sleep patterns... because I'm scared of something happening. 
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 I think what has made this worse is that I've still been adjusting to a new job, which has brought with a lot of changes and stress + anxiety. Each time before I try to sleep, I check my social media statuses to make sure I didn't leave anything set to ""online""... I check like several times before plugging my phone in for the night. 
 

 

 I'm 24. I went to the doctor months ago and they didn't find anything wrong in the tests, but there's those stories that pop up occasionally of young people who were known to be healthy passing away and it makes my anxiety spike. 
 

 

 How do I get through this?"
"I (28F) have pretty severe anxiety and have for years. I went through a really stressful event a few months ago which made my anxiety skyrocket. I have been suffering from chest pains that come and go but sometimes can last all day. It feels like a deep pain or intense burning on the left side of my chest. I’ve been to numerous doctors appointments and have had ECGs, a heart echo, CBC blood test, and comprehensive metabolic panel. The doctor told me there was nothing wrong with my heart and that she would be shocked if a healthy 28 year old was having a heart attack. I am still convinced that somehow the doctor missed something. When I’m in the midst of intense chest pain, it’s hard to not want to go to the ER, but I can’t afford to go to the ER every time the chest pain happens since it’s so frequent. I would probably be there once a week.
 

 I’m at a point where I’m constantly anxious due to the chest pain which then is probably making the chest pain worse. And sometimes the pain comes up even when I’m not feeling particularly anxious, which then makes me anxious. It’s a never ending cycle.
 

 How can I convince myself that I’m not having a heart attack? Is it dangerous to just ignore chest pain and assume it’s anxiety? Now that I’ve had all the tests I question whether my health has changed since having them, even though they were all last month. Are there any other tests I should request to rule out a health problem? 
 

 Help!"
"26(F) Does anyone else experience the feeling of like your head or brain freaking out when you start panicking? I am not exactly sure how to describe the feeling other than it feels like your brain is screaming and wants to rip itself out…? 
 

 I’m sorry for the gross creepy description but I have no better way of describing it. 
 

 When ever I get this feeling it’s usually an indication of the beginning of my attack. 
 

 That feeling freaks me out even more. 
 

 

 I feel like I’m really struggling with my anxiety today and everything is getting to me. I started having that brain feeling because I was typing my phone number and typed my old number that I hadn’t had in years instead of the one I’ve had for several years…. I feel scared that I’m like losing control of my brain or my memories."

I’m freaking out. I struggle with health anxiety (yes I am apart of the Reddit group but posts get taken down so easy there). From what I can remember I have struggled with constipation for a long time.. but never really paid any mind to it because it was what it was. But as I got older and my health anxiety grew I now panic thinking it’s something sinister. I’m too afraid to see a doctor and I thought I might have IBS but everyone says you have to feel some sort of pain to even be considered for that diagnosis 😭 I’m truly so scared of something more than just constipation. Does anyone struggle with this? 😭

"So I don't really know my brother even though he is 3 years younger. When we were kids I'd maybe say I knew him better but once both hit teenage years and now adult years we have both changed quite alot and I have no clue who and how he is as a person. As kids we frequently fought (physically) in ways that were not nice but we could also be friends I was the one ""hitting harder"" which I feel very bad about now. He seemed to be the more ""affectionate"" of us but I was very rejecting (probably because I was already developing some self esteem and confidence issues). Anyway, we are both in our 20's and due to my anxiety and likely avpd I keep worrying about how he is doing since I don't know him and neither does my dad he says. Not sure about my mom cuz she is one that causes alot of my rumination and anxiety and I don't feel like I really know her either. My dad does say it seems like my brother is more similar to my mom tho.
 

 Anyway, in my dream he was more like his younger self and kept telling me how depressed he is and how he doesn't have anyone to talk to and how I should be there for him. This all while he was threatening to kill himself. 
 

 I guess I'm scared that he goes through the same issues as myself or worse due to our mom's behaviour (she easily gets angry and passive aggressive) but since I don't know him and he is pretty quiet It feels very awkward talking. I do think he is a more ""stable"" person than me as he seems to perhaps worry more about ""realistic"" problems but again I'm not sure. I know he has quite a few friends that hopefully he feels like he could talk to, but this fear of him or one of my parents killing themselves is a very exhausting thought when it first starts to ""spin""."

"So over did it last night drinking. 
 

 Heart rate has been around this range for the past 20 is hours. 
 

 Do I need to be concerned or is this just normal effects of the alcohol leaving my body? 
 

 As don't want to go down to emergency and waste their time if this is to he expected sometimes with alcohol use.
 

 Only reason I ask is never had this before from drinking alcohol. 
 

 Just seems like can't be safe for my heart to be at this level at rest for so long?
 

 Getting the odd heart palpitation every couple of hours as well.
 

 My usual resting is like 50-60."
"So since last year had a bunch of odd heart symptoms for the first time, panic attacks, heart palpitations, rapid heart rate. 
 

 Had numerous tests from cardiologist and they cleared me to exercise months ago. 
 

 Also doing therapy to get over the anxiety. 
 

 Has anyone been through a similar journey and can share how they got back into pushing themselves during exercise? 
 

 Did you slowly increase exercise intensity? 
 

 Did you find some types of cardio better than others? 
 

 I've been weightlifting, but whenever I try to do cardio work and get my heart rate up really high it scares the crap out of me so I stop.
 

 Would love to get back to the point where I don't even think twice about my heart during exercise or rest."
How I am living every day of my life is just studying and going to the lab and gym. I am 26 and still haven't gone to any places. Haven't travelled anywhere (like for a vacation) except going back to my hometown after I became 15. Never visited clubs. Or haven't gone to movies with friends. Or birthday parties. Or drank or smoked. Or haven't even hugged anyone. Is there anyone here who is like me? I am sure there are some people who are experiencing something worse than this. I would feel better if I see there are people like me lol. And if you are like me how do you tell yourself that you can enjoy life even without doing all those things? Some people keep telling me that I am not enjoying my life and I wouldn't be able to do that after getting older. And it makes me feel worse.

"I tried my best and pushed myself out of the comfort zone ...I haven't worked for 3 years and I went to have some temp jobs. Yesterday I finished the job but today I quitted it cuz I almost had panic attack. The job is very simple but they need us to wait in waiting room for 2 hours and during that period, I panicked. I looked at my phone only and couldn't look at anybody else. And then a bunch of loud people joined and I panicked even more. They laughed and shouted and stuff and I felt they were laughing and talking about me. My thoughts went wild and I simply went to the supervisor and said I am unwell and can't do the shift. I felt so guilty and useless now. Yesterday I could do it cuz the people were quieter but today I couldn't deal with loud people. I felt I couldn't function in society anymore. I dunno how can I survive."

"I’ve (26f) been dealing with a lot of anxiety lately. A whole slew of things has brought this on and I’m just wondering if going on medication would help or if I should seek help in something else? 
 

 Things causing the anxiety:
 

 -working a term government job that is set to end in a month and not knowing if I get an extension
 -death of a close family friend over 7 months ago that I still haven’t been able to wrap my head around (yes, I’ve been going to therapy)
 -feeling like I haven’t been effectively budgeting to save but don’t know where my money is going 
 -my bf has been sick and seeing him in pain (autoimmune disease) but not knowing how to help is just a crap feeling
 -lately, just not feeling good enough at anything (cooking, cleaning,etc.)
 

 My anxiety has negatively affected my sleep and I get so snappy at my bf (we live together). I’ve been going to the gym to try to alleviate some of the stress by breaking a sweat. Despite feeling better temporarily, it doesn’t help in the long term. Diet has been pretty healthy as well. 
 

 Just looking for advise if people have seen improvements on the meds and if that’s what I need or if there’s something else I should look into. 🤷🏼‍♀️"

 So there is this guy(25M) I have worked with for a while and I have a hard time figuring him out. He is introverted but well liked by the majority of people.

He is popular with girls and I feel he knows this but he is rather reserved and only talks about superficial stuff nothing too deep. I’m literally the only girl that doesn’t throw herself at him. Another thing is he has a staring problem like he will stare at any female( of any age) and if they catch him he will just continuing staring at them a lot of the times they see this as flirting but idk what it means I just was taught it was creepy to stare at people. Like I don’t why but it makes me uncomfortable when he does this because we will be working together and he just stares and it’s like I’m not even there. I have been rude to him a couple of times because of it but either he doesn’t care or he’s just full of himself. There are some things I like about him but I feel it’s hard to judge someone I don’t really know."
Is it too late y'all? I feel like it'll be much harder now compared to when you were 20.
"I'm 29 years old, I have had a driver's license for 12 years now. I barely drive because I don't have a car. I just graduated with a Ph.D., so I'm getting to the point where I need a car for a job. I do drive once in a while when I'm moving my stuff to a new place, but that's it. Every time I do drive, I would be very focused and stressed (like taking a final exam in school) for the whole duration of driving. 
 

 

 So I'm wondering if there is driving lessons out there for people that already have a license, but just want to get comfortable driving? I hate parallel parking, I suck at it. I hate going on highways, driving 80-90 miles per hour, and changing lanes on bumpy roads."
Hey everyone. I (26m) am diagnosed with Bipolar 1 exacerbated by severe general anxiety. Almost every day I wake up to debilitating and continuous anxiety which is connected to my GI tract. Therefore every morning I wake up and dry heave for anywhere between 30 minutes and an hour. When I explain this to my loved ones they simply do not understand and I can only talk with my therapist and psychiatrists once a month if I'm lucky. I guess this post is for some sort of validation that I need to not feel like i'm lying to everyone around me.

Youe ideal type...like what characteristics or traits do you look for in a bf/gf or husband/wife? It could also be physical appearance too
"I’ve (26f) never been in a relationship in my entire life. I have severe social anxiety and I suffer from panic attacks. I struggle to communicate with people and I just don’t know how to overcome this issue. My friends are living the ‘normal’ life, dating etc. They’re always talking about their relationships and partners, I honestly envy them. I’ve had crushes when I was in school but that’s about it. Now I’m 26 and I’m worried I might end up alone if it continues this way"
"I've dealt with anxiety a majority of my life, I'm 27 right now. I have generalized anxiety and social anxiety. And I also have BPD. For a little more context, I did just recently get out of a rather controlling relationship and I had also been isolating myself for the better half of two years due to depression.
 

 Now my anxiety is the worst it's ever been, it's affecting every part of my life and everything I do. I can't stop overthinking literally every little thing, to the point that I struggle forming sentences and remembering the names of common things. It's extremely frustrating and embarrassing. I can't focus or concentrate on anything anymore. And the worst of it is when I'm right in the middle of saying something to someone and out of nowhere I'll just completely lose track of what I was saying so my brain panics to try to finish my thought but it never makes any sense. It doesn't matter who it is, whether it's my mom or my best friend or a customer at work, it happens so frequently that I've started to dread conversing with other people in general.
 

 Can anyone relate to this? Or does anyone have any suggestions that might help me? I appreciate any and all feedback. Thank you!"
Tomorrow will be my first day driving to work by myself and I am nervous ….
"Hello everyone, I have a job interview Monday and I'm already nervous I'm literally crying right now. I need to get the job so bad and I'm already imagining that I'll mess up the interview. Any tips or advice? The one question I'm dreading the most is the ""tell me about yourself question"""
"While I had my therapy session yesterday which was unwinding a lot of my past trauma, but I couldn't stop crying during my session and in the past two - three days and when I say crying, I mean clenching for a breath crying. I used to be better at dealing with it but something triggered it for me three days ago and it hasn't stopped ever since then. I am having bad headache, I want to only stay in bed and just not to do anything and now also struggling badly with my self esteem. My therapist suggested me some cognitive techniques but I don't seem to be receptive of it as much. I really want to get out of my head and stop feeling this way but I feel lost and overwhelmed. Is there any way to get started? To just make sure I see that little hope in some way? I donot even know where to get started. Every day I hope it will be a new day until I fall in the same loop again. I really want to be able to break out of this loop and I have made a promise to myself that I am allowing only today to wallow as much as I can and get my shit together tomorrow onwards. Major source of my anxiety is feeling like I am all over the place with regards to my schedule. So I would really like to have one and stick to one but apart from that I just want to be able to feel lighter, and have this hypothetical weight lifted off me - which ironically I am not even aware of what it is."

Hey guys.. so I haven’t had a drink in about 3 weeks due to me feeling anxious after I drink alcohol. I really wanna try some wine this weekend coming up but I don’t wanna experience any anxiety. Are there any tips that would help prevent anxiety after drinking alcohol?

I was thinking something around the lines of ""want to hang out again sometime?""

I'm 27 years old and still trying to figure out my life. Right now I work for a Target warehouse making about $22 an hour($700 a week) working 3 12 hour shifts(Sat-Mon). Through them I'm doing online school for free as long as I maintain a 2.0 GPA. I wanted to get my bachelor's in computer science. I live with my father but I'm moving in with mother soon. I had a talk with her and her husband the other day about my plans for myself. They told me that it's too late for college. Saying that I should just become a trucker instead or possible a trade school career option. I've always been swayed by the people around me and I feel like I can't make my own decisions for myself. Are they completely right? Am I just not gonna succeed if I make my own choices for myself?
"25 year old male.

"Hello.
 

 I've been having ongoing symptoms like spikes in resting heart rate to 130, chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath list goes on.
 

 I've been checked heart wise in the form of echo, event monitor, bloods and multiple ECGs all fine. 
 

 So I'm wondering if the problem is my body is constantly pumping out adrenaline when it shouldn't need to. 
 

 I don't know how to describe it, but every 15 minutes I get like 30 seconds of almost tingling feeling, kind of like when something makes you jump. 
 

 Then for about a day after I have one of these episodes where my heart rate goes crazy, my body almost feels stuck tingling all over in constant fight or flight mode. 
 

 Does this sound like anxiety triggering my body to over produce adrenaline? 
 

 Is there anyway to get a handle on this other than starting medication SSRIs? 
 

 I'm starting CBT next week."
"I [25M] dated a girl about a month ago, she was interested in me since a long time and she also approached me. Everything was going fine until some days ago. I always was a socially anxious and awkward person since childhood but I changed myself, especially this year I built a new version of me. Ok so basically the problem started like this: I got busy with exams, and i've been under some pressures lately, and all this caused me a fall back to the old me, the socially awkward person. Me and this girl were in multiple short conversations and i said and did some weird things which i noticed that her facial expressions changed those moments, i also got the vibes of getting shocked because of my awkwardness. Now it's been almost a week and she's been cold to me ever since. What should I tell her to fix this mess that I caused lately? 
 I appreciate your comments!
 

 

 

 Edit: Don't overthink fellas! I solved it. Didn't apologized but mentioned and it solved"

"I just wanted to share my experience (27f) with driving school after finally earning my license through the subsequent instruction and test. I hope I can give some perspective to those who may be interested in such! (It's a bit long but I've been on this sub for a bit so I hope to just connect with anyone feeling like I did!)
 

 For reference, I live in the US southwest. My state has several options for driving schools around the valley, where you can earn your permit and/or license. They all cost around the same, unfortunately, it's not the most affordable investment; If you have a permit and wish to work towards the license it will run about $650ish (I looked at about 3 different schools, all are around this price range). It was 10 total hours of driving, broken into four 2.5 hour sessions, with the fourth consisting of the road test. 
 

 A little about myself as a driver: I've had 4 permits over the course of my driving history, but had never taken the road test until today. I had a lot of procrastination and took advantage of loving friends and family that didn't mind driving my ass around. As I got older, it began to weigh on me heavily and anxiety developed- having to rely on others constantly to do anything, go to and from my job, run errands, go meet up with friends etc. It's no mystery that the US has a significant car culture, everything is spread out and even more so in the southwest. Uber and lyft have been a godsend but it is pricy to use it consistently. All this has made me feel like shit, and I'm sure many here can relate to feeling like less of a person just for not being able to drive (like there is something wrong with you, ""you don't drive, why!?! D:"" that crap). Having moved into my boyfriend's motivated me to push through my moderate anxiety. At this point in my life, I truly felt like it was too late for me to learn and be a capable driver. The investment to pay for driving school was and has been worth it.
 

 My first lesson was two weeks ago at 8am. My first instructor drove with me for 3/4 lessons. There was little to no traffic, and it was a very pleasant drive. I had a lot of anxiety before getting into the car, but once I was on the road I felt pretty good. My instructor was encouraging and made me feel capable and in control. When I made a mistake she was calm and would let me know what I could do to improve, while reminding me of my strengths as a driver.
 

 For my second lesson, I had a different instructor. She was friendly but she made me feel a bit anxious. We drove at 12pm and there was some traffic; we practiced parallel parking in an empty parking lot and I did ok. I still feel I need to work on that. 
 

 By my third lesson I felt fairly confident and in a way, used to driving. I found myself spacing out a bit, which was something I wondered about driving: will I ever reach the point where driving becomes natural and I'm not in a constant state of panic and alertness? Well, I'll tell you it's possible! It was a pleasant and relaxing drive. I felt in control and aware but I also felt like I didn't need to forever be in""oh god I'm driving!"" mode. I think that's a big hurdle for driving anxiety- finding that balance where you trust yourself to be in control and aware but also realize that driving can become natural. 
 

 Today was my last lesson, and I felt confident in my ability (finally)! We started the drive with the road test, which consisted of driving about 15 minutes to a neighborhood with four-way stops. It ended with a three-point turn in the DMV parking lot, where I passed the test and we both went into the DMV to get my license! I still had time left for my session so we drove on the freeway; I was actually super nervous getting on but I feel a lot better driving on the highways after the short practice. The 55-60 speed limit is a bit reliving once you're on it because it doesn't feel as fast as you might think, and if you don't want to go any faster just stay to the right!
 

  I know that most of my anxiety comes from dread before I even get into the car, but I have to push through that to know that I'm a capable and safe driver. My instructor was a big part of my success; having someone who is confident in your ability to learn and grow through your anxiety is important. I still have some anxiety about driving, but it is significantly less than before I did the course. Driving time in the car was the most important part, the longer you drive the more you get used to the feeling. 
 

 **TLDR** My driving school experience gave me the knowledge and confidence to be a driver. Before, I felt like it was too late for me to learn, but now I feel like I can get on the road and get to my destinations safely with minimal anxiety. If you have the financial means I say go for it, I am so happy and relieved to be free of this restraint.

 Now to buy a car in this market...shit."
"So I [29F] have a person that I dated very briefly [33M] and when things didn't work out we chose to remain FWB. We were both ok with the arrangement but about 2 weeks ago, he stopped talking to me suddenly because he was having mental health issues due to some family situations. I understand and I know his relationship with his family is a bit strained at best. I've haven't received even a text message in over a week and my anxiety is spiraling out of control because part of me is stressed out thinking something is wrong and part of me is anxious that he is using this as an excuse to ghost. I haven't been able to redirect my thoughts successfully and it's causing me a lot of continuous anxiety."
"As an INFJ, something that comforts me. Is knowing the facts. Knowing how something works. Knowing what is causing the problem. 
 I am 26 and my earliest panic attack that i can remember was when i was 5. It has only spiraled from there. I have had anxiety ruin my life. But ive also been able to work through it from a different approach. So i come here today to offer some insight on how anxiety works. What it is. And how perhaps this thought process could help.
 Anxiety in its raw form. Is energy. Panic is energy. Energy can not be created nor destroyed, merely transferred. So if you are able to harness this energy, and use it else where. You wont have time for panic. This is why they recommend exercise. Anywho, when you have this energy inside of you that you cant release, it seeps out in the way that it knows can expend alot of energy in a short amount of time. Panic/Anxiety attacks.
 I liken this process to filling up a bucket. I call it, the cortisol bucket.
 we have this bucket, this threshold with which we hold our cortisol. The hormone that causes stress. With every small stress we experience, it adds more to this bucket. Some people have small buckets, some people have swimming pools. Either way, as this bucket fills. It gets harder and harder to deal with the stress of life. You can feel it creeping up on you with every hard problem. Until one day, your cup runneth over and all of a sudden youre panicking? But how could that be? I didnt have any specific trigger. You dont need one. Your body decided “bucket full must empty”. This is again why exercise is reccomended because it offloads this stress hormone. 
 Now if you have a panic disorder, you offload this energy through mental fears because the body knows “hey, i can get rid of this fast lets panic.”
 For some people this causes the alarm for survival mode which will get stuck for a while until the threat is gone. For me its about 2-4 weeks of survival mode and im back to living life. If you have time, try to dig into the parasympathetic nervous system. It will truly open your eyes. 
 But i provide this perspective because it has me looking at anxiety as a biological process instead of a mental one. Because even though it is a mental illness, it does so much to our bodies. And its not just all in our heads. Its real and deserves to be treated as such."
"After my mental health crash in 2019 (was bad before but this is where it reached a level where it started to feel crippling) I haven't managed to clean properly. Like I can manage a few surfaces every now and then but it may take an entire day. It affects my boyfriend and I really want to and try to get better but I don't know how to get rid of the overwhelming feeling and how to just push through. I think some of it roots in the fear of being the one who always clean (since I'm the woman) since that's a very big fear rooting in my own upbringing and because he is an only child with a mom that does everything in terms of chores and this showed more clearly in the beginning when we moved together but he has changed alot and now I am the bad one.
 

 I suffer from anxiety, depression and avpd (which is probably the worst of them as it activates the other)"
"Dating sucks man. I wanna date but at the same time my inner self is like ""No you're a loser. She'll never go out with a loser"" 😣"
"I got my social anxiety quite arly at school because everyone would mock me.
 Fast forward, I am 29 right now and am able to get through social situations much more easily and people do not treat me too bad in comparison to my old days, but I still feel very disrespected and feel more at ease when I am alone, although I do get lonely often.
 But when I am with people I feel kinds tense, I watch them communicate with ease and for me, I do have a honest conversatiin sometimes but I do not like crossing personal boundaries moreover when someone crosses mine.
 By the way I really feel ignored by people I would want to talk to, it is like a curse hanging above my head for everyone to see, I keep thinking maybe there is something highly unlikeable about me, my face maybe, my maners or the size of my body (I am quite tall), the only people I keep talking to are my colleagues, but among them I do not feel like they are my people, like we can realate, even if they persistently talk to me...
 I do not want to give up as I did many times before.
 My plan is just to get into something I am good at and get acknowledged, but I do not like being a part of a team because I feel like it makes me weak, for normal people it may provide a sense of safety, unity, a sense of being looked over, but for me it feels like a constant threat, because I often get criticizm, instructions and what not and that upsets me, it is quite hard to concentrate while working in teams to be honest, while I must admit I excel at many things when I am alone.
 It is like everyone likes to dominate me for my soft character, because I show everyone my weakness but not my strengths, people like to use me quite often and I am unhappy about it and do not even know how to react in defence without appearing to be insane."
"Has anyone just felt really awkward at every new work position ever? I’m [27F] new and feel like there’s always a week where I do really well socially but it depends if I’m with coworkers I am comfortable around, but after the weekend rolls around suddenly I am very awkward/shy/overthinking the next week. Feels like a constant vicious cycle. The other day I froze up when I got asked a question that I did not know the answer to and my mind blanked. Or sometimes I never know how to insert myself into work conversations or hang outs. It just feels so dreadful but I don’t wanna see antisocial either."
"Idk exactly how to put all this in words but I (28F) go through cycles where I’m in a social setting and start to get overwhelmed and in my head just by too much going on (like too many conversations at once, esp if I’m with especially extroverted people). I then start to feel like I’m acting really awkward and kind of out of tune with conversations around me. and saying awkward things just bc I’m so in my head and feeling uncomfortable. 
 

 Then later I replay everything in my head and just feel so ashamed and embarrassed about the way I acted, like I just can’t seem to fit in. 
 

 This sort of episode happens to me on a regular basis and it feels terrible, and I just am looking for a way to somehow break any part of this cycle. 
 

 On another note, I’m dating and would like to find a partner, but I can’t imagine showing anyone this side of myself that Im dating. I can’t imagine someone that I’m dating seeing this side of me, where I’m shutting down in a social setting and then spiraling about it afterwords, and being ok with dating someone like this. 
 

 Just looking for thoughts/perspectives or advice on any of this"

"Been feeling anxious from a variety of things and seemingly everything lately. Includes:

 2. my roommate again because he is really the major source right now. 
 3. my family
 4. taking on too many things (ft work, a class for real estate, being active, stock market, etc)

"Hey yall. I was prescribed phentermine to help me in my weight loss journey (I'm 25F). I've been on it for a week and the past two days I've noticed a lot of mood swings, anxiety, and irritableness. I feel like I want to punch a wall, I can't keep still, and my anxiety is through the roof. 
 

 I'll call my doctor tomorrow but there's not much I can do about it right now. My normal coping skills aren't working and I am so restless/on edge I can't eat. 
 

 I tried working out and even a hard-core strength and cardio workout didn't help my tension (which it usually does). I also can't do that every day to relieve this. 
 

 Anyone else experience this? It's been working and I've definitely lost a pound or two but the side effects aren't worth it.

"I currently can’t afford therapy. I am suffering on the daily. There is one place I can go to that should be covered by my insurance but I haven’t had time to get there yet because of work.
 

 I have been diagnosed by past psychiatrists with PTSD, anxiety, depression, OCD, &amp; add. 
 

 I am 28 (F) still living at home with my parents. I can’t afford to move out yet, but also don’t even really want to.  
 

 An old coworker and friend of mine, who happens to be immensely handsome, and seemingly kind, has expressed the desire to want to spend more time with me. 
 

 He lives across the country, and has paid for half of my travel costs to come spend a week with him this august. (I’ll be away from home for 2 weeks with travel.) He’s got an itinerary, and everything. It’s adorable. And sounds like it could be really fun. But I feel like I can’t enjoy it to the fullest because of my anxiety. 
 

 He could come here, and has expressed desire to do that in the future. But I don’t see the point in him coming here first because eventually he’ll want me to go out there too. 
 

 I have not told my dad yet, because he’s very sensitive. I know he’s going to be worried sick, which makes me feel immensely sad and guilty. and I know I’m going to miss him. My dad is diabetic and I have terrible anxiety about his health. But we’re also very close. This is extremely out of my comfort zone. I’ve never been farther than 6 hours away from my parents. I mention my dad the most because as much as I love my mom, she’s an alcoholic so I’m closer to my dad. 
 

 I’m terrified something will happen to one of us while I’m away. I can’t be without my dad. Or my mom, really. But especially my dad. 
 

 I have been very ill the last few days and was taking an antibiotic I’ve never taken before. I spiraled into a panic attack last night and had to switch to a different antibiotic today. What caused me to spiral was the one antibiotics but also thinking about this whole thing. I’ve been tearing up over it for days, but last night when I wanted to cry the most I somehow couldn’t. Idk if it’s the meds, or something else. 
 

 I’m sure this seems dramatic, but I know I need help. 
 

 I should also mention I have a cat at home that I have horrific separation anxiety from, and I feel incredibly guilty leaving him for vacations because I know he gets upset when I leave. He’s very attached to me. I can’t bring him with me because I am taking the train. And also that would just be cruel, uprooting him from the comfort of my home for my own selfish reasons. 
 

 I don’t know what to do."

It’s almost like imposter syndrome; eventually he will find out I’ve tricked him into loving me? Idk.

"I've been feeling sick for a long time now but as someone with health anxiety its really difficult to tell when it's something that warrants medical attention. I still don't know if there's actually anything wrong. I've felt sick in the past, seen a doctor, and had all results come back fine multiple times before but I'm hoping this time will be different for multiple reasons. One, I have some more clear signs of something not working right in my body and two even if they don't find anything I'm hoping maybe they'll prescribe something for my anxiety so I can at least get that in check. Going to the doctors office makes me really anxious unfortunately but at least I'm finally doing something about how I've been feeling. I've spent so much time ""waiting"". Waiting to feel better, waiting to feel worse. Everything has been put on hold. I'm hoping this will be my first step in getting my life back."
"Me (22AFAB) and my bf (25M) have been together for about 2.5 years (we broke up once for 4 months and have been back together now for about a year and some change). Since I have dated him I have had very bad relationship anxiety. Our “first” relationship wasn’t unhealthy but it wasnt great? He wasn’t affectionate at all really (I had my issues too) however I was his first partner EVER. We broke up because we just weren’t compatible but got back together. Since then he has been sooo much better however, I still feel bad relationship anxiety. I still feel he is not as affectionate and romantic. Now, for background info, I am extremely affectionate and romantic. I have been in relationships before with toxic people and have been love bombed intensely. I’m used to highs and lows, but with him it’s healthy and steady, however a bit boring. Now, he definitely isn’t NOT affectionate, we cuddle and he tells me he loves me but I feel there is some passion or romance lacking? But I feel as though this is just cause we’ve been together for awhile and I am used to unhealthy relationships. I’m constantly thinking about the grass being greener and how I want him to show more affection and love. This has been and issue with us for awhile but I can see he is trying. Another thing is that I am also more outgoing and passionate about things and he is more so quiet and reserved and a homebody. I feel like that has a play in it but i don’t know. He is a very kind person and no one has ever treated me so well. We both have issues opening up and being vulnerable and I think that also makes me feel less connected to him. I see a therapist and he just started seeing one too and I am fairly certain most of this is just relationship anxiety, but I still find myself thinking the grass may be greener and that we are incompatible? I have no idea. How do you know if it’s just overthinking or genuine incompatibility?"
"Hello! I have been dealing with really stressful situations, and severe health anxiety for the past year. I had palpitations, breathless feeling, chest pressure..you name it .. I have been getting better but.. now I somehow feel like I'm way too aware of my teeth? Sometimes I get that feeling you get when someone scratches a knife on a plate, or nails on a blackboard.. but it's like, I feel I wanna smash my teeth really hard. I know I'm focusing way too much on it, and that's the anxiety kicking in, but I am really scared I could be developing something way worse than health anxiety? Anyone?
 Help"
"This isn’t the first time it has happened, but I think it’s considered sleep paralysis? Idk. I feel like I’m awake mentally but I cannot move my body, like I’m paralyzed. It’s truly scary and I just want to know if anyone else with anxiety has it :("

"Hey everyone, I (27m) have been taking effexor for a couple of years due to anxiety and depression. It has given me my life back and I am on 75mg. 
 

 Recently I have become sexually active, But can’t shake this feeling that effexor impacts my performance. 
 

 I have only had sex with her about 6 times. I get an erection, can orgasm, sometimes multiple times. But when we change positions I sometimes lose my erection, I worry about it during the act as well. 
 

 When I masturbate, I have no trouble keeping my erection for 30+ minutes.
 I have also cum twice with her and could get hard after.
 

 Do you think it is because of meds that I lose my erection or more psychological?
 

 Would love some advice and opinions on this. Thank you!"
"I am 28 years old. And I just ordered pizza on the phone for the very first time. This feels absolutely invigorating. I have such a big adrenaline rush it's ridiculous. 
 I absolutely abhor speaking on the phone, especially when it's for any type of order that I need to remember. 
 BUT I DID IT."

My grandmother talked me into going to the Juneteenth parade. I usually like to stay at home but I actually enjoyed myself. We even went to the festival afterward.
"I have had a high fever (it’s slightly better atm) since last Tuesday. I called in sick on Wednesday morning but my manager was not too happy about it since we are short staffed so he would struggle finding someone to cover my shift.
 

 I have already called in sick twice in a row. 
 I went to work on Friday even though I felt sick. The only reason I didn’t call in sick that day was to show them that I was really sick so maybe they would understand if I was to take another day off. I almost threw up twice and my colleague could see how sick I was so he asked the manager to let me go home, which he agreed to.
 

 I’m kinda scared to call in sick tomorrow (Monday) as I don’t know if my manager will be okay with it. I’m still not well enough to go to work
 

 I don’t know what to do"

"Is it just me or does anyone get anxiety before drinking alcohol. But once you drink, if you finally convince yourself to do it, you're fine. Then the hangover brings major anxiety so you again decide not to drink for a long period of time. I hate this. Sometimes I just want to enjoy one drink but I can't cause I'll constantly fear the hangover and so I'll talk myself out of drinking."
"Had an anxiety attack today, I've calmed down more but just want to vent a little.
 

 Basically an old co-worker reached out to me on Facebook today and wanted to meet up and catch up. She applied for a job I previously had and didn't get it and she wanted me to visit her home even. She ended up blocking me over a joke. We were just talking about old co-workers and joking around and the following is when it went downhill.
 

 Me: Just double checking, you're not gonna ask me to join an MLM right? 😂
 

 Her: Sorry what?!
 

 Me: It's a meme/joke often times when someone reaches out from the past usually it's something along the lines of asking if they want to join a ""business opportunity"" aka MLM
 

 Her: How offensive!! And a little too judgemental! RUDE!
 

 Me: I was kidding! Haha it's an internet joke
 

 

 From here I was blocked.
 

 I still had her personal number on my phone so I texted her, ""I just wanted to apologize for the joke. I didn't mean to be rude or offensive. "" and left her a voice message along the same lines too. 
 

 I have never been blocked by someone before and had an anxiety attack over upsetting someone not on purpose. 
 

 I feel a lot better now but still feel like crying and apologizing to her. Looking back I don't think I did anything wrong? 
 

 Yet still feel bad for upsetting them.
 I wish I didn't give a shit what she thought, why do I care so much? I literally haven't seen this lady in 6+ years."
"Not sure I know how to explain this. But basically sometimes my arms and hands feel like they're moving in slow mo or like my fingers will feel really heavy when doing something as simple as typing. 
 

 Is this an anxiety thing? Any good tips to stop this happening?
 

 Seems to come in waves sometimes with head rush."
"So I’ve been sick with high fever since last Tuesday. I’m feeling slightly better but not fit enough to go back to work atleast this week. I called in sick (3rd time) today (Monday). I’ve spoken to my doctor and they gave me a sick note lasting till the end of the week. But how do I tell my manager that I have a sick note and I won’t be coming to work for the rest of this week?
 

 I’ve never been this sick before and I’ve never had to get a sick note, so I’m just nervous about how my manager might react. Plus I’ve only been working there for nearly 3 months so I don’t want to risk losing my job."
I’m a 25 (F) and I would say I’m introverted with a touch of social anxiety I believe you can be both. Anyways I’ve always thought I should seek out more extroverted people you know opposites attract however I notice I’m liking people more on the introverted side. However this particular person is hard to figure out. He’s outgoing but quiet at the same time and seems selective on who he befriends. Sometimes I can’t him staring and or smiling at me but when I try to approach he stops smiling but when I look away he goes back to smiling. I know it’s a weird thing to focus on but I’m not sure how to approach someone like this because I’m also seem unapproachable or shy. When we do talk it’s not much and it’s blah but the staring and smiling through me off a little.
"I’ve had health anxiety on and off for the better part of 10 years now. I’m 27m and healthy, never really had any issues and I STILL have worried about every illness under the sun. It’s so debilitating when I get into my spirals that I can barely function for a few weeks at a time to get myself back on track. I’m in the middle of one now and honestly I’m just exhausted, drained and over everything. 
 

 I’ve had these pressure tension headaches for the past week in my temples and forehead from stress - they’re subsiding but this morning I bend over to tie my shoes and I felt this pressure in my face and behind my eyes like blood rushing. It triggered me AGAIN and I’m spiralling all over again :(. I’m just deathly afraid of brain tumours and can’t stop panicking over it. 
 

 Just need some support I guess."
"Hello I've been noticing that when I scratch mosquito bites on my back, I get like a rash around it. Lots of red spots. Tried scratching just for the sake of it, without mosquito bite involved, and the spots appeared instantly. Also, the other day I carried a bag over my shoulder and these spots, or rash, appeared on it. 
 I'm scared it could be a sign of leukemia or blood clots... 
 

 But could it be just delicate skin? I'm really pale, and this happens mostly where I never get sunlight on. 
 Maybe I have an iron deficiency or something, cause of poor diet? I'm terrified."
"Every morning I get up for work lately I've been noticing two things
 1). I wake up like an hour or so before my alarm
 2). My heart is racing (i think this is the cortisol awakening response) and it takes a while before it calms back down
 

 Is this normal? Is there anything I can do about it?"
"It feels like I’m weird even compared to others with social anxiety. I literally don’t understand how so many people here mention things like friends, even if it’s just one close friend. It seems impossible to make friends when you have SA, because I get too anxious to think of anything funny or interesting, so I always end up being the most boring person in the room. Doesn’t matter what I do or where I go, I’m always just there in the background, unable to talk to anyone. Can anyone else relate?"
"So long story short, I have some moles that I am worried about. I’m in the military and had my doc look them over and he even thinks they are okay but I asked for a referral to a derm so I could be sure… but that was in September.. I still haven’t gone. I am so scared to go and them find something bad, but I’m also scared of not knowing and living in fear forever. Has anyone here had this experience and could maybe share how they got over their fear of going? 🥺 my uncle on my moms side had melanoma, but he was the only one. He had it removed and is fine to this day."

"I (M26) have really intense general and social anxiety. I’ve recently had a bit of a quarter life crisis where I’ve realized I’m not the person I want to be, and that I’ve let my anxiety prevent me from living a fulfilling life. I’ve struggled with alcoholism due to how I feel, and while I’m on the road to recovery, I just feel like I’m hopeless. I have an incredible support network but I just don’t take opportunities or grow.
 My anxiety has held me back from so much, and I want to take my life in my own hands, as I’m just existing at the moment and it feels awful.
 

 I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience, or any advice/strategies that could help with putting myself out there and challenging myself."
"As the title says I can't seem to get over literally the worst panic attack I've ever had. Up until then I've had about 3. The first one was related to tooth pain, second was not wanting to go to work and be bullied, 3rd was when I had heart palpitations about once every hour one night. I'm 28M at the time of this one, I've been having some chest pain occasionally but nothing out of the ordinary for me, I also started smoking delta 8 2 months before. Smoking was really helping with my A.D.D. so I liked to wake up and smoke a little on my days off. I came upstairs and was about to get ready to help my gf take my room mate to work when suddenly I felt awful, my heart started racing and I felt like I was about to die. I asked her to call me EMS to which she did but I still proceeded to suffer for 20 mins. Wave after wave of constant fear and thoughts of oh God this is it. My heart rate went up to what she counted 230bpm then suddenly it stopped. The worry went higher than I thought it could. I was for sure convinced that was it. About 4 secs later it starts again with a weak 5bpm then climbed back up to 80. Afterwords I went into shock. My vision was going, I couldn't hear anything, I was so cold. EMS finally came and checked me out and said I seemed fine but advised I went with them. I get to the hospital and they say I look fine and everything came back clean. They did recommend I go to a cardiologist but I don't have money or insurance so I never went. Still I can't seem to get over the feeling that something is wrong with me. I have PTSD as a result seeing as it was the scariest moment of my life. I do have high blood pressure and it spikes pretty often and causes me to have another anxiety attack. Before I only had 3. After the incident I've had 7 more. How can I stop being so hung up on it? The anxiety of having another anxiety attack is ruining my life."
"I(26M) am an international student who is on a vacation. I have been here in my country with my parents for more than a month. I felt great spending every day with them. I will be going back to US in a week. I am feeling too nostalgic and down every day. I don't have any social life there. Thinking that I have to go back to living the same life again makes me feel down. I can't avoid thinking that I have to leave my parents and stay there again. 
 [Just so you know, my parents can't stay with me for the next 2-3 years because I can't afford for their accommodation. I am still a student. Haven't started earning yet.]"
"This happened last Thursday, and I'm posting this because I am certain a scenario like this will occur again. 
 

 I'm 25 and recently moved into an apartment complex almost 2 months ago now. This is my first time moving out of the house permanently. About a month ago a girl moved in next door to me from out of state. She is definitely attractive, at least to me in some ways. I introduced myself to her and her parents when I saw them in the hallway. Because I work a swing shift, I don't see her much at all. 
 

 Last Thursday was only the second or third time she saw me. I had left work early that day and got home around 7, when coincidentally she had just gotten back from the grocery store. We had a longer conversation here, about 10 minutes. But the type of conversation we had, while platonic, clearly demonstrated to me that she wanted something more than a platonic neighbor relationship. She offered her number, which makes sense since we're neighbors. She suggested we hang out and try the local cafes/restaurants. And because I had only come down to tame out the garbage and get dinner myself, I had to go. However, she asked what I was doing ""right now"" and asked if I was going back upstairs. 
 

 Either I was completely oblivious to what she was asking, I.e, naive, or just nervous. Most guys would say they aren't doing anything and lead the way back up. I felt the need to eject from the conversation. To be fair, I didn't sleep well that night and was running on only a couple hours of sleep. Still, I wonder why I didn't go back up with her to hang out. 
 

 Now let me get to the crux of my problem which is where the anxiety stems from. I am a virgin. I can guarantee you she is not from what I know. This experience imbalance weighs heavily on me, although I recognize as I get older it will only widen. ~~To avoid getting graphic, ~~let's just say that anything related to sex is not something I know how to do properly, because I've never done it. All I know is what I've seen in porn, which I used to watch nightly until I moved out. Like grooming for example, it's the same way it's always been for me there, which is to leave it alone. Yet I understand that by leaving that as is, you could be inviting problems that can harm your health. How am I supposed to know this at a moment's notice? Women will assume I at least have some experience with intimacy."
"Hello,
 im 29M living in Berlin.
 The only thing that will get me out of my apartment, is that I have to work.
 Except for that, the idea to leave and enjoy my free day gives me so much stress that I can’t do it.
 I’d love to go outside but I’m too scared of it. The stress that it causes me would not make it worth wile. At least that’s what I keep telling myself.
 

 I work Shifts and also on weekends so I will have free days under the week where no one that I know will have time.
 My fiancee is working, when I have time off, a lot of the time.
 But also I want to manage it without her. Sure that helps to get me outside but my heart will then still be racing.
 

 Do you have any suggestions or do you maybe feel the same way and also have to battle against this feeling?"
"In advanced, sorry for my english, im in a hurry a bit en and from Europe (I speak english fairly well, I just dont know proper terms for all the driving related words).
 

 Unlike my peers, I have never had some special wish to glet my drivings licence. I was never, per say, scared of it, I just didnt think about it too much.
 

 I am 25 now, and for my graduation present, my parents payed for my driving lessions. Im from Europe, so I had to first pass therotical driving test (which I got 100% on, and its pretty rare) and also my first aid test wich I also nailed. 
 

 When I started my actual driving lessions, I told my driving instructor about my somewhat fears of driving (for example, that I was scared I could hit someone and things like that). As the time progressed, I could see that my inatructor was pretty bad. He would yell at me, sometimes be on his phone and not paying enough attentions and overall not what I needed. Mind you, I did think about changing my instrustor, but my anxiety got the best of me-I usually hate complaining and push thru with what I get instead of being vocal about it.
 

 Every single time before my driving lessions I could not sleep, I would get anxious, and sometimes even have panic attacks. A few days before my actual driving test, I was so anxious I could not sleep or eat, and even lost a few pounds as a result. 
 

 Anyway, I did pass my exam, and not did I pass it from my first try (which is veeeryy rare, it usually takes people 2-3 tries before they pass because of the corruption, I can elaborate further if anyone is interested) but I also passed it with only one minor error. I was happy I passed, but only because that meant I wouldnt need to see my instructor ever again.
 

 That was like a week ago. I have an older model of car, totally different than one I was used to driving in a driving school. I got the hang of it but I am so scared of driving. Not because im scared I will hit someone, because I drive pretty slow lol. Im scared because, mostly, I feel like I dont really want to drive, and secondly because it feels so illegal for me to just go on the road after just 35hours on road at driving school. I feel pressured to drive because at the end of the day, my parents did pay for it, and also I will need it for a job.
 

 I cant imagine driving alone rn, so I do take my friends when I do, but they are all pretty busy so I only drow a couple of times since I got my licence. I also dont feel comfortable driving on busy roads, but even if I do take a road thats not busy, even a few cars on the road give me massive anxiety...
 

 Will these feelings ever go away? Im currently crying and feeling sick becauss I feel obligated to drive a bit today but I dont ever wanna sit in a car again... Can anyone give me advice?"
"Some things to know about me. I have OCD and I've been diagnosed most of my life with it. I'm 29m and I live with my wife and our two dogs. I am certified to be a teacher and I just got my first signed position. My wife and I want to try for a baby and get a mortgage. My position is located 45 minutes away, there are carpooling options but that is a bit of a commute. My ultimate goal is to get a job in the local district in our town, and idk how long that will take. One of the things with OCD is that it is an intolerance of uncertainty and doubt, it's like you're allergic to those things. What you are supposed to do is sit with the discomfort and anxiety until it eventually goes down on its own. There's just so much going on right now, I'm taking my first steps in my career, wife and I want baby and house, I don't know how I'll cope with my first year of teaching and all the stress that comes with that along with a long commute. My mom has urged me to seek therapy, I did see an OCD specialist located 2 hours away about 7 years ago for a year, but I obviously won't have the time for that and he doesn't take insurance. I saw a local therapist a year ago when my wife had to leave town for 9 weeks to help her mother receive cancer treatment and they recommended that I go with a specialist rather than a talk therapist but my options are limited where I live. Any advice helps."
"I (26f) am very anxious about driving. my family is pressuring me to start and I know I should to make my own life easier but when I got behind the wheel a few weeks ago I was told it's 'normal"" not to see all the parameters and stuff and I'm like...? sorry? I have to guess where the curb is? ""you get used to that "" to BEING CLUELESS ABOUT WHERE I AM ON THE ROAD? any tips? lol. I want to buy a motor bike but no one seems to agree"
I spent almost the whole night in a state of panic and continued to get random hot flashes every time I had a scary thought. It was awful and made it so hard to sleep :(. I’ve been so wound up for 2 weeks now and struggling to calm down. Are regular hot flashes normal with anxiety?
Hey everyone. I have terrible health anxiety and have been going through a very rough time the last two weeks. Last night I noticed when I was in bed and panicking I had this burning sensation on my face and skin/arms. I still have it a bit today and it’s mainly when I lay down. I’m so anxious and just wondering if anyone can give some assurance/has experienced something similar.
"Why is it that every time I eat or drink something my stomach hurts for hours afterwards? Sometimes I even get nauseous, even if I just drank only half a cup of tea.
 This has happened before a few times, I think it's happened last year too, and never threw up. It's not excruciating pain, either, just very uncomfortable, and my breath is awful. How can I know it's not something dangerous? I can't go to the doctor for now. Anyone else went through this? I can't eat"
"I get migraines on a regular enough basis. They can be really unpleasant; making me feel nauseous, off balance, sensitive to lights/noises, increase my anxiety, and are just all around painful. I bring this up because I've been prescribed an antidepressant and I'd like to give it a shot to see if it helps with my anxiety. I also wonder if it might improve my migraines. The issue is I currently take sumatriptan to alleviate my migraine pain when it gets really bad and it's not advised to take an SSRI with a triptan because there's a slight chance you might end up with serotonin syndrome. I don't know the likelihood, it sounds pretty rare but my doctor has suggested a different pain medication for me to take instead called Fioricet.
 

 Of course, that brings up other concerns for me. Firstly, idk if that'll even work for me and when I take meds for my migraines its because I really need them, otherwise I try to just deal with it. The other issue is that, from what I've read, Fioricet is for tension headaches. Now I don't know if I have tension headaches. Sometimes it feels like that might be the case, other times it feels more like a classic migraine. Fioricet also contains caffeine and a barbiturate which I don't know how I feel about that. Barbiturates can be addicting. I don't think I take migraine meds enough for it to be addicting but I have had bad weeks where I have to take something 3 out of the 7 days(with some days in between), sometimes even having to take something two days in a row. 
 

 I feel like I should add that I've seen a neurologist and they prescribed me an SNRI (that I didn't end up taking) with the sumatriptan before so it makes me wonder. I've also read that the SSRIs/SNRIs and triptans have been taken together by people before with no issues but I can see why my other doctor would rather play it safe.
 

 Do ya'll have any experience with this? Did the SSRI help with your migraines at all? Have you taken Fioricet before?"
"I (29m) have been diagnosed with OCD since I was 11, I am going through a major life transition and there are lots of changes, unknowns and uncertainties. My anxiety is so high I can barely sleep and I'm having panicked feelings and sweating constantly. My wife and parents have urged me to find a therapist to talk with and I think they are correct. With our insurance and income levels, I think that I need to either find someone locally or online. I don't live in a major city, I live in a small town of 22k people. I know talk therapy doesn't help a ton for people with OCD, I saw a specialist 2 hours away, for almost a year, 7 years ago but he doesn't take insurance and we can't afford the money or the time that it would take to see him. I am open to tele-therapy through Zoom and I'm looking at NOCD, I just need any other recommendations you all may have for teletherapy or what to look for in a therapist who is not an OCD specialist."
Growing up I always had crushes on guys which seems harmless the only thing is I tend to hyper fixate on one guy. All throughout grad school and I have had bad social anxiety. I also never had a boyfriend and I’m 25(F). I am terrified of rejection and I find reasons why I can’t approach guys. I always think there are girls out there that are more suited for relationships than I am. However I cannot let go of my fixation. I don’t want to live a life of what ifs. I actually want to do something and approach the guy I fancy or any guy as practice I can’t let social anxiety ruin my life.
"Hello! Today I was sleeping, and in my dream I was struggling to breathe properly, felt as if there was something in my throat. Turns out it was real. I woke up and I felt something, some lump or whatever. Breathing felt weird, and drinking water too.. not sure if it's an infection, or if there could be a tumor somewhere in there.
 It doesn't hurt at all, just feels really uncomfortable"
"I (26F) have suffered with anxiety as early as 5 years old. I was officially diagnosed when I was about 11-13. I’ve had full blown attacks, small attacks, attacks I could easily ignore, and attacks that put me in the hospital.
 

 Well, one day they just… stopped. And I was really my best self. I had a “GNF” attitude and it was great. 
 

 Well, it came back, seemingly with a vengeance. 
 I had about 5ish years of peace. I still had anxiety, just no attacks of any kind. 
 

 Now, my heart races out of nowhere which then makes me think somethings wrong with my heart/heart attack/dying etc, I get attacks that make me feel like I’m going to pass out, and I am super hyper aware and fixated on dying. 
 

 I used to not fear death, figured it was just a part of life. 
 Now I can’t stop obsessing that I’m dying on essentially a daily basis. I feel trapped in my own mind/body.
 

 I guess I just want to know I’m not alone. 💔"
"Anyone currently suffering with health anxiety? 
 

 Mines flared up since I read an article about a young lad dying of pancreatic cancer and now I’ve convinced myself I’m dying from it too.

"Kinda a vent. I'm 25 with SAD and have never had a job. I tried to take the initiative apply for part time jobs as a teen but my mother wouldn't let me. Even time I mentioned the idea she said she didn't want me to work while in school. 
 

 Well I had some set backs in school and things took longer than expected (I was struggling through math classes with discalculia, fun times.) I finally in a position where my mother couldn't make my decisions for me and I had been making some progress with my anxiety like speaking up in class and talking with my professors without trembling. I had applied for a job on campus when Covid shut everything down. The following years of all online school (for the safety of my immuno compromised partner) set me back more both in the school and SAD deparments. 
 

 I just graduated with my bachelor's and I start grad school in August. I'm looking to apply for a part time job in my desired field. It doesn't require any previous work experience and I blow the educstion requirements out of the water. There's also a pretty bad shortage where I'm applying so my chances of landing the job are good. But I'm so scared I want to pull my hair out. 
 

 What do I say if they ask why I have no employment history? That I've had SAD my whole life so mommy wouldn't let me get a job? That I've been scraping by with student loans and the support of my partner because I was so anxious I couldn't work and go to school at the same time? 
 

 I'm terrified of interviewing for the job, I'm terrified of getting the job, and I'm also terrified of NOT getting the job and continuing to be in my mid to late 20s with no employment history to speak of. I'm just frozen with fear- torturing myself with made up ""what ifs""."
"I’m not complaining because it enables me to sleep easier! But does anyones anxiety like vanish when they tuck themselves into bed for the evening with a nice cuppa?

"It’s almost 2am, and I’m beating myself up over the location of my (26F) parent’s house. About 10 years ago, my mom took us (my siblings and I) to view some stands. She wanted our input on where we wanted to stay. I believe I made a comment about one stand, that I now see was the best one. It had a misplaced electricity pole. Now, I see that it could have been moved easily. We ended up getting a stand that is at the end of the other street (away from the main road). Now there’s been some developments around the area, and I can’t stop thinking about how the other location would have been great for business. Especially now that we are struggling financially. I’m not sure that the decision to pick our current location was solely based on my comment, but my mom does take our input into consideration. This eats me up inside and I regret being present for the viewing."
"I (25F) have only ever been in one relationship and I have a lot of anxiety around Relationships in general, dating (fear of losing my family when dating women+trans and nb folks) and sex (fear of getting pregnant when having sex with cis men).

I barely dated in college because I needed to make sure my depression wasn't debilitating when I was in a relationship.

 Lately my friends have been helping me ""get back out there"" (they're amazing and are basically the only reason I'm able to do this) but I still have a lot of anxiety before dates. I'm trying to get over it by forcing myself to go on as many dates as possible but it's still so exhausting. 
 

 How do y'all deal with relationship anxiety? Or anxiety around dating in general?"
"Hey guys I am 25 Female and I have been going through these symptoms for 2 years now. The symptoms then turned into a health body anxiety. Before all of my symptoms I went through some stress about different things. I am not stressed anymore about what bugged me before and that the stress is about these symptoms. 
 

 I really want to know if anyone else has these or does each person have unique symptoms?
 

 I went to so many specialists and I’m not sure what to do or think these symptoms are: 
 -fast heart rate sometimes after eating and different postures trigger it 
 

 -feet prickle with heat like shower or sun and they don’t go numb ever
 

 - upper back shoulder blades feel constantly tight pain 
 -low back pain
 

 -PVCs (palpitations) deep skip feeling just random
 -random sharp pains in back muscles
 

 -tender painful rib under left breast I am told it’s costochondritis?
 

 -hard to breathe I yawn sometimes to breathe 
 - random twitching I see it moving on my upper arms or thighs 
 

 I take B12, D, and Mag supplements. 
 

 I had a lot of blood work for thyroid B12 folate Vitamin D Magnesium CRP ANA C reactive kidneys liver A1C WBC RBC Iron panel allergies etc. Full spine MRI, 4 heart monitors, 3 echocardiograms, ECGs, abdominal ultrasound, breast ultrasound, chest X ray, breathing function test, tilt table test(no POTS), thyroid ultrasound, etc
 

 A lot of drs told me it’s a viscous circle and my GP I go to since I was 13 told me it’s anxiety but I don’t believe that can cause these symptoms
 My neurologist said it’s anxiety somatic symptoms 
 

 What do I do :("
"Just another health-anxiety worrier. Lately after weeks of panic attacks and anxiety I’ve started getting cold and hot flashes during the night. It’s caused my arms to feel cold sensations. 
 

 Anyone else have any experience with that?"
"As the title suggests my anxiety just seems to be getting worse and worse. I have pretty bad health anxiety and my therapist and I are also convinced I have cardiophobia as well. Given that I'm always hyper alert to any pain my body experiences and anxiety itself causes pain I CANNOT stop being anxious at all hours of the day. As soon as wake up I have about 3 seconds to acknowledge my chest doesn't hurt then suddenly it is hurting. It takes me 4 hours of being awake before I feel comfortable even doing anything. I keep having anxiety attacks but am getting to where I can shut them down but only when I'm around someone I trust. I keep calling EMS just in case because I had one so bad in December that my heart rate shot up to 230bpm then it just stopped for about 5 seconds then restarted at a very slow rate causing me to go into shock and having to be rushed to the hospital. Once I see EMS and they confirm I'm ok it goes away but I can't keep doing that. I try to remain calm, breathing exercises, even grounding technics but until I'm around someone that could safely restart my heart or atleast perform CPR I'm fully convinced I'm about to die. It's getting so bad that it's affecting my dreams, not like I'm worried about it in my dreams but I'm just having different dreams in general about being remorseful of life choices and what not. How can I get this under control? How can I stop it from getting worse? How can I just regain normal life and not worry every second of every day if this is my last breath?"
"My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years. We’re moving in together, very happy couple, no issues in the slightest.
 

 However, both of us are adamant that we don’t want biological children. I’m a teacher, and not only does the idea of child birth terrify me but I know how many kids out there deserve a foster home that I can one day adopt. Adoption and fostering is the route we both want to go, it’s perfect for both of us.
 

 Naturally, neither one of us wants kids yet - but that doesn’t mean we’re not sexually intimate with each other. He uses condoms every time. I’m on birth control. He’s talked about getting a vasectomy, etc.
 

 …But now that Roe V Wade has happened, I’m afraid to be intimate with him. No matter how many precautions we take, the small part of my mind is worried about that what if situation. That if all the stars align perfectly… what if?
 

 I almost feel as though I can’t be intimate with him again until he gets a vasectomy, which I’m sure he’s willing to do without a doubt. But… I don’t know when that would happen.
 

 I’ve always been comforted by that small thought of IF something happened, god forbid, I could get an abortion. But now…
 

 Sigh. Anxiety sucks, but a small part of me wonders now if this is warranted…"
"Hello I hope I'm not bothering anyone here. I just want reassurance or advice, if someone else went through something like this.
  I'm feeling like I'm gonna die pretty soon, I have way too many symptoms.
 My throat hurts sometimes, sometimes I feel I have something stuck there, and my voice gets weak 
 Sometimes I spit out blood coming from the throat. (Might be irritated)
 My gut is messed up. Hurts every day, comes and goes, but specially after eating it hurts and I feel nauseous. (I haven't thrown up even once, and my stool looks normal, no blood)
 I have no energy at all these days, I feel like I'm shutting down. (It's too hot outside, and I haven't been sleeping well)
 There's a mole on my armpit that I've had for years and it's always had a weird shape, but now I'm noticing some weird colors on it, like kinda pale at some parts. Never got itchy or hurt. Never got it checked out either.
 I'm freaking out so bad. I feel like I have all kinds of cancer/tumors.
 

 To make it worse, I currently don't have access to medical insurance and can't afford much. 
 Been living under tremendous amounts of stress for the past year. Please help me. I'm desperate"
"Hello everyone.
 

 I am changing job because I have found a vetter one in a role which may be more suited for me. I also get paid more.
 

 The problem I have been working here for 8 months and I feel I haven't contributed much and they invested money on me so that I'm doing something bad to them and their company by leaving now.
 

 I don't really know how to resign. It's a small/medium company and I feel bad, I feel like I'm doing something bad to them because they tries to help me despite me not being good enough even though I know I'm doing this for me..
 

 I am anxious about it, i don't want to give them the news"
"I’m a loner with extreme social anxiety (diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder as a teen but it’s a liiiittle more extreme now).
 

 I can’t even go to the grocery store without her. I guess it stems from being insecure about my looks/intelligence/clothes/personality/literally everything and obsessing over every detail so I feel extreme stage fright (?) when I’m alone in public. When I’m with my partner I feel like it takes the attention off me and nothing can go wrong because she’s there. It is pathetic.
 

 She had to work overtime today and I SHOULD’VE gone to the store to have dinner done when she gets home. Instead, I’m waiting for her to get home so we can go together. I need to get a haircut and wash my car, but today was my only day off and she had to work. So I sat home and did nothing with my dogs all day. Like I do any other time our schedules don’t line up.
 

 I’m a grown ass woman and so tired of needing someone to hold my hand through life. I do not feel like an adult. I somehow managed to land an ok job but I can’t put into words how hard it is to go every day, even after 4 years of working there.
 

 I KNOW I need help but again, can’t go anywhere by myself, can’t reach out by myself, and my partner doesn’t understand the severity of my mental health issues.
 

 Can anyone relate? Like, years ago I looked forward to finding a job I liked, buying a house, having kids and just LIVING. Now I get asked when I’ll have kids and I’m like dude I can’t even function and I would be homeless if it wasn’t for my gf???)
 

 It’s embarrassing even posting this."
"Is this an anxiety thing. 
 

 So basically sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and my whole body will feel numb, heavy and on edge. 
 

 This will usually last for 30 minutes, until eventually I'll fall back asleep again. 
 

 Is this something anxiety causes? Really odd when it happens. 
 

 Any tips on how to consistently get a good night's sleep without waking up mid sleep?"
"I feel like I check my pulse on my neck almost every 10 minutes and every time I feel a bit off. 
 

 I never even used to think twice about my pulse.
 

 Pretty certain it triggers some of my panic attacks as well if I feel it and to me it feels off. 
 

 Any advice on how to resist the urge to do it all the time?"
"I always get feelings like I'm moving in slow mo and my arms aren't mine or aren't communicating with my brain. Is this depersonalisation? 
 

 I just wanted advice on how to treat this? 
 

 Also I obsess over my heart constantly is there any advice on how to get make to a stage where I don't even think twice about my heart?"
"26M Millennial here and pretty much everyone I've known has had their ""wild"" phase where they've done one kind drug or another. I've never gotten high before or smoked regularly and only recently (past year or so) drink occasionally (usually just so I can socialize properly by getting buzzed). 
 One time I was with a group and word got out that I've never even got drunk before and people were amazed... It was embarrassing..."
"So I (27m) am trying to improve my SA and I think I’ve come a long ways from where I used to be. I still have my moments but I can basically fake being “normal” although I have my limits. Today at work, I realized something that I never knew, or to be precise, never considered. I went to another coworkers desk to get some office supplies, I just said hi and made a cringe comment as I usually do (it helps lighten up my anxiety) and I asked for the supplies. There were 3 of them sitting together and one of the girls said to me “oh so your getting something, how come you never come to just say hi.”
 

 In that moment, I just mentioned the fact that I’m always so busy (it’s true but realistically, that doesn’t mean I don’t have time to chat). I just don’t have the ability to make conversation or talk for the sake of talking. That’s always been my biggest anxiety, I just don’t know how to make conversation so I’ve grown up using excuses to talk to someone as a reason to talk to someone. The fact is, people appreciate being thought of and yet I’ve never been able to demonstrate that because I use an objective to speak to someone rather than speaking to someone as an objective. It just doesn’t come across sincere."
"Hello all!
 Lately I've been super stressed due to my upcoming wedding, upon other things. I have been super anxious and emotional. Also I've been feeling really sluggish, tired, foggy and maybe a little dizzy. Has anyone else dealt with this? Any ways to feel better? Any advice or input is greatly appreciated!"

"I'm 28 and have been to the ER/doctors a good dozen times in the last couple years. I keep going because up until I was 27 I had an average American diet and drank a ton of soda. I smoked cigarettes from age 20-21 and quit. I was dealing with severe depression and very significant clinical ocd and smoked out of stress. I'm so paranoid that I'm going to get or already have COPD, Lung cancer, Kidney disease, diabetes 2, hcv, or hiv. I've done therapy, every ssri known to man, all I do from the moment I wake up to go to bed is worry about my health. I'm so scared I'm going to get sick and my anxiety is absolutely through the roof. I want to get better. I'm eating really clean now and am 164lbs down from 204 a year ago."
"July 5th. I’m dreading it. 
 

 I have my learners and since I’m 29F it’s hard for me to practice my driving on a daily basis because I don’t own a car yet, and my boyfriend drives an expensive one so I don’t want to risk bumping into something/someone. Everyone else is either too busy or scared to let me drive their car unassured. 
 

 I just got home from work. I work out of town so it’s a one hour commute twice a day. My coworker let me drive her car back to town to make me practice since my road test is in less than two weeks. I didn’t see the car behind me (blindspot) while changing lanes on the highway and it could’ve been really dangerous. It made me stressed af for the rest of the entire ride. I do feel a little bit more comfortable driving in town or residential areas but I absolutely have to pass this goddamn test because I’m moving to a remote location next month and I’ll have to rely on myself for transportation.
 

 This highway I take everyday to go to work is straight up chaotic; I’ve witnessed 3 fatal accidents there in the past few months… One man got hit on his bicycle, the other one on his motorcycle and then someone I know hit a deer. They were all traumatic obviously so I can’t see how I can build more confidence within myself and my driving skills as a novice driver when it seems that the worst case scenarios happen a lot on this road. 
 

 I’m kinda mad at myself for not getting my driver’s license at 16yrs old like everyone else does. Now I’m stuck with feeling fearful and anxious all the time when I drive. I don’t even want to think about the day I’ll start driving alone…"
"My biggest issue with anxiety &amp; panic attacks is that I tend to worry that If I have an event coming up (meeting with friends, using public transport, going to my girlfriend etc.) That I might feel anxious or might get a panic attack and either have to cancel or completely change the plans. And the worries spiral out of control which in turn guarantees there will be a panic attack. I've had CBT, I've had meditation classes, I'm on medication, I'm regulary doing self initiated exposure therapy. But I'm still in this vicious cycle. Does anyone have advice of stopping the fear of fear?"
"I started this job recently in which my boss misbehaves with his entire team. Day in and day out it's a just full scale screaming(it's his nature apparently and he behaves this way with all 32 members) which makes even the smallest of the tasks seem like a mountain. i have been pushed into doing something without even an iota of training.
 

 for my entire life i have suffered from crippling anxiety and this perticular instance has now started to trigger it again.
 I don't feel like eating or talking to my family, even new day i am scared /anxious 24X7 as to what's going to happen today.
 

 I am clueless now"
"Hi! I really hope I am not alone. I am 25 Female and have been going through so many symptoms for a few years now and it’s creating body anxiety since it’s every day I feel like this. 
 

 I still get these skip feelings palpitations at random sometimes during and after exercise or rest, fast heart rate pounding when I move around the house or bend forward and stand up or when I’m changing. 
 

 I have been to my cardiologist and had chest x ray, blood work, tilt table test rule out POTS, stress test with ECG on and echocardiogram after, echocardiogram, 3 monitors for a week each, and ECGs in the office like 5 times now. I kept asking if I need more tests but it wasn’t recommended. Was that enough testing? I am scared I have some hole in my heart not seen or just some kind of heart issue. I am just living every day thinking about my heart and feeling it. I am told my heart is structurally normal and my heart rate is in range and that my resting when I am sleeping is average in the 60s. I take magnesium glycinate 360 mg btw.
 

 I have other symptoms too told it’s anxiety: random rib chest back muscle pains (I had a full spine MRI) and feet prickle when they get hot(I went to my neurologist she said it’s not neuropathy or anything)"
"Funny thinking about how introverted i was in situations and not knowing why or what I was doing at the time, but ive realized I've had the same introverted tendenciesies ever since i could remember. 
 

 i tried being the opposite and more extroverted around 17-21 when i had my first girlfriends, makes me cringe a little thinking of the person i was and how awkward literally every single interaction ive had was, looking back feeling completely alien, the same as i do now, but not in a positive way. I quit my 1st retail job around the same time and stopped seeing friends. was becoming miserable and all of it is just so exhausting and is exhausting just thinking about the small number of things i did in my extrovert phase, which is almost 100% you being influenced by your environment and who you hang around, i also remember having some FOMO around this age, which doesn't exist now; I crave being left out lmao. 
 

 Always kept myself busy with hobbies, trying and learning new things that i looked at one point in time to be completely impossible to obtain. I cherish my time in solitude; I got a decent amount of opportunities/possibilities because of what i'm able to teach myself. but i'd rather be dead than have to get a normal job with people.I just wanna make shit by myself and ship it out. its a struggle to even go out to the post office. 
 

 Got a lot of anxiety in general, had gotten worse as i got older. Only time im out is to ride my electric toys, and i avoid everybody during this time, some people try to flag me down...i just dont care i want to be left alone..
 im a fast thinker so the convo is always flowing, i can talk about any topic but is completely taxing on me. My introversion is like a light switch with an almost dead battery, once its on, its on, but not for long.
 

 

 i think i'm good at it because it's something that i was once so bad at i had to learn to adapt. I've abandoned the idea of getting a girlfriend, I don't reach out to anyone, ive realized im kinda picky. I know i could definitely get almost any girl i want if i went out and tried but I'm completely over all that. Don't even mention a going to club, im laughing already. Dating apps are garbage for men - attractive or not.
 

 I like to look at myself from another person point of view(stranger or family) and how anybody would think im lying about all this or thinking to deep into it too. Its funny how i've completely fooled everyone I know, they don't got a clue. I feel like an actor sometimes. I can't even ask for the help I really want to ask for. Really though, is there any solution? i went to the doc once to get a ""note for anexity"" to give to my work so they wouldn't put me in the frontend. the doc mentioned the medication would be a sort of tranquilizer. This picture sums it up. https://imgur.com/a/0TS8416
 

 Whatever mental deficiencies i got also has its benefits. I see it all the time now, the almost photographic memory, the undiagnosed adhd as served me well(or not); I'm 25 so it took a while for me to really know myself, go back 10 years ago and i was on the opposite end; i was retarded and failing all my highschool classes multiple times in a row for the first 3 years, didn't understand anything, and I sat there like a dumb fat caveman.
 

 

 

 as im writing this it just sounds like random thoughts about hey look how fucking broken i am but they all kinda help paint the picture. take this whole post as what you make of it, i'm sort just ranting and getting my thoughts on paper."
"I was just wondering if anyone does this. I (26F) have had my license for 3 years now and I've gotten better at driving thanks to my husband who even taught me how to reverse park. My dad has been MIA, so combined with my CRIPPLING anxiety and lack of practice in the real world, my driving wasn't always great.
 

 I have found that planning my trips (even to the dentist) with google maps' street view has significantly lessened my anxiety by about 65%? Knowing what turns to make, what the roads look like, how my destination looks like, etc. has made me a better driver. 
 

 

 Does anyone else do this?"
"It feels like my hands aren't connected to me or they're really slow to move. 
 

 Constant tingling in them as well. 
 

 What the hell is this? Is this normal? How can I snap out of it?"
"So finally cracked after 9 months and realised I need something to help with this health anxiety. 
 

 I'm starting on 15mg. 
 

 Any success stories in terms of helping with the physical symptoms anxiety creates? Energy? Sleep? General happiness etc? 
 

 Finally giving in as I need my life back from this hell I've been living in for almost the past year."
"Throughout my work career, I normally take an hour train right to work.
 

 Usually due to the morning peak, I wouldn't be able to find a seat for the entire hour. And if I don't find a seat for that hour long ride, 80% of the time I would get cold sweat and really bad stomach ache, and breathless and lightheaded. I always try to hold it as I'm in the middle of my ride and honestly I don't arrive work early, so I don't want to be wasting time getting out of the train. But more often than not, whenever I felt I'm might be blacking out, I would exit the train and catch a breath at the train platform. Usually when this happens, it is halfway through my ride, and coincidently it is underground (so not sure if its anxiety or claustrophobic)
 

 If I am able to find a seat, 99% of the time this won't happen.
 

 Since covid, I have been working from home so all is good, and even if I had to go to the office, I would still be able to find seats as the number of people going to office now is being restricted.
 

 However I have a new problem. Now my stomach ache will come the very moment I decide to leave my house for work. No matter how early I wake up to give myself ample time for this ""stomach ache"" to happen, it will only happen when I decide to actually leave my house.
 

 Is my body rejecting work or everything is a coincidence (eg I'm actually claustrophobic not panic, or I'm just having a poop day)?
 

 Some background: 
 my poop frequency is normally 4 days - 1.5 weeks
 I am 25 yo 158cm at 39-40kg.
 I used to be 44kg at my highest 4 years ago (considered myself a big eater as I always have 2 bowl of rice for meal). 
 Lost appetite since end of 2019 and maintain at 41 kg for the past few years. 
 In the past 12 months, dropped to 39 kg on days, I am weighing lesser than I was at 16 years old."

 I am in Therapy, Psychiatry, AA &amp; NA meetings, and soon to be IOP. I’m almost 6 years sober but my body has virtually never stopped feeling like hell. 
 

 Desperately looking for help from other professionals or anyone who has gone/is going through anything similar. 
 

 My anxiety triggers terrible muscle spasms throughout my body and vice versa, but my muscles tend to stay knotted up unless I repeat the movement. Almost like the way a snake squeezes tighter the more something fights it, but in my case I’m trying exercises and tools I’ve learned from physical therapy/psychotherapy only for it to make it worse. The feeling is from within and is as if it’s pushing up outwards.
 

 It became overwhelming to the point where I’ve hardly been able bathe myself in the shower, have to force my mouth open to eat/brush my teeth, or even wash dishes. Mortifying. I haven’t been able to hold a regular job for longer than a month or two after all these years. 
 

 I used to think it was just poor mental health but a few doctors/therapists I’m seeing have said that this may not just be psychological. 
 

 Physical therapy, acupuncture, yoga and chiro did not work. CBD, hot/cold water therapy, and stretching/breathing exercises don’t work. 
 

 MRIs of my entire spine and head were clear except for very mild DDD in lumbar and nasal polyps/sinus inflammation. But my neurologist said after a year of appointments he does not think it’s a neurological issue but maybe a neuromuscular disorder/disease. I was tested for Lyme disease and that came back clear. 
 

 Does anyone else deal with this potential spasticity? I’m currently seeing my PCP, neurologist, pain management doctor, therapist, psychiatrist, and just started seeing a podiatrist and cardiologist. 
 

 I’m currently taking:
 

 Paroxetine 40 mg once at bedtime
 Seroquel 200 mg once a day a bedtime 
 Buspirone 15mg 3x a day 
 Hydroxyzine 50mg 3 times a day or as needed
 Ativan .5 mg as needed (only have 1 of a 7 day trial left) 
 

 The couple times I’ve gone to urgent care I was given 5 days worth of prednisone and that helped a decent amount short term. Tried gabapentin and topiramate with my pain management doctor but the side effects were too much. Chlorzoxazone and baclofen didn’t really work either. 
 

 Thanks a million for any and all help. Much love and strength to you all."
"I(m25) just heard a podcast about anxiety disorder. The podcast is made by a professional psychological therapist, educating about psychological phenomena.
 

 My GF(20) struggles with every diagnosis checkbox. She checked everything.
 Well, she doesn’t really, because she doesn’t know right know. 
 

 I’m going through a process with her, she knows something is up but doesn’t at all has a hinge on what. She speaks a lot about having anxiety (naming it specifically) but doesn’t really think about having an anxiety disorder.
 

 I’d like to tell her about it, it’s clear that she needs psychological support, I can of cause not push her into it. 
 

 

 Do you think it’s worth telling her about it? I’d like to show her the podcast so she can think about it herself. Do you it that’s a worthwhile action?
 

 I am also thinking about how I can set up myself. I want to help her, id say I am mostly just there going through her phase right now, it’s hitting hard on her, depressive symptoms and sleep deprivation on top makes her life with a suicidal mother and going through university to study mathematics quite difficult.
 

 Thanks in advance!
 

 

 Edit: Questioning specific behaviour, I’ll try to let you know what I can see for myself.
 

 Current problems are huge problems with sleep (not being able to sleep for a whole night, maybe even two, which explains her search for benzos)
 

 Neck pain, back pain, upper stomach pain
 

 Difficulties concentrating
 Avoiding difficult situations 
 

 She had at least one anxiety attack I went through with her. She mostly wanted to feel numb, not having to feel it. It wasn’t a panic attack, she knew exactly where she was and didn’t go into a fight-flight response.
 

 No matter the current circumstances, there’s always a sense of: being scared of university, failing
 Being scared for her mother (understandably)
 Evaluating people from: Do they want something negative from her, did she in any way upset them (this one BIG TIME) 
 

 Worrying A LOT about other peoples emotions, what she could have done wrong and what she would have to do to NOT make it wrong (note that I’m phrasing it that way. I’m deliberately not saying “how to make it right”)
 

 Always having to stay in motion. Wakes up 07:00AM, goes through university, takes a break as drinking coffee, going on a really fast walk
 (I am a Runner, I really mean fast)
 

 More work (being worried she can’t get all the work done)
 

 Eating, going on a second walk or stretching
 

 After uni is done: cycling for in the nearest forest, walking there for two hours. Being “a bit more calm”
 

 Now what’s not there: no laying around. No relaxing with a bock. No break in which she would sit there sipping a tea. No relaxed walks. 
 I dunno how to explain it, it’s like all time everyday she’s pushed to go, but not in the good sense.
 

 So there’s a lot of hyperactivity involved, but she is in general able to concentrate well for longer periods of time.
 

 Things that scare her (a street where she could possibly see her ex boyfriend is strictly not used, even though it’s the main road)
 

 There was a lot of stress about me “possibly” leaving her, in which she tried to convince me she’s bad for me. I more or less said “Nah, not gonna happen” to that, which worked well.
 

 

 Yeah so, here we are."
"I'm not sure if it is a ""true"" personality or just a personality I desire to have or achieve. But when I try imagine my ""future"" self I kinda envision this strong, wise (wise due to my struggles with anxiety and depression and so) , and ""posh""/confident person that doesn't care what people think and etc. I often feel like I have a conflicting personality where I'm thinking that if it wasn't for these and these persons I would probably be more like this and that e.g. more of a risk taker or a person not scared to do this or that. Like, I have all these internal desires that I don't manage to ""play out"" due to my anxiety. Like walking in heels whenever without any special occasion but I'm scared of comments from friends and family because it ""doesn't seem like me"" when it actually does, it's just that I don't have the guts to do/show it."
So i just took an antibiotic for a uti. I have had bad experiences with some antibiotics in the past like allergic reactions. This is a different one so it might be ok. I am terrified. It is one amtibiotic that is supposed to work for 3 days. Pls help me calm down
"There are a few reasons I hesitate to tell
 1. I am bad at explaining or I sometimes think that they wouldn't understand.
 2. They are not that close to me. I am just like a stranger to them.
 3. They may not be interested. Probably just asked for formality. 
 Maybe there are more reasons but I don't realize. 
 

 Do you think I should share anything with them? I think most of us keep it to ourselves. Few of us don't have anyone to share it with. 
 

 Or it has to be like the way it is. That's why they say your life is your responsibility. It's like I am being too much dependent. Or I am expecting too much."
"I am 27 years old and I have been smoking nearly all my life 
 

 I've also had anxiety/panic disorder my whole life too and thus I'm pretty used to panic attacks and anxiety making symptoms feel real even though it's just anxiety. 
 

 Well today at a friends I hit a dab on his dab rig and not even seconds later I'm feeling a pressure on my chest and my heart is racing. Hands started tingling and all. 
 

 Home now 4 hours later and I'm fine
 

 Just a daily reminder that anxiety can make you feel like you're having a heart attack when you are not."
"I apologize for the long post but i really need to share this
 

 So im not really a redditor but i have seen alot of good advice given here and decided that maybe posting could possibly help me out.
 

 Also not sure if i am in the right place to post this but i will share it anyways.
 

 I am 27 years old and i am not quite sure what exactly has been going on with me ever since i started maturing as a kid i have became more and more distant with friends to the point i dont even have any friends anymore. (Say what you want but as i type this i do not have one person i can call to talk to)
 

 Anyways ever since i started maturing i started noticing that i would have slight anxiety and paranoia (sorry if i misspell) when going out or meeting with friends or overthinking to the point where i would not even go out.
 

 Anxious part - 
 A few years back when it started getting really bad i would wake up in the morning and my heart would constantly be racing to the point i would get sick and throw up and it feels like my chest is constantly restricted and i have to focus on breathing normally and even trying to do breathing excercises it seemed to not do a single thing. And its not like oh i have a speech or interview anxiousness it is like this from the point i wake up until i go to sleep. Some nights i cant even sleep due to being so anxious. I will get 2-3 hours of sleep wake up with the same anxiety go through my whole day and when i lay down later to go to sleep the anxiety will literally keep me up all night. Sometimes 2 days without sleep and then of course eventually my body will crash. Then the cycle will start again. The anxiety gets so bad at times that i even have trouble speaking and having a conversation is out the window because for some reason i have no interest in conversations nor can i hold one. I honestly have to force myself to try and keep a conversation but 100 percent of the time i feel the need to absolutely say nothing at all because my brain says i have no interest in having one nor do i care about what we are talking about or it will go completely blank and i just wont have any response. I even have terrible anxiety typing this and i feel like i am doing something completely wrong. I did not sleep last night and i will not sleep tonight as well. This is an ongoing cycle
 

  There is much more to this but i hope you understand the concept of what i am going through.
 

 The paranoid part- 
 so it started with the anxiety, then i started noticing that i am becoming very paranoid. (No i do not hear voices or anything like that) however lets say if i go to the store to get some items. I will constantly feel that everyone is looking at me, or they know that something is wrong with me in which will make me focus extremely hard on the way im walking or i will just keep reminding myself over and over the reason for being in the store etc to try to keep my mind off it. I used to be a gym rat until the paranoia started because i honestly felt like every movement i did was weird or even talking with someone i had started having a really hard time with eye contact when socializing so my responses are literally one words like ""yeah"" ""oh cool"" ""right"" etc. I have a hard time going anywhere anymore even driving and when im at a red light with other cars it will make me extremely paranoid i will start messing with the radio or moving things around in my car. I feel horrible because even when i visit family for dinners and such i dont talk at all or i just cant find the words to conversate when about 5 years ago i was a totally different person when it came to socializing with family. The anxiety part i have lived with forever and learned to cope with it however since the onset of this paranoia feeling i feel like everything is out of my control and i am in a state of complete hopelessness
 

 These have led to me leaving my job, losing a relationship of 4 years, becoming isolated and having no interest in hobbies or anything at all. I have become emotionless and i dont know why. 
 

 Im sorry if i didnt explain this well but im just really trying to figure out what is happening here.
 

 I have spoken to a doctor and they have wanted to put me on anti depressants and such however i know they dont fully understand what im going through. 
 

 If anyone is familiar with behavior like this any advice is appreciated. I dont know what is going wrong with me or who i should talk to or what i should do."
"Does anyone else just get anxiety for any physical feeling the body has? 
 

 I will get sleepy and boom anxiety. I have to use the bathroom? Boom anxiety. Im hungry? Also anxiety. 
 

 Its like my body has forgotten how to process the difference between actual anxiety and just normal everyday necessities…. 
 

 Does anyone else experience this? Is this normal?? I actually have no clue."
"I'm pretty certain that I've been dealing with social anxiety for as long as I can remember. I would say that I'm high functioning, since I'm able to hold down a job and have some close relationships, but I still deal with things that effect my quality of life like constant overthinking, being afraid to socialize, insomnia, etc. I do practice mindfulness meditation, which I found really does help me to relax and calm down my mind, but there's some days when I'm in such a bad headspace that not even that is enough. Sometimes I feel like I would benefit from a medication, because I already have other healthy coping techniques that work, but I still feel like I need an extra boost to be the best version of myself. I'm gonna see a new PCP soon and may inquire about starting an anti anxiety medication. I just always hear so many mixed reviews that I'm also still a bit hesitant to try lol Anyone care to share their experiences?"
"So i have pretty severe health anxiety, and recently my throat has been so tight and sore its hurting into my tongue. When i wake up in the morning its fine but then it starts to tighten through the day and somedays i feel like its so tight itll close but i try and drink and breathe and eat and i can do all of those just fine. Ive never had throat tightness this tight before and im hoping its my anxiety but im scared its throat cancer… does anyone experience this?"
29F and I feel like I'm really behind in life because of my SA. Everyone I know is married with kids and I can't even date.
"27(F) 
 Recently I went to a colorectal doctor for a Pilonidal cyst. When I got in the room with the doctor he looked at his computer and said “your file says you have PTSD, why?” 
 I was very confused and all I could think to say was “…psychological and other trauma” 
 He responded with “well what kind of trauma, what happened to you?”
 I said “um, some traumatic things, I’m not really okay with talking about it.”
 He seemed annoyed and moved on to the more usual questions regarding my cyst. 
 I left feeling weird about it, is that a normal thing to ask? I know my file says a lot of things my anxiety disorder, my ocd and my ptsd; it just seemed so odd to ask someone that question."
"Hey, so i have a huge fear of getting chronic utis. Just imagining just getting over one and then getting another is just horrifying. Then the antibiotics..i am fucking terrified of antibiotics. So far all i have tried except one have been good to me...I just have been googling uti and antibiotcs related things for the past 3 days. I cant take it.."
"So i have guinea pigs and their cage is on the floor, and im fatter so when i sit on my legs it kinda hurts so i try not to do it for too long. 
 Well today i feel like i put too much weight on my legs and i gave myself a blood clot from the pressure. As the back of my legs are tingly and sore and i have like pain inside my thigh as well which makes me scared its my femoral artery. So )-: can anyone quell my fears"
"Firstly, so sorry for my English. I'm not a native - english speaker. 
 

 I've been developing fear of getting arrested for about a year now. Like for no reason. did a little research and find out it actually anxiety. Everything that happens to me ( even how small) will result of me thinking I'll be put in jail. I'll replay every scenarios and predicting future possibility and can't seem to put my mind at rest. 
 

 But one thing that bother me right now is the message that I text my friend five years ago. In 2017, I was 21 back then( now I'm 26 ). At that age, I was so much more naive, crazy and more impulsive than now and sent to my friend a bunch of messages about one topic. We were joking about that topic.( sorry can't say in specific. You guys just need to know its just sensitive to talk about and can get me into trouble if it's somehow got leaked out). Then five years passed on, yet, nothing has happened to me, but I can't seem to put my mind at rest over it. Three years ago - 2019 - I contact back to her and told her to delete the conversation of that message ( in a tricky way) and seem like she wasn't remember what I said in the message . She's just delete it and not serious about what I sent her. This put my mind at rest for a while because she wasn't serious about the message like I do. But till this day - in 2022 - I still think about the possibility that she might have screenshot the message and sent it to another friend and that friend sent it to another friend and so on... 
 

 I've panic attack about three days ago, and cry and hyperventilating. I kept thinking about what may happen in the future and how serious it is if those messages get leak out in a screenshot form. I tried to be logical about things and it help for a while but can't seem to break out of this cycle. I feel like I'm a bad, shitty person even I didn't mean to hurt anyone when I wrote them years ago. I've learned a lesson. Real BIG lesson. I'm much more mature now, and changed but I'm regret and fearful and uncertain about my future. My career goals are being distracted and I cannot focus on my daily tasks. 
 

 I think maybe I'll try to go to therapy and come into closure with her one day, but don't know for sure if she's telling the truth or be serious about it. We are not in contact for a long time . Maybe she did screenshot it and sent it to somebody and they didn't really care? But it's still bother me and the uncertainty about my future is just scary. 
 

 I wish everybody who is currently reading this have a safe and happy day ahead. Thank you for listening."
My family has always been toxic towards me. My mom is the main person that manipulates people to hate me and dislike me. My brother now cuts contact with me and my grandparents also. I am the black sheep of the family. My mom blames everything wrong on me only and today she even said my grandma had a stroke after her call with me. I cried and cried and I don't understand why my life is so bad.
"26(F) y’all, when I tell you WHENEVER I’m anxious (which is like 23 hours out of the day) my body makes me extremely nauseous AND immediate poops/gas (sorry tmi). I’m either needing to throw up (but don’t) or just continually going to the bathroom to unleash diarrhea/and or gas out my whole family. Yet I’m overweight. It makes zero sense. 
 Anyone else? Please say I’m not alone lol."
"Let me start off by saying I've struggled with anxiety my whole life, and was diagnosed with GAD when I was 19. Throughout the years I've learned to cope with my anxiety, but I definitely flare up from time to time. This was an ENTIRELY different experience.
 

 This morning I woke up, a little tired, but nothing out of the ordinary. I did have a stressful day of work ahead, as well as some personal plans that made my day pretty packed. Lately, my social life has been super busy so I haven't had a lot of time for myself and have been feeling constantly overwhelmed.
 

 I left work early because all of a sudden I was getting a slight headache, which I thought was just eye strain. When I went home, I immediately felt worse. I had chills all over my body and aches. It felt almost somewhat like one of my run-of-the-mill anxiety attacks but one thing was very different. I started feeling hot, light-headed, and sweaty. I checked my temp and I had a 101 degree fever. Forty-five minutes later, my fever was 104.3!!!! Immediately I think ""Oh I'm sick af"" call kaiser, and they tell me to track my fever overnight.
 

 However 5 hours later, my fever is completely gone. I've check my temp twice in the last hour and its maintained a perfect 98.7. Did I just give myself a psychogenic fever??? I feel totally fine now other than now I'm freaked out because I had no idea my anxiety was capable of this??? Should I talk to my doctor about my stress level if it's causing such extreme physical effects?????"
So I apparently had a uti. I took some antibiotcs. The last day of the antibiotcs I did an at home strip test yesteray and it came back clear. Then today i did another and leukocytes where there again. This morning i went to the doctor and he said there were no bactera and I was almost healed whatever that means. I guess there were still leukocytes. But how can it be that yesterday the test showed nothing and today it is showing again but apparently no bacteria. I am so fucking afriad i will get chronic utis and never recover. I am paniking right now😭

"Hi everyone I’m 26f and just struggling. I was diagnosed with adhd when I was young. I’ve also been diagnosed with depression and ptsd. Over the years my depression has gotten better and I am off anti depressants. But recently my anxiety has been through the roof. I think it is a mix of social anxiety from covid and I am also a mother of a toddler and that alone gives me anxiety. I’m at the point where I feel like I can’t even function as a mother, partner and grad student. 
 

 I am wondering if anyone feels the same- and has found a medication that helps. Something that helps anxiety but doesn’t worsen adhd. (I do not like or do well with adhd medications) 
 

 Thanks in advance :(:"
I'm always scared. I hate this. I just want to be a kid again.
"I work at walmart and i’m very quiet..well i’ve has two coworkers ask me if i’m okay..she told me i can tell her anything and she told me to smile. She told me i look sad. It makes me rethink if anything is going on in my life that’s upsetting me currently. It felt like a good day today besides them asking me that and making me overthink now lol., does this happen to anyone else? I’ve actually had someone else last week tell me to smile and that it’s going to be a good day and i’ll be okay. i just don’t know how to respond or feel..advice?"
"Nausea and stomach issues are my number one problem when im in survival mode. Its hard to eat bc im afraid to upset my stomach however when i eat it doesnt upset my stomach and its more upset when i dont eat something. But i still get scared to eat bc of the feeling. But also when i eat or drink it gets very full very quickly. Ive gone to the doctor and they said i had gastritis and acid reflux with constipation. So ive tried cleaning up my diet, taking my omeprazole and taking my probiotics.. however i still feel icky and worn out. How do i feel better quicker? How long does the stomach stuff last for you guys? I started last tuesday. And while it has gotten better. I still worry ill be like this forever"
"Through some medication changes, I realized I had depression that was covering up severe anxiety symptoms. I recently learned that these symptoms began manifesting into physical form at a very young age, starting with social anxiety and multiplying.  
 

 My entire life has revolved around this and I had no idea. I thought I was getting old and weak and always in pain, but it was just my anxiety telling me these things. So many hyper analyzed situations, so many ruined vacations. I could never keep a hobby because my frustrations would become overwhelming. I began to shut down, depersonalize and compartmentalize.  
 

 With the help of therapy and deep muscle relaxation techniques (with loooots of deep breathing through the day), I’m beginning to understand and accept myself! I have never been able to accept who I was, because it felt like everyone and myself told me differently. I can begin to repair my relationship with my wife, and hopefully start my life again. It’s going to be a slow process and a hard one, but I wanted to share my experiences because I found the more i know about myself, the easier it is to handle my emotions and anxieties.  
 I am 28 years old and (when the anxiety is handled), I feel like I have a fresh start. Don’t feel like you’re hated by everyone and yourself. You are loved, and you are special. You have a mental health sickness that makes things very irrational and difficult. You aren’t crazy.  
 Sorry for the long post. I’m learning a lot of new stuff about myself, and relearning a lot of old things I forgot."
"I have had anxiety nearly my whole life (27 male) and i've just sort of dealt with it, no medicine or anything.
 

 I live a very sedentary life style (not good I know) and most the past few years have been me sitting on my ass and playing video games with friends, hardly any exercise at all in my daily routine.
 

 At the start of this year I developed a strange symptom that I immediately tied to being anxiety.
 

 I have felt short of breath nearly all year and it feels like i have to yawn every 2 minutes to get a satisfying deep breath. This has been happening for about 5 months now.
 

 I will be going to a Dr as soon as i can (only have medicaid insurance) and I'll get a checkup for the first time in years to rule out any of the big bad stuff.
 

 Just recently I've started to try to attack the anxious feelings and the breathing anxiety (if thats what it is) with exercise.
 

 I am 5'9 and 140 lbs &amp; even though I may not look it, I am very out of shape.
 

 I have started by doing a jumping jack routine for about 5-7 minutes the past few days and im amazed at how much better it makes me feel. Am i out of breath and cant even finish the full exercise video? yes i am but i assume thats normal for someone who hardly gets any exercise right?
 

 I am hoping if this ""air hunger"" thing does turn out to be just from anxiety that I can continue to exercise and it will go away.
 

 I wake up feeling super out of breath and yawning a lot so it feels like my body is telling me NOT to exercise but after i do it my breathing feels better (if only just a little bit)
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 If this air hunger problem is not anxiety I'm assuming it's a vitamin deficiency of some sort (b12, iron)
 

 or it could be a result of the many years I've had GERD and haven't treated it
 

 The hypochondriac in me is screaming it's a heart issue and that I'll drop dead any second now :)"
"I (f26) failed my driving test twice back when I was 19 and was discouraged by my family to try again and no one really was around to try to teach me or let me use their car, so I never really ended up able to drive too much other than from work to home or from college to home with my dad as long as it wasn't raining or something. The car I used though broke down forever like two years ago.
 

 I'm getting tired of having to bother people for rides or spend money on ubers and stuff so I think I just want to take the test and get it over with.
 

 My plan is to go to the DPS and get my vision test done so that I can get my permit and from there just pay the money to go to an actual driving school and take lessons and test for my license from there.
 

 On that day though, I'm considering taking the driving test. Not with any expectations to pass really, but just to desensitize myself to the experience of having to take a driving test because the mere thought of having to take a driving test makes me anxious. Would that be a waste of time or should I do that?
 

 I don't care how much money I spend or how many times I try. I just want to get my license already."
I think I'm dying. I constantly think I'm dying. That I have some sort of cancer or whatever even though I'm 27 and have no preexisting illness. I feel like I have ants crawling under my skin. I just want it to stop. I just want it to stop for the love of God
"I'm 27 and have been having a hard time recognizing myself recently. 
 

 I have 1 friend I never hang out with (we text), and a boyfriend who has a social life, unlike me. 
 

 I feel like I can only let minimal amounts of people close to me, because it's exhausting for me to be around others. I'm always overthinking it all, and wondering what they expect from me. Which I realize isn't normal. I get very anxious about time and how long I am away from my comfort zone (home). 
 

 Now I'm 27, jealous of all of my boyfriend's very long term friendships, and feel like I'm very alone in most aspects. Sure I have family, but they have their own lives. If I ever have kids they'll never know my ""friends"" like I did with my parents growing up. I'm still very close to their friends. I think it's weird that I have no life long friends. 
 

 I guess I just don't feel real, or like many people think of me outside of my boyfriend and my friend. And I know it's my fault, but how do you become social at 27? Am I the only one in the world who has no childhood friends, at all? Because I've always been an anxiety ridden mess who ghosts anyone who remotely hurts me? 
 

 I'm currently off a lot of my meds as well currently, due to insurance loss a few months ago, but hoping to start them again in a few weeks. Don't recommend withdrawling off Lexapro after being on it 5 years, brain zaps are a real deal and strange. They were so uncomfortable I honestly question going back on it at all, just because I'm scared to go through that ever again. 
 

 Tldr; I'm 27 and have no friends and my anxiety has been awful and now I don't feel real, or worthy, because I have no life long friends. Am I alone? How do I aquire social skills."
Hi all long story short I'm 28 overdosed at 18 and i got panic attacks the day after and diagnosed with gad after seeing multiple people and the huge lack of service as you all know the last person i saw i managed to make a connection and she belived my anxiety was caused by unstable relationships. I have been single for 10 years and i get panic attacks when i get to intimate with someone. I am currently waiting to be seen again but i was wondering if anyone has any source's on this theory and possibly advice. I have no friends as i have burned all them bridges really now i had a close colleague at work whom i really grew close to but we fell out then my depression just generally got bad it was only last week i thought about what my therapist said and i wondered if my anxiety/depression was caused by this and how can i get to the bottom of this thanks robbie
"Hey everyone just joined reddit and found this sub. I am hoping someone can point me in the right direction. To the best of my knowledge ive never had anxiety my whole life. I'm 25 years old and a few months ago my brother killed himself with a shotgun in my parents house and i happened to be the one that saw him first. I cant even describe how bad the scene looked, all 4 corners of the wall were spattered with blood and even on the ceiling, not to mention he was unrecognizable. Anyway, I ended up making it thru the funeral and a couple weeks just fine.  
 

 Then all of a sudden it hit me like a brick...I find myself unable to stand sometimes and need to sit down, then the sweats start coming along with rapid heartbeats. This will happen for like an hour and then it goes away. I can't seem to get the images out of my damn head. This keeps me up until at least 4-5am every night. I have recently lost my job where I made well over six figures because i was so sleep deprived I couldn't function and passed out on the floor at my desk. 
 

 My family doctor wants to put me on 2 different medicines and told me there are tons of side effects that i am really afraid are going to turn me into a zombie. He also seemed to brush it off and said you will get over this eventually just tough it out. Really not what I was looking for. Any suggestions other than breathing exercises and taking melatonin at night would very much be appreciated!"
"I have had a whirl wind happening recently and these are some of my fears. 
 

 • Necrotizing faciaitis
 • MRSA
 • Blood clots
 • Heart attacks
 • Celluitis
 • infections of any kind
 • needing to be hospitalized
 • pulmonary embolism
 • aneurysms
 

 Anyone have rememdies for these fears?"
"Everytime I find people with same interests (for example, meet them through an online game), I can have a good time, but it gets to a point where it’s too much emotions to bear and I want to leave everything. Does anyone relate in some way?"
"Let me start out by saying I (F26) didn’t start driving until a little later than most. I got my permit at 18 and my driver’s license by 19. I’ve been driving for roughly 7 years now, and have always, to some degree, struggled with anxiety while driving.
 

 I always stick to back roads, and even familiar routes sometimes cause moments where I’m close to having a panic attack, although, that’s gotten easier for the most part. I do still struggle a lot with heavy traffic, three lane roads, and highways (specifically with changing lanes, merging, and getting off exit ramps) to the point where I do have full blown panic attacks, because I simply haven’t had the opportunity or support to drive in those areas or on longer trips. My mom (who also has severe driving anxiety) taught me how to drive and we would avoid those areas altogether.
 

 I’ve come to the realization recently that I’d like to move to a bigger city with my partner, and take more opportunities to travel. With this in mind, I realize that I have no choice but to work up to facing my biggest fears of driving in order to achieve my goals and pursue the life I want.
 

 I’ve made an anxiety ladder for exposure therapy, but no one seems to want to go with me on my first few steps to overcome my fear. I feel like the moral support would help, but my partner gets motion sickness, as do my parents, and my friends are all too busy / have different schedules and may not be able to go with me. Does anyone have tips on how to tackle this journey alone? I don’t want my fear to keep holding me back."
"Ever since I (28F) was a child, I remember being anxious most of the time. Most of my childhood memories are filled with anxiety - being scared, having anxious thoughts, jumping to extreme conclusions, etc. I realised that the state of being jittery and the constant inner turmoil are not the normal state to be in when I was only 24 and it opened a whole lot of different perspectives for me. 
 

 Have some of you been always anxious? Are some people genetically predisposed to have anxiety?

"My (27F) earliest memory of getting anxious over something repetitious was in middle school maybe? In my school's band class, the director often had us repeat the same measure of music over and over again until we could get it right. Something about the feeling of the keys on my fingers, hearing the same measure aloud, and being trapped inside a repetitious loop made me feel so anxious it was unbearable. It's a very physical, body-directed anxiety, but I'm not sure if it comes from the repetition itself or the repetitious body movement. The feeling of physical discomfort and anxiety remains even after the repetition stops.
 

 I still get this feeling now, though I don't find it to be super debilitating because not often are you faced with situations like this. For example, having to go through a repetitious task on my computer where I'm clicking the track pad in the same way causes me to hyperfocus on the sensations in my fingers and I clam up and everything feels unbearable. 
 

 Also, unrelated to repetition, I feel uncomfortable when hard parts of my body (i.e., bones) touch each other (though, it can be between me and someone else also like when cuddling). My husband and I laugh at this a lot, but it's something that seriously causes me physical discomfort and anxiety. I've brought this up with therapists before, but I haven't gotten any answers or ways to successfully deal with this. 
 

 Today, I did EMDR with my current therapist, and the rapid eye movement arguably brought up way more anxiety and discomfort for me than the memory itself. My vision was going spotty and I felt like I was going to have a panic attack from having to think about something traumatic while also moving my eyes back and forth. This was about an hour ago, but physically my body is still really tense and I'm panicky.
 

 I feel emotionally drained, so I'm sorry if this post is really short as usually I like to provide more background/details. Can anyone else relate to this? I've recently been diagnosed with ADHD. Could this be something related to that/other development disorders? The closest thing I've found to helping me describe this feeling is Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD), but I know self diagnosing isn't helpful a lot of the time. Thank you."
"I have just recently been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I am currently living at home and have been having a lot of trouble with getting a hold of my anxiety. I just started seeing a therapist about 3 weeks ago. I feel like my anxiety is circled around death and that gives me major health anxiety. I had my first panic attack last year in august and ever since then everyday is an uphill battle with my anxiety. 
 

 My mother asks me how I’m doin with the anxiety but if she gets a response that isn’t either a positive one or a very unspecified and undetailed response she gets angry with me. 
 

 I love my mom and I want to be able to express myself freely. I completely understand that it’s hard to hear your child going through hard things but as the actual person going through the emotions it really hurts me even more to feel like I just can’t be honest or open with her. 
 

 She tells me to stop and not think the way I do but if I could stop it that easily I definitely would. 
 

 Being me and living this new anxious daily existence is hard enough."
"Day before yesterday I got into a fight with my boyfriend which triggered my anxiety so much so that I felt I hit rock bottom. It made me realise how much I need to introspect and change certain aspects of my life for the best. I am hopefully starting therapy today onwards and honestly I am at that place where it is tough for me to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Everything seems so scary. I feel like I am one trigger event away from losing everything that matters to me, which is why I am seeking help today onwards. I did make some concrete changes today and I am counting it as day one towards making new changes in my life. It does seem scary and overwhelming but I know if I end up doing all of these things I have charted out for myself today, I will come out slightly happier than yesterday. 
 

 What would you advice for getting started? For wanting to be better and have this new beginning?"

"I'm 25 years old guy and anytime i try to talk to a stranger or under any slight pressure my voice gets shaky and i become incoherent. It's affecting my social life and most especially my self esteem.
 

 It was not as bad as this before but now it has getting worse. I can't even strike a conversation with a stranger without getting worried that i will probably embarrass myself. There's nothing i have not tried aside drugs. Currently, i have no Social life whatsoever. No gf, I have never even approach a girl in my life although i have been in a relationship. It all Started from being friends and the girls made the move.
 

 Recently, i was at a job interview and i ruin it all because i sounded as though I want to cry. The interviewer kept asking if i was okay. Then she said she doesn't think i will be able to cope with the job.
 

 Please, this is ruining my life and most especially my self esteem. I really need help as I'm already getting tired and feeling kind of suicidal. What can i do or is there any medication i can take to have it under control?"
"28f and last week I went into my local vets and spoke with a young pretty women around my age whos a vet nurse .... she was that anxious talking with me while filling in the forms that her hands were shakey.... 
 I cant tell if thats mere social anxiety or
 something more ?..
 

 I also finally found her fb as we have mutual friends :) 
 

 So she's been in this job 9 months so doesn't seem that new to this job?
 

 So not sure why she was so anxious
 Am I intimidating or was I purely job jitters?? 
 

 Also, it looks like shes kinda up there like she is the senior guide of this horse club and also has made some mean as techno songs that have been aired on George Fm 🔥 
 

 I also found out her sister is a top artist songwriter and vocalist ( the person who I have listened to a LOT in the past)!!! 
 

 So this chick seems to be popular and out there with producing in front of people so why would she be that anxious around me? 
 

 My mother met her a month ago when she took our old cat in and she didn't think this chick was that anxious but she did relay she noticed her apologize a bit and get the name wrong of our cat...
 

 So should I ask for her number or add her on Facebook after seeing her tomorrow expressing how I noticed we have mutual friends and find her to be really cool cute chick?"
JUST HURRY TF UP!!
"I'm 25. Have had anxiety ever since middle school. Started off only when in social situations, but got worse thru the years and is now present in all aspects of my life. I tend to overthink and ruminate(worst case all the time type of thinking) about things a lot. Recently got diagnosed with pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome. My blood pressure is also higher than normal. I know consistently being in fight or flight mode and having that much cortisol is no bueno for my body. I'm ready to fight my anxiety and get help. 
 

 What should I do from here? Seek a therapist? I would prefer to not take medications if at all able. I have a pilot's license that would potentially disqualify me from flying if diagnosed/on SSRIs. 
 

 Thanks!"

"Whenever I feel angry I just tend to lose control. And I tend to get angry when I think I am losing control. I get anxious and see red everywhere, hurt at times. I feel like running away from everything. I know running away is not the solution. Sure it seems easier but it is running away from my problems and in the end it is only going to hurt me. Not everything needs to be responded to. Sometimes just deep breathing and calming yourself will help. My mother taught me that shouting is the solution to everything, getting angry is the solution to everything. But the sane part in me suggest that calming yourself at that moment, learning about how that situation makes you feel and the reacting in a calm tone will help to resolve the issue. You do not have to be the victim every time. You need to find concrete solutions to problems. Write down your problems. My problem here is both my parents did something without asking me related to my life and that made me angry, but I do not know why. Why am I feeling this way? Is it because they went behind my back? Is it because I feel like they are controlling me, creating an uncertainty for me? I am going to talk to them about this and make them understand how them doing this makes me anxious. Just ask me rather the next time so I feel a part of it. Even if I were to do the same thing. I know they were only trying to be helpful but making me feeling involved would solve a lot of the issues for me some which I am aware of and some not. At the end of the day I just want to live a peaceful life and have a calm day. Where I donot have outbursts and if somebody else does, I hope it doesn’t affect my day and mood. I am trying to build myself from scratch and it is only going to take a lot of patience and resilience at my end."
Anyone that's currently on or has taken a benzo (xanax and valium) how do you feel after taking them? Do you recommend them? I'm considering talking to my doctor about them.
"I (27f) work as an engineer in a corporate office, I also sometimes go service customers to help them run our product.
 

 I have experienced SA my whole life and I have come so far already, but it doesn’t feel like it’s enough. 
 

 I will lead about 2 meetings a week and sometimes I get so stressed about them that I pretty much do nothing the whole day leading up to the meeting. I just sit there and overthink and overthink and overthink. Does anyone have advice in overcoming this?"

"All my life I have blushed having intense emotions, when I laugh very hard, when I cry, feel embarrassed, etc... But it has been worse since I have had to interact with my husband's partners. I feel more anxious in social situations and they constantly make fun of me when I am blush.
 They always think I'm shy, but I'm not really shy, when I'm comfortable talking to one person and not in a group, I never blush. 
 If they would take the time to get to know me they would know that I am a fun person and that I love to talk.And that being blushed is something I can't control.
 

 At dinner yesterday, one of them made a comment about the food and then pointed at me ""well, we already knew that *my husband's name* has bad taste"" and I am just overanalyze that he meant that he dislikes me because I blush."
"Does anyone else’s face tingle slightly if you’re anxious or in a tough mental spot? I was doing well for a few months and now the past 3-4 days have been tough. So frustrating. I just want to make sure this is just my anxiety, everything else in my body feels fine."
"For me, I simply never learned to properly socialize like everyone else. I experienced childhood trauma which left me without my parents or siblings at age 9. My childhood trauma was left untreated and I essentially grew up with depression and anxiety for my entire life. I did not have loving caring parents anymore. I grew up with a very restrictive immigrant family who were extremely nosy with my friends and made it difficult for me to have a social life. They themselves were also not social. So as a result, I ended up growing up very lonely being stuck in my room all day. 
 

 Put all of that together, and you get a guy who grew up most of his life living in fear with no one to talk to. I'm become very asocial and my anxiety makes it worse. I simply don't know how to properly manage a normal social life."

So I have a bachelor in Psychology. It is all cool and stuff but now I get comments from others that it is SO ironic that I studied psychology but have mental health problems. Also I have also been asked to psychologically evaluate them...like wtf I am not even a full psychologist I only have a bachelor.. And apparently I should be able to fix myself from my mental health problems....like they make me feel like a failure that I have anxiety....like i shouldnt have it..

"So I study at uni, I'm 25 because I basically skipped 3 years. I follow classes alone, and in this particular class I noticed this girl asking her friends (loud group, but not harmful or bullies) for a charger. I stepped out of my comfort zone and I told her I have a power bank and she used it. I don't know her name, I was too afraid to ask.

 I was thinking though, maybe this is my chance of making friends with the group and having actual friends in uni. I don't have friends at 25 and I want to get out of my shell. I'm also scared of looking clingy\\look like I'm hitting on the girl, so what do I say next time I encounter them? With covid still present, should I ask if I can sit with them? How do I approach the girl again if I don't even know her name? I'm so anxious..."
"TW: I discuss health/heart/diet/doctor issues. So if any of that might be too much for you than you might want to skip over this post. 
 

 A year ago I (27F) had some weird health issues start. At first, it was just a few missed periods. (I got diagnosed with PCOS.) But then weird stomach issues started too. (Still no diagnosis for that.) However during this time I saw a new primary care doctor and he wasn't helpful at all. 
 

 He said my cholesterol was ""dangerously high"" and he used the phrase ""you're literally sick and need to take this seriously"". It was 211, should be 200. I'm not sure how high the scale goes but I do know a lot of people in my family have it in the high 230s and are fine. I don't know why it's so high because I don't eat much meat, only chicken or turkey, I only use olive oil, I don't eat fried foods, etc. So the only thing I could do was cut out dairy. But the doctor called me a liar and said I must not be eating right. He made me keep a food journal but still didn't believe me. So I never got real advice because the advice he gave was based on him assuming I was lying and giving the advice based on what he thought was true. So I've just been walking around hoping not drinking milk anymore is enough to stop me from dying. I've had anxiety every time I eat since that day. 
 

 The doctor also told me anxiety can kill me and I needed to see a heart specialist right away because of it. He said something about anxiety giving you ""broken heart disease"". But until he said all this my anxiety was under control. I saw a psychiatrist for 15 years and only stopped because she said I was okay. 
 

 I was working out hard for two hours a day, 5 days a week. It made me feel better because I felt like tons of exercise would keep my heart going. But then I found out that over-exercising is really bad for PCOS and I had to cut it down to just light walking. So now I'm worried my heart is going to stop. 
 

 So yesterday my arm felt tingly and sore. I know your arm going numb is a sign of a heart attack. So I freaked out. This morning at 4am I woke up convinced my heart was beating funny. I don't know if it actually is or if it's all in my head. Or maybe it really is but just because I'm freaking out. Also, to make things worse, sometimes my stomach issues are a little higher up in my stomach and so it feels like it's my heart but it's really my stomach issues. When this all started a year ago I went to the hospital thinking my heart was beating funny, they gave me an EKG and said it looked fine. They gave me an Ativan that did nothing. Judged me a whole lot. And sent me home. My fiancé says he thinks I banged/hurt my arms somehow yesterday and that the heart issues are the same as last time (a combination of anxiety and the stomach issues). But like what if he's wrong and I'm actually dying?? I can't go back to the hospital because they'll just be annoyed with me again. 
 

 So yeah, it's almost 8am, I've been up since 4am thinking I'm dying. My arm still feels a little weird but better than yesterday. My heart issues (or the heart issues I just think I'm having) are the same as they were at 4am. 
 

 I just wish I could find a doctor who really listened to me and believed me and helped me. But I don't think they exist."

"I’ve(26f) struggled with anxiety/depression since I was 10-11. The last 2 years have been great for me as I have started to really get to the root cause of my issues and started actively working towards living a fulfilling life while dealing with my anxiety. I thought I was doing really well, but 2 nights ago I had a panic attack that woke me up out of my sleep. I called my mom at 4am, thinking I was dying. I was very close to calling 911 because I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack. Ever since then I feel like there’s a dark cloud over my head. I feel like I’m constantly on the verge of tears and I feel so uneasy. 
 

 Has anyone else had problems like this? I’m not sure what triggered the attack since I was sleeping. I’m also worried that it will happen again."
"Autistic 26M here. I recently asked out a woman on a date who turned out to have clinical social anxiety. She actually knew who I was despite me having absolutely no recollection of who she was. According to her, we apparently met in 2017. We had a 45 minute conversation in the park on a range of things - our mutual interests in rock music, her interest in paganism, her guitar playing, the neighbourhood she lives in that she hates, what she was studying and where she was working. I eventually asked her out on a date to a bar the following week which she enthusiastically agreed to. She seemed to be slightly nervous, stuttered a lot, asked me to repeat some sentences she couldn't comprehend but was very engaged and enthusiastic and seemed astounded that I knew about the necklaces she was wearing (an Egyptian ankh and a Celtic triquetra). She said that she was grateful that she could acquaint herself with someone who knew a great deal about music.
 

 At around 2.00 the following morning I received an FB messenger request from what turned out to be her sole best friend. He asked me a bunch of vague questions about whether I knew her, whether I hung out with her and what was my relationship with her. He then claimed that he was a nice guy who was an ex boyfriend and ex colleague of hers who used to work at Taco Bell with her. He noted that she mentioned me to her numerous times (after we met and the years before). He then requested to call me via the messenger app which I agreed to. He went on to \[reluctantly\] explain that she suffers from clinical social anxiety and has the inability to verbalize 'no' to strangers and it's for this very reason that she doesn't have any friends besides him and can only befriend people within her academic courses and workplace. He told me the likelihood of her meeting up with me at the bar next week at the time we both agreed to is nil since she ghosts and flakes on people without notifying them due to her social anxiety. He went onto rationalize his unsolicited messaging of me as justified because he is ""her only friend"" and she doesn't reveal details about herself easily hence why he needed to contact me in the first place. I was very suspicious of him from right of the bat, supposing that he might either be a stalker or an overprotective ex boyfriend.
 

 I called her up the following afternoon through my landline since I was confused about her contact details - I received responses to my texts to her confirming that day, time and venue from an email address which obviously wasn't the number she gave me before we left. She told me over the phone that she was grateful in the first place and her sole best friend had no malicious intentions in contacting me in the first place. She clarified to me that she wasn't looking to date anyone and she was under the impression that she agreed to a casual, platonic hangout with me. It seemed we had different ideas about what a date was suppose to be since the dates I had been going on tend to be very casual and low-key. I was of the impression she agreed to a date because I asked her whether she was in any relationship(s) or dating prior to requesting her contact details to arrange for a date. She said that she was happy being friends and I accepted that possibility. I proceeded to ask her questions regarding whether she thinks this ex/friend of hers has the right to speak for her regarding her own social anxiety, which she gave a vague answer to. I explained to her what I meant by 'manipulator' since she couldn't comprehend what I meant by that, since I affirmed to her that I was of the impression that he was an overprotective, stalking ex out to sabotage her from forming any sexual/romantic relationships with other people. I then affirmed to her that I do not want hear from her friend from this point onward and any sort of relationship we consent to should be between with no intervention from him.
 

 Not long after that phone conversation I received a message from her ex/friend claiming that I was scaring and harassing her and I should stop or else he will ""take action"". I then insisted that I was wanting to hear ""straight from the horse's mouth"" regarding her social anxiety. He then claimed she blocked my number for good reason and I rationalized my phone conversation with her as legit because of the two different contact details I received from her. I then told him I have no time and patience for mental gymnastics with him and then proceeded to withdraw. I decided to distance myself from her because of his BS.

"Does anyone experience a bounding pulse randomly and out of no where that sometimes lasts forever? I’ve had a full cardiac work up basically and everything has always come back fine, and I just have such a hard time accepting that it’s anxiety. 
 

 Also, for those who wear an Apple Watch, what is your usual HRV &amp; what’s your age? If you don’t care to answer. Mine is so low, that it’s just another thing that makes me anxious."
"Time is ticking, I am 29 yr female. I always wanted to have a family and kids, but my SA got worse since my 6yr boyfriend and I broke up on October. My nervous system is getting even more out of control and I have been having pretty bad life episodes bc of this. I can’t even eat in front of coworkers and always make an excuse to go home. It’s too draining. Just want to lie down in bed after these events. So my “future/present wishes” are contradictory. Does anyone relate? Any inspirations out there?"
"So dr says I am healthy but my systolic bp apparently rises due to anxiety, I've had 2 ekgs both good heart sounds good , of course kinda under the weather due to allergies and it socks being asthmatic but recently my top number has been kinda high at times bottom number still safe number heart rate is safe just my top number any tips. I dip tobacco and consume caffeine as well. I've heard that can make things worse"
"Hi, I'm looking for any advice for going back to school as an adult. I'm 29 and the process completely overwhelms me. From the very start with admissions and choosing classes. Paying???? Physically going to colleges for academic counseling and orientation. Ofc other students but I fear the teachers the most (traumatic experiences throughout school). Hearing people talk about open discussion classes immediately makes my chest tight, I couldn't even imagine having to do a public speaking class. Can you get around participation grades? It's gotten to the point where watching shows that show classroom participation give me anxiety. The more I've waited for the right time to go back the worse my anxiety around it gets. 
 

 Last time I tried I feel like I misunderstood or overthought the assignment and I just stopped going. The faces students were making made me feel like I was a tryhard idiot. (It was a ficken PowerPoint presentation for christs sake!) I wasted $2000 of someone else's money. 
 

 So any advice? Are professors any more aware of students with classroom anxiety or am I going to get yelled at or laughed at for freezing up whenever I'm put on the spot? How do you get more confident with your opinions and answers? 🙏🙏🙏"

"I'm 27 and have had social anxiety for over 10 years. I've coped by having a career In a field where I hardly need to interact with people and I'm afraid this may have made it worse. I'm taking some time off and went to visit my mom grandma and dad. Today we went to a restraunt that was unbelievably packed the tables were all close to each other we ate out side and it was so loud and hot. My heart started thundering in my chest I start hyperventilating, shaking uncontrollably and crying. My mom noticed right away and got me out of there. My family was supportive and great but I feel terrible that they had to leave the restraunt because of me. Social anxiety sucks. I can usually cope pretty well but this time it just overwhelmed me so quickly I couldn't even react. Sorry for rambling. I hope yall have a wonderful day."
I just feel really down today. I feel like this most of the time and I don’t have anyone to talk to. But on some days I feel really alone and I really wish I had someone I could confide in. My social anxiety prevents me from interacting with people and making new friends so I guess I’m stuck in this depressive cycle

"I am 28 years old and over the past few years I always had and still have this internal fight, like having two different personalities. One of them is sympathetic and caring. This side feels guilty for the way I act and behave and wants the help. Then, the opposite side creeps in and I convince myself I’m being a baby and that I am weak as a man. 
 

 Often I lay in bed with racing thoughts of my wife dying in a car crash on her way to work and I feel guilty for not spending more time with her during the day. My palms begin to sweat, my heart races and I feel worthless and helpless. The more I lay there the more graphic and intense the thoughts get. I see myself as the police knock on my door to tell me the love of my life is gone forever. Eventually I just get up and watch YouTube until I pass out. I wake up the following day and I am disgusted with myself. “How could you be so weak or dumb to think that.” Then maybe a few days later another thought creeps in manifesting yet again into a livable nightmare.  
 

 The more I think about it, I remember having these bouts as a child. Scared to death at night unless I checked, double and triple checked the doors that they were locked to ensure no one would kill us in the night. While I don’t worry as much about that anymore other thoughts have replaced that. 
 

 If it’s not the intrusive thoughts, it’s the sudden outburst of anger for no apparent reason. Followed by embarrassment for acting like a child. It’s the sudden love for something followed by dislike and boredom. It’s the life is great then life is boring and worthless. It’s the feeling of being so overwhelmed I shut down and just keep to myself. 
 

 I finally asked for help and have an appointment with a psychologist. However, I still have this fear that I’m just being dramatic and weak. This is also the first time I have ever wrote this out and it kinda felt good."
"I have anxiety when it comes to pretty much anything and I absolutely hate driving. I never wanted to learn how to drive but my parents basically forced me to take lessons when I was 17. I thought I’d be fine once I passed my driving test and got my licence; but I was so wrong. My dad got me my first car a couple of years after I passed my driving test. It’s not that I can’t drive, it’s just that I hate it. I panic a lot and dread roundabouts and ring roads, like they really scare me. 
 

 My dad has recently been driving me to work until I got my car insurance sorted out (a different story). Now from tomorrow I’m gonna have to drive myself to work and I’m dreading it because there are like atleast 3 ring roads on the way and I feel like I will have a panic attack (which is something I suffer from regularly). My parents just think that I’m a coward and I need to get over it. I’ve been trying to ‘get over it’ for so long but I don’t know what to do"
"So I've been driving for the past almost 2 years. A few months after getting my license, I got in a string of two minor accidents. The first one, I failed to slow down enough at a stop sign, and bumped the back of the car in front of me. The second one, a few months later, I was merging onto the road from a gas station parking lot, and even though I checked my surroundings, didn't notice a car that was merging from a road that was out of my view. The sides of our cars scuffed. With accident forgiveness, my insurance was roughly $215 a month.
 

 I went from January 2021 to January 2022 with zero accidents. Just a few days ago, I stopped at a Krispy Kreme, and parked my car in a spot where you have to back up to get out. Before I backed out, I checked my mirrors, physically turned around and looked behind me, and slowly backed out. Ended up bumping into someone's BMW that must have pulled up behind me after I got in the car. They were completely in my blind spot, my vehicle was a bit taller. The driver was nice about it, and the cop was saying the damage was so minor they really didn't need to file a claim, but she wanted to file anyway.
 

 So now I'm expecting my insurance to be $300 a month or something. My rate will obviously go down around the beginning of 2024, when the first/second accidents fall off my record, but I feel really bad. I've learned to avoid the same mistakes that led to my first two accidents, and I can drive in morning/night/rain/etc pretty confidently. I just feel like now I won't really afford to move out of my parent's place until my insurance cost goes down. My two younger siblings have been out of the house for years and I'm almost 25 and still stuck here. I guess some people are late bloomers, but I always feel like I'm falling behind.
 

 Is there anything I can do to help lower the rate? Or do I really just have to suck it up for the next year and a half, and put my life on hold until I'm 26 and a half? I'm planning to take a defensive driving course, so that should help me out a little, but I hate that such an easily avoidable situation might have screwed me over."
"If you do, do you monitor your HRV on it? If so, what does yours typically run? I’m 27f and mine sometimes gets as low as 12ms and averages to about 30 ms a day which I know is low for me. 
 

 But I’ve also had so many tests done on my heart and everything has been coming back fine. 
 

 Is it really just anxiety causing this? 
 Is it the same for you? 
 Thank you."
"Because that's me today and a bunch of other days too.  
 

 I'm 27 and have never been in a relationship. I've had sex basically once because all the other times went wrong. 
 

 I still live at home because all my attempts to move out of state failed (anxiety). Now I'm trying to find a place close to home. Who knows if that'll work.
 

 I have no expectations because I'm almost always disappointed when it comes to things like this.
 

 I just can't get it together.
 

 My career of choice is entertainment because I'm a great singer but I'm terrified of stages so that's great.
 

 I'm literally built against myself. A whole ass contradiction.

I (25f) have declined every parttime job ive applied for bc i cant get over the social anxiety and gernal anxiety. HELP! anxiety has ruined my life. Never had a part time job outside of the family home bc of it
I am trying to schedule my weekly therapy session tomorrow but until then I am just high on hormones (periods) and unable to deal with my anxiety. My thoughts feel like they are all over the place and I want to be able to manage them someway without writing them in a journal because I can't deal with any thoughts right now.
"I'm seeing a psychiatrist in a week for the first time to see if meds may be the right choice for me. I'm super worried about a couple of the side effects I've seen listed (especially weight gain and low libido--both of those side effects just sound like a bummer to me, especially the first one because I'm already a bit overweight and trying to lose weight for my health, not gain it). 
 

 But another thing I've noticed when researching is that it seems like almost every anti-anxiety medication shouldn't be combined with alcohol. I don't drink a massive amount, maybe 3 drinks a week and only one drink at a time. However, one of my hobbies that brings me a lot of joy is brewing my own beer at home. I would hate to give that hobby up, or even to continue brewing but never being able to drink the fruits of my labor. Or brewing kombucha, which has been suggested to me but definitely doesn't seem as fun. 
 

 So, are there any anti-anxiety meds you readers know of that do not interact with alcohol? Like I said, I don't want to drink often, I just want to continue with my hobby that brings a lot of fun and creativity into my life. If that's not an option, I'd like to know so I can make a decision about where to go from here. And before anyone suggests it, I'll be sure to ask my psychiatrist this question as well and hear his thoughts."
"I (30m) met a girl I really like (29f)

"Hi I'm a 26f - I've had severe driving anxiety from the jump. I did regular driving school but it was like a decade ago. 
 

 I have no choice but to drive now as I am pregnant and need to be able to get my child around 
 

 Where I live public transit is a joke and incredibly unsafe, my partner refuses to drive us around.  
 

 Basically I am seeking advice on how to learn again. Are there classes adults can take? I don't know where to start and I am so overwhelmed :("
"About a month and a half ago, my boyfriend of 6+ years admitted to me that he had started taking antidepressants 2 weeks prior (without telling me) and that we need to take a break so that he can fully adjust to the medications. He assured me that this was the only reason for the break and that A) no other problems in our relationship prompted this, and B) he's not interested in seeing/hooking up with other people. We did not set an end date since the adjustment period for antidepressants can vary so widely, but he also told me that he didn't know how he wanted to proceed with our relationship after the break.
 

 I really *really* want to trust that he's doing this for his own health and nothing else. I really want to trust that he has the best intentions for both of us. My anxiety during the this time is flying out of control though and I'm finding it really hard to block intrusive thoughts and to not be reactive to them. 
 

 There are so many negative scenarios flying through my brain... what if it's deeper than the medication? What if this is just a cowardly way of breaking up with me? what if he's cheating? What if he never loved me or was never attracted to me at all? What if I was only lovable to him because he was so depressed? I don't necessarily believe any of these things are true and I really am trying to shut out or reroute these thoughts. Every time they creep up, though, it wears on me even more and I feel like my thoughts are growing more and more convincing.
 

 I'm really scared. I don't want to spiral out of control and end up jumping to conclusions, doing something drastic, pushing him away, etc. I would appreciate any advice on how to shut out/reroute intrusive thoughts, or just in general any opinions on the situation overall."
"I think I've had some sort of social anxiety since I was in elementary school. I never had a lot of friends back in my younger days. The ""friends"" I had all came and went. I was more used to being alone. I'd usually just sit somewhere quietly and just wanted to go home. Sometimes I'd just end up playing by myself and other times I played with other kids but most of the time I indeed played by myself. It kinda went like that through middle school and into my teen years too. Friends came and went. I never really made any attempt to establish any kind of friendship or connection with anyone. I became an awkward mess in high school. My classmates were growing up and maturing as the years went by but here I stayed the same...."

I just had my 6 monthly appraisal where my boss basically checks on how I'm doing in the job. I've kept the same one day a week job for a long time, and this was the first time I felt called out on it. Normally it's just a check in scenario, see how I'm coping, let me know of any new changes to the workplace etc. This time, however, my boss made it clear that they were concerned I wasn't trying to 'step up the ladder' in the library workplace, as in, trying to apply for more senior roles or roles with more workdays. 
 

 The truth is, I've been working through my deep seated SA issues for a long time, and my one day of work suits me because I work alone, albeit I do see a lot of customers (which I'm fine with as they're usually quick exchanges). As such, I feel less pressure to socialise with other colleagues and potentially feel anxiety. I do relief work for other libraries from time to time, where I can socialise with colleagues, but it's rare enough that I don't feel pressured to see them everyday and feel anxious all the time. 
 

 I keep my SA private, never have I discussed it with colleagues, though by now I'm sure they're aware that I'm not the most socially confident individual. I think I have kept it to myself because I just wanted to try and fit in without having to feel different, plus I hate any kind of awkward attention on myself. Basically, I just didn't want to feel singled out or weird, which I have experienced throughout my life. I am good in one to one scenarios, I just struggle to be assertive in social situations and can be reserved due to my anxiety and certain lifestyle choices. I do feel that my boss was suggesting that I wasn't bringing much to the table of trying to commit or contribute to the library service, and that I seemed to have lost interest in the job. I felt very emotional but tried my best to keep it inside, as there was another staff member in the meeting and I just didn't want to feel vulnerable. Though I could feel the tears glazing over my eyes. Without trying to be too prying, she essentially wanted to know what I planned to do career wise, and said she felt I was stalling. 
 

 The truth is, it's hard to contribute much when you're only working one day a week generally, so not sure what more she expects of me without me being paid extra. But I think the thing that got me was that I couldn't justify easily in her eyes why I never go up for any bigger roles within the library service, and I know behind my back they talk amongst themselves and consider me a bit of an outsider. I've even had other more dominant, assertive personality workers casually question why I don't go for jobs in the library with more hours, because they tell me the days I do probably aren't enough to support me financially. I always try and make up some excuse but end up feeling red faced. 
 

 I prefer to keep my SA struggles and other personal problems like slight depression away from work, as I don't feel comfortable discussing it with other colleagues, who are much more outgoing than I. But it makes it so hard to explain why I have stayed in the same lower tier job for so long. The truth is, it works for my personal situation right now, and it truly felt horrible having to be confronted. It allows me a certain amount of income, a chance to get out of the house, serve customers which I actually find pleasant, and plenty of time to work on my writing work. Also, I get a bit of negativity from some family members, who themselves work full time and see me as a bit of a 'waster', or lazy and get annoyed that I work so little. But believe me, its not laziness, just anxiety. I currently live with my mother and I think other family members also get annoyed as they consider me to be 'mooching' off her and not paying my way. I try my best to contribute to the finances of the house and I am working towards moving out once I get my freelance writing going, but right now, that's all I'm seen as and it's incredibly hurtful. I just hate the way no one seems to appreciate what I'm going through, and how, I desperately want my financial and personal independance, but I'm trying to achieve it without putting myself through anymore anxiety or pain. I've felt it day in, day out for years and I just want to make things a bit more bearable for myself. 
 

 Tbh I'm not desperate for advice, though if you have some that's lovely. I just think I wanted to vent my frustrations and sadness as I've just got home and felt very emotional. Also, I don't feel I have anybody I can easily talk about this to so sometimes an online vent is the next best option :)"
"My (25f) boyfriend (25m) and I have been dating almost 5 years and overall we have a great, healthy relationship. However, I am constantly thinking about all of our problems 24/7. When I’m with him usually I feel so happy and on top of the world but when I’m alone I convince myself our problems are too much to handle and we need to break up. I’m not sure if this is anxiety or maybe we are just not compatible. I have been told I have a lot of anxiety by a counselor a long time ago but I haven’t been to counseling in a long time. 
 

 Our main issue is that he smokes weed 2-3 times a day. He cannot handle an ounce of stress without getting high. I find myself constantly worrying about future problems it may cause in our relationship or marriage. We argue about this topic fairly frequently. He has tried to smoke less frequently but it never lasts for long and then he returns to smoking his usual amount. Then I continue to have constant anxiety about our relationship and the cycle continues. 
 

 Anyway I am just looking for some advice on the situation. Am I overreacting to everything ? Is this my anxiety taking over? Is this issue not as big of a deal as I think? I would appreciate anyone’s thoughts."
I get feelings in the center of my chest below the sternum area like someone is poking me then all of a sudden it felt weird when inhaling then I felt faint and now I’m still having trouble inhaling and my heart rate is normal it’s like I’m not satisfied when inhaling and I have to take a deep breath which makes these feelings continue what is it
I just took 2 home covid tests and both are positive. I couldn't believe it when i saw the result of the first one so I wanted to take another to make sure. I feel really scared now and can't sleep. I feel guilty because I live with 4 other people and don't want them getting sick. I'm the first one in our house to get it which is surprising to me because I'm currently unemployed and barely leave the house. I keep reminding myself i'm 26 and healthy and everything is going to be fine. I feel particularly anxious at the moment because I really don't want to be alone now because I'm scared but I have to self isolate. My husband is sleeping in the guest room to be safe and I feel so guilty. It's 11pm right now and everyone is asleep. I keep thinking about how I'm going to tell everyone in the morning. I feel so bad. Any words of encouragement or comfort welcome!!
"So i have found a dent on my breast. I saw it last year paniked about it but never got it checked. I dunno why i think i forgot.. anyway a year later i had just been to the gyno and forgot to mention it. 
 

 I saw it again in the mirror at home and it freaked me out. I am so afraid i have had breast cancer since last year and that it is growing. I am 25 almost 26.. i feel i will be dead within the next few years...i know it is rare to have cancer at this age but honestly I have been seeing alot of young people getting cancer on yt these days... I hate myself for not getting it checked sooner.."
"I'm (29f) one of those cases where my only friend is my husband. I've always thought how lucky I am to have found each other, because having no friends made me also had no hope of getting married one day. LOL.
 

 Due to my husband's new job, I came to live in a new city, for me it was a new beginning butI have learned that I was looking for friendship with the wrong people, people who made me feel different and strange.
 

 I met these people at work, my social anxiety was extreme trying to talk to them, I always excluded me from having social interactions because I believed that it involve judge people and speak badly behind their backs, i hardly ever said anything until they reached my limit of talking about racism or people's appearance, a part of me I wanted to make an effort to be social and have friends avoiding participating in the topics that bothered me, but after each meeting I felt more and more sad spending time with them than being alone, I didn't like them, but for some reason felt like I wanted their approval.
 

 I felt so disillusioned, until at a random dinner in a restaurant, I met two very nice people, they are much more extroverts and sociable, but they make me feel like i can be myself! we can have such nice conversations and time goes by fast when i'm with them. I'm definitely not afraid to share my perspectives or be vulnerable. I think we are completely different people, but I love that we can learn things from each other.
 

 After having meetings with the first ones, I feel like I was wasting my time with the wrong people.I also learned that sometimes nothing is better than something in this case fake ""friends""."
"[SOLVED] So I'm quitting my 2nd job (I work 2 jobs) because I have gotten a raise in my primary job which should be enough to sustain me on its own. However the people on my second job are so kind and amazing and they are lacking people. I've never had to quit a job I've enjoyed before and I've only worked there for 6 months ish. Was thinking to say my primary job has given me an opportunity that I cannot decline as its very relevant to my education and future. But I still feel so bad as this will be a bit ""out of the blue"". I will still have to work 3 months tho so it's not like they get short on time to find someone new..."
"My friend wanted to hang out today and grab drinks but she’s told me she has a sore on her lip and says it’s a canker, but I know she has lots of unprotected sex. I’m worried she may accidentally drink from my cup without knowing and infect me. I know I sound like a bad friend but I have lots of anxiety and I don’t want to risk getting any disease or infecting my potential partner . Not sure if I’m over reacting"

"I'm 29 years old now and for all my life, i was avoidant, always pessimistic about what others think of me, and ashamed of my past and my behavior. We all know it too well.
 

 Only for the past year, i've tried - and it's been damn though and still is - to change the way i interact with people. I've opened up myself, passed my opinions, asked people out despite the fear of rejection, owned up to my mistakes and apologized to those i've hurt. 
 

 It's astonishing how well it is received and how it triggered a positive feedback loop of self-perception.
 

 I am fairly happy with myself now and all it took was to bring up the courage to express how i genuinely feel."
"I used to constantly blast music to avoid anxious thoughts and soothe myself. I believe it was my only coping mechanism because it helped me focus on something other than my interal turmoil.
 

 Anyone else?"
"Just wanted to know if anyone else has ever had these kind of issues. 
 

 I have got god awful posture! So I suffer with upper back pain from time to time. Day to day it has gotten better now I’ve lost weight and go to the gym as I do exercises for my upper back knowing my posture is terrible. I also try and maintain a good posture.
 

 From time to time, where I must start slouching and lounging around without noticing, all of a sudden I’ll get a pain in the mid top of my back and it’s horrible, almost like a trapped nerve but at the top of my back, sometimes the pain can be felt in my shoulder-blade and front of neck all at the same time where I obviously round my shoulders and look down at my phone or my head is just tilted down compared to my body when watching TV… It never fails to give me a bit of a fright every time it happens but once I get up and walk and correct my posture for a bit, the pain goes pretty damn quick! Which is fantastic but cos of my anxiety, it puts me on edge.
 

 Would be nice to know if anyone suffers with anything like this."
"Hi 
 Has anyone here ever worry so so so much it they have cancer that it takes over their life and can't be focused on anything but that? 
 I've become obsessed with every bowel movement wondering if what I am seeing is blood or not. I don't know forsure what I am seeing so I have googling nonstop trying to figure it out.
 

 Anyone ever go through something like this? Does anyone understand my deep concern and worry I have? Did you go to the dr to check it out or what did you do?
 

 I have gone to the dr over 30 times in the past 15 months so I am struggling to make an appointment for the millionth time.
 

 

 

 

 EDIT-
 Thank you guys so so much for all of your kind words and advice. I deeply appreciate it. ❤️ 
 It is so nice hearing from every one of you and it means a lot just to hear from people with similar difficulties and feelings as mine.
 I hope you all are doing well and your anxiety is calm today. It's a constant battle everyday but I'm taking one day at a time and I hope you guys are doing the same. ❤️"
"**EDIT: Due to some of the comments on this post, I want to iterate that my going to management was about stopping an insensitive kid from joking about suicide to the wrong person. My intent in doing what I did was not to ridicule or belittle this kid, or to bully him. The company is willing to give him a second chance, and I hope he learns from it.**
 

 CW: &gt;!suicide mention and mention of body image issues.!&lt;
 

 For context, I'm 28 (F). As I was leaving the gym on Tuesday, one of the guys behind the front desk asked me how old I was. I was put off by it, but I knew why he was asking, so I told him that I look younger than I actually am. He sort of made a stupid comment on it and I left hoping he wouldn't say anything more about it. Fast-forward to today: as I was leaving the gym, the very same guy at the front desk brings it up *again*, in front of a bunch of patrons and other employees. He implied he had made fun of how young I look to other staff members, and told me that he never would have guessed I was so old, that he knows people my age with ""lifestyles"" (house, kids, well-paying jobs, etc). He also told me that I don't dress my age or act my age. I told him that he's only ever seen me in my gym clothes (I work from home and it's not like I'm going to apply a full face of makeup to go to the gym), and we've talked all of twice, this being the second time. He went on for another few minutes, and for some reason he felt compelled to tell me not to go home and &gt;!kill myself!&lt; because of what he had said to me. When I told him that wasn't going to happen, he said that he could be my &gt;!""thirteenth reason""!&lt;. (I got the reference.)
 

 I hated to do it, but I flagged down another staff member whom I trust and told him what had happened. The staff member I spoke to was ""at a loss for words"", he was so appalled. I eventually just walked out to my car, and when I got home I started crying. I go to that gym in part because of my low self esteem and &gt;!poor body image. !&lt;I've made a few friends there and even work with a personal trainer there. Now it doesn't feel like a safe place anymore.
 

 Having a baby face costs me a lot of credibility and respect. I don't care how much I'll appreciate it when I'm older. People think they can push me around because I'm short and I'm quiet and I look like a kid. And there's nothing I can do about it. If you have a baby face or look younger than you actually are, my heart goes out to you."
"I (28F) had the flu all week and I've been quarantining in my office so I don't get my daughter and my husband sick. Every cough, sneeze, whine, etc. out of either of them would make me so worried they were going to get sick because of me.
 

 Yesterday, I decided to get up and try to get some normalcy by playing video games with friends. About 10 minutes in, I started feeling crummy with mild flu symptoms and realized if I wasn't better within the next 24 hours, I wouldn't be able to go on the trip.
 

 I got this feeling like my stomach inflated into my chest and like I was going to poop. At the same time, I got super dizzy and lightheaded and had intense tunnel vision, like I smoked about 100 hits too many of marijuana. This lasted about 20 seconds or so and I was good enough to lay down on the floor. It happened two more times over the next several minutes while I laid there and googled ""abdominal pressure and dizziness."" 
 

 The first thing that pops up is ""Call 911 if you think you're having a heart attack"" and that sold me, so I got up and drove myself to the ER around the corner. I had several more of those waves but each one was less intense then the last. I was super foggy and tachycardic, but my EKG was fine, and the weird pressure in my upper abdomen went away (after they gave me an Ativan and a Maalox cocktail). D dimer for clots came back fine, and no obvious issues with spleen/gallbladder/kidneys, etc.
 

 The doctor never said ""you were having a panic attack"" but the nurse chatted about how she gets through panic attacks while she was discharging me. They sent me home with a prescription for a couple Ativan, too.
 

 I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack or I threw a clot, it was the most uncomfortable and jarring and terrifying feeling. If this is what panic attacks feel like, I'm going to be panicked all the time that I'm going to have another.
 

 Anyway, I'm hoping others have relatable symptoms when they unfortunately have a panic attack, and that the panic attacks about having panic attacks eventually goes away."
Anyone else experience the lack of understanding of social cues? I just can’t get it and it’s messing with my life. I feel like I e messed up many opportunities with my lack of understanding.
"Hello everyone  
 I'm 26 years old, right before a long trip postponed by COVID. I have been dealing with anxiety for a few months and it worsened in the last few weeks. Mostly it's about my death or the death of my boyfriend (with whom im currently living).  
 This anxiety is crippling and pops up every time he leaves the house or I'm leaving him to meet my friends. Even when we're hanging out toghether im having thoughts about what if that's the last time or the last kiss. It's making it hard for me to enjoy the things we're doing together.  
 This big flight is a dream which I had for a long, long time, and in certain moments of clarity throught the day I know it's the right thing to do, but throughout big parts of the day i'm stressed about it.
 

 I know the best solution is psychological and/or medications, and recently I tried going through CBT for a couple of weeks, but the psychologist and I couldn't bond very well, i wasn't satisfied with the treatment and stopped going. in 2-3 months, after my return, I will resume the treatment with a different psychologist.  
 My boyfriend is sweet and supportive but the anxiety is overwhelming at times, and I would love to hear some tips or ways for dealing with these bouts of anxiety in the meantime of before the flight. 
 thank you!"
"I'm 28f and now I have my monthly and I have been in bed for 2 days due to some really weird stomach sensations...
 

 :(((
 

 I also always get constant pulsing (Vagus nerve), and tightbess in tummy every day for some years now and have some lower back pain!!! 
 

 Natural meds don't really reduce this shit 😒 
 

 Any help would be great as I am over this life"
"I (27f) have a date tomorrow with someone who i met on a dating app and he is driving up to me (he lives about an hour away) for a brunch “date” tomorrow morning. Thinking about it has me so anxious and ill. I’m feeling sick to my stomach and want to cancel, but don’t want to be rude. I haven’t dated much in my life and have never had a serious boyfriend. My anxiety always tells me I’ll never feel a connection with someone, or convinces me I’m not even attracted to them, or that I could never marry this person…..before I even MEET them. Does anyone have tips or good stories about pre-date anxiety that is now or did go well? Hoping I fall asleep and am not up with anxiety :/"
"Does anyone else here live vicariously through fictional characters and stories because of their social anxiety? Idk how to explain it that well but in my case I feel very attached to fictional characters and sometimes imagine that being like them must be nice because they experience so much and have people around that like them, things that I can't experience because of my social anxiety."
"As a kid, I literally used to shake whenever I need to talk to someone new or read infront of the whole fucking class and shit like that. I couldn't walk past anyone without knowing where to look or what to do, so I came up with this bizarre idea of ""vicious blinking,"" hoping that it would make me look a little busy and lost in my own world. It did help, like people started acting compassionate and showed a lot of sympathy ever since I started blinking like an idiot, perhaps it made me look innocent and helpless I guess. Now I'm 28 and can't get rid of the habit no matter how hard I try, WHATSOEVER. The habit kind of stuck with me for the past twenty years, and I don't think I'd ever be able to lose it. Besides, I'm worried that I would look super awkward if I stop my ""vicious blinking!"" And not to mention, I've a bad case of stuttering, and everytime I couldn't get a word out, I immediately start blinking to fill the awkward silence, which actually doesn't help in anyway at all. Is anyone's on the same boat as me -- coping mechanism gone wrong -- lol!"
"It has took me a long time to accept that I need help, and I think the time is now. I’ve never spoken to anyone about this, so I’m after some advice.
 

 I’m 25, and I have some disabilities… I’m deaf (wear hearing aids), I’m short-sighted (contacts), I have night blindness and I have a condition which affects my balance organs (I have no balance at all so I swagger around like a drunk person on the streets).
 

 When I was 16, I was walking home and met my mum in the street. She was clapping a dog, and as I have dogs at home, I wanted to see it. As I was clapping it, it tore a massive chunk of flesh out my leg. It took weeks of healing, cleaning, bandaging and I’m terrfied of passing dogs in the street now. That wasn’t the traumatic part for me, after the accident, the police put the dog to sleep. The owners became aggressive, and threatning. Whenever I’d go out with my friend, they’d pass me and threaten me, revv their car engine, shout names, one time the mum even went to chase me because I looked at her. She’d get her kids to stare at me, shout stuff.
 

 This went on for a year or so. It calmed down now that I’m older, they still stare. However, ever since then, I’ve always been afraid to leave my house. I never go out alone, unless it’s with my mum or friends (rare because they work) and I’m petrified and over-think everything and I don’t know where to start asking for help.
 

 Thanks."
"So I am currently so worried about having cancer. I think I have breast, ovary, cervical, or bowel cancer. I just cannot stop worrying. I have some cramps that started last month and frequent urge to pee. Ultrasound on abdomen found nothing wrong . Urine clear. I have a yeast infection tho. But all I can think of is cancer. I will see my gyno tomorrow. I cannot have pap smear or transvaginal ultrasound because my hymen is in the way. I will get it removed soon..but not fast enough i think. .. I am afraid she is missing something cause she cant get the full picture...I am only 25..unlikely but possible. :("

I was set to get my license this time around , my boyfriend helped me alot with the practice driving , in March I set up my driver test for May18 and I passed .. ( never thought that day would come 😂) don’t give up , y’all got this"
"So for a while I was mainly afraid of sudden causes of death such as blood clots, stroke, heart attack etc..
 

 But now I have sort of fallen into a cancer hole. I fear all types of cancer. How can I possibly screen for all of them. I am thinking of getting a colonoscopy and endoscopy. Brain mri seems a bit more difficult to get... It seems exhausting tho to get all these procedures although they would give me a peace of mind from those cancers atleast...
 

 So anyone know how to deal with it. Things that help you? I really dunno how to live properly right now. I feel I 100% have cancer although I am 25 and generally healthy.
 

 Edit: Thank you everyone of sharing your thoughts advice and experiences:) It has definitly helped me to get a different perspective and I hope others struggling have also benefited from this."
"Training for my new job starts tomorrow- this will be my first job since 2018! I have always had horrible work anxiety ever since I started working at 16, I'm 26 now and the fear hasn't gone anywhere. I really struggle and constantly have to battle with myself to turn up to shifts and not quit. I want this time to be different, I want to have a better experience of work going forward. I've been mentally preparing myself for weeks but I'm still very anxious. Determined, but anxious. 
 

 I think my anxiety with work comes from a place of feeling inadequate, like I'll mess something up, embarrass myself, have a panic attack, be judged. Plus just being surrounded by people and feeling stuck somewhere for an extended period of time. It's a casual weekend job while I get through the rest of my degree, but I really want to make the most of it and use this opportunity to develop a better relationship with work. It's a very similar role to the last job I had so at least it's somewhat familiar, I just don't want to get there tomorrow and crumble.
 

 If anybody has any tips or wise words other than ""go to therapy"" or ""try medication"" I could really use them! Those are great tips of course but I'm already on meds and I'm currently in the process of working up the courage to use the psych referral my doctor gave me. Some other advice or ideas of what you find helps with work anxiety would be great, please! I need all the wisdom I can get. Or even just some uplifting words of support and encouragement would be so helpful right now to help me stay centred and not spiral."
"Hey all, 
 

 I (26m) am well on my way to recovery from a tough chronic anxiety episode that started in September of last year. I've improved and slowly checked off top priority items like insomnia, brain fog, and the chronic actual anxiety from my list of problems. Seemingly, the last major hurdle is my muscle tension and I am trying to gain insight from anyone who has struggled and recovered or maybe at least has before. 
 

 Working with my therapist we decided a couple weeks ago that my muscle pain may not be anxiety related (since I've made a lot of improvement since say April 1). I have pain on one side, mostly, on my left. It's focused on my lower back, mid-back by shoulder blade, my left thigh down the outside and on the inside near my groin. Sometimes it's just achey, sometimes it's sharp. If I try to rollerblade (a new hobby) I can't go maybe a half hour before the pain in my hips make me want to or have to stop. This is where my right hip will also hurt in the same locations as the left. My left side always hurts and my right hip only joins in the fun if I rollerblade or try to mountain bike. I'm a strong biker and used to go 15 miles a day pretty easy. 
 

 Anyways, my therapist told me to talk to my doctor and I did so we tried a Prednisone taper and stretching. To be honest the Prednisone did seem to help initially with some of it and overall seems to have maybe helped with general fatigue I was still experiencing each day. But now the pain seems to be back and as bad as ever and I'm literally just finishing the Prednisone today. 
 

 I guess my question is, from people who know their muscle aches are anxiety related, does this sound similar at all? The pain location doesn't have to be the same. I know I'm still tense pretty often, especially when I'm stretching, but the pain can be either annoying or enough to stop me from doing the things I'm enjoying. I tend to think I have a high tolerance for pain as I've had 3rd degree burns, broken no less than 10 bones, among other things like shingles. Yet this is something that just keeps bothering me for months when I could tolerate the others. I had the tired arms and weak legs for a long while during the worst of the anxiety, those have improved a lot and are essentially gone. 
 

 Thanks!"
"Most of my days go like this. I live alone and I don't have many friends to talk to or spend time with. I don't really have any hobbies or activities I engage in. I too scared to go out and do things on my own. I cannot get the mental hurdle of going out and just meeting people on my own. My life is fairly simple and boring and I couldn't help but wonder if anyone else goes through this.
 

 Wake up, go to work, eat and drink throughout the day while working, finish work, pointlessly goof off with my phone, reddit, YouTube, and other pointless apps for the rest of the night, shower, go to sleep, and rinse and repeat. Anyone else relate to this?"
"So my (25f) fears are unfortunately things that are totally rational. My biggest fear is my mom dying. People die literally all the time and of course she eventually will. So I have no way to calm my anxiety about it because I can’t even tell myself “no you’re being crazy that’s ridiculous, that won’t happen”. I can’t tell myself there’s nothing to worry about because actually, there is. My other big fear is car accidents. (I’ve been in a few). It’s a completely rational fear because car accidents happen literally all the time, so it’s perfectly rational to imagine that I may get in one. I’ve been in them before. I see them every day on my commute to/from work. They’re a commonplace thing that can completely turn your life upside down in an instant and it terrifies me. How do I stop being anxious about things that are actually valid concerns?"
"I’m 25f and sometimes I feel like my body doesn’t know how to feel normal anymore. I don’t even remember what it feels like to think and feel like a normal person. I am always, and I mean ALWAYS, in some kind of pain, whether it’s my muscles or my stomach or my head or some other random body part. I’ve been to doctors and they all say that the pain is a physical manifestation of my anxiety. I guess that makes sense, since the only times I truly feel “normal” are when I’m distracted by something for an extended period of time, but even that is rare. 
 

 It’s almost as if a rare moment of calm is seen as a threat to my brain, so it makes me feel sick or in pain as a way of “filling in” that gap. My body has become so anxious and sensitive that every jolt of anxiety and twinge of pain feels magnified. 
 How are we supposed to get anything done when we feel this way all the time? Does anyone else experience this, and if so, have any tips on how to get over it?! I’m tired of feeling sick all the time"
"I'm lonely, unhappy generally, unhappy with my body, am nowhere with my career, not sure if it's what I really want to do anyway. I'm scared of change but know things need to change. I'm not even 30 yet and feel like a tired old man.
 

 

 So, yeah. Welcome to my party."

 My mother, father, and other brother don’t get it. Too confrontational, telling me to think about how good I have it, stop crying.
 Can’t see therapist until Friday.
 

 I don’t know what to do. I’m not well."

"So I have been feeling really anxious lately right after drinking alcohol like the small boxes of champagne or even a shot of vodka or tequila. I have noticed once I have that anxiety, I’ll take a hydroxyzine and the anxiety goes away almost instantly. Should I completely stop drinking or are there any ways to prevent anixety after drinking? I am 28 and I have been drinking for years.. this anxious feeling literally just started. Someone please help 🥺😔"
"I'm 27 F. I feel like nobody wants me around and I don't know what to do about it. 
 

 At home, I'm lonely. I stay in my room because I get exhausted quickly and often need plenty of rest. But that's not the only reason. Whenever I tried to spend time with my family they kept criticizing the way I am. They called me overweight and told me that I'm being a burden on them. They even compared me to a heavy bag and said nobody would want to carry me around. 
 

 For context, the comparison to the heavy bag is about my walking disability. I have Cerebral Palsy and I walk with a crutch, but I keep losing my balance so often that I need to hold someone's arm if I need to walk for a while. 
 

 I tried switching my mobility aid by trying a rollator instead of a crutch, but the doctor told me it was dangerous because it was even harder to keep my balance while using it. And if I use a wheelchair, it's a WW3 waiting to happen. My family thinks I'm being a burden out of laziness. They don't believe any of my struggles. And they refuse to help me when I ask for their help. They don't even take me outside with them unless it's a special occasion. 
 

 At achool, I'm lucky to have so many caring students and colleagues but I feel really bad about needing their help too. I get mad and upset at myself for not being able to go anywhere on my own. 
 

 Living like this every single day feels like a torture. I want to find somewhere I can belong. Somewhere I won't be seen as a burden. 
 

 I know I need to go somewhere else. I know this is incredibly bad. But unfortunately I don't have a way out. I don't have any support system and my country doesn't have any independent living options. Our laws require families to take care of their disabled relatives. 
 

 I'm making this post because I'm really tired of feeling trapped. I hope someone will be able to understand what I'm going through."

 Backstory: I have anxiety issues paired with codependency and yes I am seeking therapy before y'll start attacking me. I am going to talk about this in my therapy session today but until then I want to know how to deal with this.
 

 My (26M) boyfriend had gone on a work trip to another country for 10 days. Last night he returned and I went to the airport to receive him and we drove back to his place, where I stayed over. In the morning while he was browsing instagram randomly and we were seeing random videos on his phone, he went on to his search and there was girl's username. Now the thing is the first time I am in a relationship. I do not how I feel about him talking to or adding other girls, but right now I do not feel so good about it. In the past and my childhood my mother and father both have cheated on each other, which is why I also have high insecurity and trust issues. My parents are still together in a messed way but it became our new normal and nobody speaks about it in the family. I do not want that to happen to me. Despite them cheating, I want to be able to trust someone. He is not aware of the cheating thing and neither I am going to tell anyone I know about this because I am ashamed of it. I do not want his opinion to change for my parents. Whatever they are going through they are still my parents after all.
 

 I know this is deep rooted and I have started therapy three weeks ago, to address this. But today when I saw a girl's name on his Instagram search, I immediately shut myself off. He could sense that something was off. I went off to my house and have been ever since then trying to process how I feel. How does somebody deal with this? Do they confront their partner about it without sounding so insecure? Slip it casually to get over that thought?
 

 TLDR: I (25F) saw on his (26M) Instagram's search of a girl (22F) he looked up."
"I (28f) have always been a very anxious person, since I was a little kid. I've learned to manage it through therapy, coping mechanisms, and antidepressants (although I'm no longer medicated, I wasn't a big fan). So it's managed but it's still always there, under the surface. 
 

 A few times a year I'll go through a particularly bad phase of anxiety usually triggered by something in my personal life or more often by stuff related to my job. As of the past week I've been in one of those phases due to all these important and daunting work tasks I need to get done. I'm experiencing all of the usual symptoms: loss of appetite, nausea, sweating, difficulty sleeping, etc. But I'm also experiencing a new one this time - I am SO. FREAKING. GASSY. Oh my word it's ridiculous. And it's uncontrollable. These belches are coming out of me without any warning and they are LOUD. It's all I can do to keep my mouth shut at work so they don't escape out of me. Not only that but...the farts. I've never been a particularly flatulent lady. Even my BF who I live with has only heard me fart once or twice. I've just never really felt the need to do it much lol. He told me last night I very very loudly farted in my sleep at least a few times. He was worried there was something wrong with me lmao. I'm guessing that since I haven't been eating much due to the lack of appetite I just have a lot of air trapped inside of me.  
 

 This isn't something I'm particularly worried about. If anything it's giving me a lot of comedic relief in this time of extreme anxiety that I'm experiencing. But does anyone else experience this ever? This is definitely a new ""symptom"" for me (if you can even call it a symptom) and it's definitely directly related to my stress and anxiety. 
 

 Anyway thank you for letting me share. This isn't something I want to tell to anyone in real life other than my BF lmao."
"(28M) So I've had chronic anxiety for about 4 years now, I've dealt with the common stuff, heart palpitations, catastrophizing, etc. For about a month I've been dealing with constant dizziness, my head feels like it weighs an extra couple pounds, and my ears are always aching on and off. I know my neck and shoulder tension can lead to tension headaches but the ear thing is new was curious if anyone else experienced this."
"So basically I (28F) realized recently that I’m allowing my social anxiety to hold me back in life. Sometimes you’re aware of it, but you don’t reeeeeally realize it. I finally had an epiphany and it hit me that I want to work towards improving myself. I decided to reach out to a local Toastmasters group (for those who don’t know, Toastmasters is a public speaking organization), and they were awesome/welcomed me to sit in on a session. So tonight I attended, listened, learned, had no clue what I was doing, and even decided to participate! I was terribly nervous and it was a delightful experience. I’m even going to join and become a member of this club :)
 

 So yeah, maybe someone out there needed to hear this today. I still have social anxiety but I’m going to befriend it and work with it. Lesson learned is to go out there and get ‘em! YOU are worth it and so are your goals and dreams. Much love!"
"Hey, so I'm looking to find some nice people to talk to. Bit about me, I'm 25 from the UK. I suffer from pretty bad anxiety, insomnia and recently been
 diagnosed with DID (Split personality disorder). don't really like going out atm, which is why I'm looking for some friendships online. I do have a
 girlfriend and she's been keeping me pretty sane. But apart from that I'm into Anime, reading, drawing, music and llamas. I also like dark humour"
"I don't know if it sounds dumb, but for whatever reason I always thought I would be able to come out of the ""shell"" and be more social when I get old. Now I'm starting to realize it's the other way around. I can now go for weeks without talking to people -- literally no human contact, whatsoever -- and it barely affects me anymore. Honestly, I'm starting to enjoy how it makes me feel, being all by myself, watching Television, you name it. And when I do go out, my social anxiety is through the roof, as if I entered a reservation where wild life's on the loose 🤖"
"**EDIT: Due to some of the comments on this post, I want to iterate that my going to management was about stopping an insensitive kid from joking about suicide to the wrong person. My intent in doing what I did was not to ridicule or belittle this kid, or to bully him. The company is willing to give him a second chance, and I hope he learns from it.**
 

 Follow up to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/uud5zq/i_broke_today_because_an_employee_at_my_gym_was/) post.
 

 I spoke with gym Regional Manager (RM), who spoke with the kid. Apparently, the kid was not aware he had offended me and thought he was just messing around with a friend. Which is weird because I've said like five words to the guy up until last Friday. I sort of got blunt and said to RM, ""What kind of person doesn't know that suicide isn't something you bring up with strangers?""
 

 Per RM, the kid was really upset that he had overstepped a line with me. I get the feeling the kid is mostly upset because he got caught. RM is putting him through sensitivity training and sexual harassment training and a planned improvement program (PIP). Spoke with therapist about it yesterday, she said this is a growth opportunity for me re: boundaries. Because I’m so conflict avoidant it borders on being a pushover. She also said it bordered on sexual harassment, as he wouldn’t have said these things to another guy, but I wouldn’t necessarily go that far.
 

 It's not really enough, but I think the kid is genuinely sorry (at least sorry that he got caught). Will be wearing a hoodie and sunglasses to the gym for a bit, but I can live with that. Maybe he'll say something stupid to someone less forgiving while he's on thin ice and get axed. But—like I said—I can live with this. I don't really have the time nor social battery to expend any more energy on this kid, which includes holding a grudge against him. Contrary to what he might believe, I have a full time job and am married, and my workload has increased over the past month because we're short-staffed. I’m taking this as a sign of maturity on my end, which is what my therapist would say.
 

 Thank you for your support, it really means a lot!"
"It always makes me feel bad when someone (except my loved ones) doesn't reply me or ignores me or doesn't accept me on LinkedIn or any other social networking website. Mentioned LinkedIn specifically it is the only platform I am using to grow my network. I feel the same when others are not polite or kind or sympathetic towards me or anyone else or even pets or animals. To be honest, even though I mentioned others the feeling is worse when I am the victim lol. I am also scared thinking that whether I am bothering anyone or if I am the disturbance for anyone. On the contrary, it makes me feel better when the same people are friendly with me. I understand people have their own reasons and everyone is different. But for some reason it affects my mood even when I think about it for a few seconds. How to get rid of it? I just want to ignore all of it. I don't want to feel worse or better. Whatever the reason is."
"So a while ago i went to urgent care because of my nausea. No vomitting just really annoying nausea. 
 So i followed up with my PCM, and she had said i had gastritis, so i took my probiotics and it did get a little better. And so did my anxiety. 
 Over the past few days… my anxiety has gotten worse again and so now my acid reflux is really annoying again and ive had nausea after it leaving, and i feel really bloated and gassy. And the gas is sometimes painful…
 Does anyone else experience this with their anxiety?? I was honestly fine until a few days ago (we’re going on a trip and i think its stressing me out) but idk… im very familiar with nausea and anxiety but idk this feels different"
"I don’t know if I’ll be able to explain this properly because it’s kind of weird. My anxiety is always at its peak whenever I have to try to do something I’ve never seen others do in person, even when I know that it’s normal. For instance, my first time I tried to apply to jobs in person as a teen brought me to tears. Obviously I know that people apply to jobs all the time, but because I had never seen anyone ask for an application before, my brain had no idea what to expect. It’s a similar thing with trying to chat to new people unfortunately, since I never see people talking to strangers much either. I don’t know if anyone else experiences this or if I’m just really weird."
"As a kid, I literally used to shake whenever I need to talk to someone new or read infront of the whole fucking class and shit like that. I couldn't walk past anyone without knowing where to look or what to do, so I came up with this bizarre idea of ""vicious blinking,"" hoping that it would make me look a little busy and lost in my own world. It did help, like people started acting compassionate and showed a lot of sympathy ever since I started blinking like an idiot, perhaps it made me look innocent and helpless I guess. Now I'm 28 and can't get rid of the habit no matter how hard I try, WHATSOEVER. The habit kind of stuck with me for the past twenty years, and I don't think I'd ever be able to lose it. Besides, I'm worried that I would look super awkward if I stop my ""vicious blinking!"" And not to mention, I've a bad case of stuttering, and everytime I couldn't get a word out, I immediately start blinking to fill the awkward silence, which actually doesn't help in anyway at all. Is anyone's on the same boat as me -- coping mechanism gone wrong -- lol!

"Good morning. Last November I (f25) became a manager with the company I work for. Being so young, I have never had so many responsibilities fall on my shoulders, but recently I've realized that I do not handle confrontation well. Today I have to make a phone call regarding a small issue, part of it being my fault, for not contacting someone sooner regarding something that happened. 
 

 Currently where I live, it's 7:30 in the morning, so I don't want to call them this early. Currently, I have no idea how to reasonably cope with the anxiety/stress of having to make this phone call. I'm great at saving face and being stern in my convictions, however, inside I am an absolute nervous wreck. I simply cannot get my mind off of this. Any ideas on getting some peace and quiet in my mind? Thank you all for the help!

"I'm a 29m and my wife is a 29f. I just got my first teaching position and it involves a 45 minute commute there and back to the next town over from us. We are in the process of getting approved to get our first home/mortgage. We also have babies on the horizon, she isn't pregnant yet but wants to be soon. I feel like an anxiety-ridden mess tbh. That is soooo much to pile on at once. I can't bail on the new job, my wife would be mad at me. I also can't deny her what she wants out of life (house and kids) and I want those things too, but I also don't want to break our collective sanity. I also have OCD and major life events tend to cause it to spike, which is what is happening right now."

"(25M) Just prescribed and took my first venlafaxine last night before bed, starting with the lower dosage. I’ve never taken any medication for anxiety. Within an hour it made me shiver and eventually start uncontrollably shaking, like muscle spasms. My gf had to wrap her arms around me to calm me down. I was able to sleep but this morning was awful, I felt nauseous, had some diarrhea, and increased heart rate. Kinda made me feel more anxious tbh. I’m feeling much better this afternoon though. My thoughts are more pleasant. 
 Should I continue taking these?? I felt so weird and scared"
Hello there peeps… are there any vitamins or supplements that I can take before drinking to prevent that anxious feeling that I get after drinking? This literally just started in my life and I have been drinking since my early 20s.. I’m 28 now. I love occasionally drinking while out socializing. But I’m just so nervous that I’ll have a panic attack or become extremely anxious while or after drinking. Help please!

I suffer from severe health anxiety. I started a really clean diet but have been exercising very excessively and my anxiety level has skyrocketed. Is this normal? I've had basic metabolic panels and nothing of note.

 24F
 

 Summer of 2020 my husband and I were maybe 12 hours into a roadtrip and while I was driving I had to pee SO bad. I kept holding it in to the point I was in so much pain. While we scoured the closest town for a bathroom I started slurring my speech for maybe 10 seconds. I was completely aware but slammed on the brakes for my husband to take the wheel. I was able to speak afterwards and finally relieved myself for a good 2 minutes worth. 
 

 I am constantly thinking about that moment of not being able to speak. 
 

 Is it likely this was just a panic attack from being in so much pain? 
 

 How silly that this still haunts me two years later."
"Trigger warning i think: panic disorder and severe nausea/not being able to eat. Health anxiety as well.
 

 Hi everyone! I'm a 29F and I've had anxiety since I was maybe 14, but as of a month ago I have developed a panic disorder. I was feeling ill due to PMS, like severely dizzy. I got scared that something else was wrong with me, and it spiraled into a panic attack. I took about a day to recover and then was fine. 2 weeks later and I had an aura migraine (which is kind of normal for me) and I began panicking thinking I was having a stroke, which funnily enough was why I had the other panic attack as well. This second attack was last Saturday, and im not fully recovered yet. I am constantly having heavy anxiety. I haven't been able to eat at all, I've lost 10 pounds. I'm still bordering overweight at this point so its not an emergency per se, just really frustrating to feel weak. I work at a college and went to their health service building and saw a doctor on Monday, she was very kind and prescribed me zoloft 25mg and hydroxyzine 25mg (to take if I have a panic attack). I stated my hesitation over taking benzos, I'd prefer to avoid those. I ordered the book by Dr Claire Weekes that everyone recommends, and I've been using the DARE app and some videos on YouTube. I feel better today than I did a week ago, but I dont feel 100% at all. The resources im using say to learn to accept my anxiety and my anxious feelings, but im so exhausted from trying to do everything right and im scared I won't be myself ever again. I wake up in sheer terror every morning and can't go back to sleep. I can only sleep through the night if i take half of the hydroxyzine. I can't really use exercise as a coping method because I am not eating enough. I've been drinking Boost and Ensure meal shakes for sustenance, and can occasionally have some bread with peanut butter. I have seen a therapist every week for the last 3 years. So I do have some resources, and im really trying. Just hoping for some words of encouragement/success or suggestions from anyone who's been in my position.
 

 Please refrain from commenting if you don't have anything helpful to add, im in a very fragile space currently and don't want to be triggered...sorry to be that person to make that request."
Will I feel anxious after drinking alcohol for the rest of my life? 🥺 are there any types of alcohol that you can drink that won’t make you feel anxious afterwards?
"I was 11 years old and we were to board a train to grandparents house. And I went crazy uneasy and constantly asked my parents to hurry up or we’ll miss the train! It was the most weird feeling because I kept feeling something weird in my chest! That was my first ever anxiety incident! 
 I am 29 today and still get super anxious while boarding a train or a flight. I need to reach there hours early! I will wait for an hour even two at the station rather than reaching right on time for the train/ flight to depart! 
 

 Does anyone else have a similar travel anxiety? Can’t be only me!"
"I'm not a teen nor a kid, I'm 25 years old, and think I understand both points of view. It's funny how once you grow up you feel like this kind of things won't affect you anymore... but it does.
 

 

 So, my mom's heart is broken, I know she really loved him and I can hear her right now crying her heart out in their room. My dad told me he has been unhappy for a while, and had been thinking about this for the last 5-10 years. That just kind of broke me. Everything I thought I knew was a lie. His lie. They been together for over 26 years, I just can't believe that it's just over.
 

 

 I think he meant well, but it still makes me really wonder about a lot of stuff. My mom believes my dad has been cheating on her with a very close friend of them, and even though my dad says he's not leaving my mom for her, it feels like she might be right.
 

 

 I don't know what to do. I live with my parents since I'm still studying, I have one year left to finish, and it was just easier to stay with them. My plans are to move out of state after I finish school, but now it sort of feels like I can't leave her and my brothers alone. Specially my younger brother, he's just 13 years old and I just can't stop thinking about what this might do to him.
 

 

 I'm the eldest son, and I feel like I'm supposed to do something but I just can't, I feel like a little kid and I think something in my is breaking while I'm still in shock that this is actually happening to my family. I really thought he loved her as much as she loves him, but he just doesn't. I know he's doing the right thing for him, but I just feel so bad and so worried about my mom and my brothers.
 

 

 I can sort of relate to the way my mom feels, the only person I've ever loved didn't love me back, and I've been dealing with this heartache for almost 4 years now. I can't even begin to imagine how she must feel now after being together for so long.
 

 

 

 I really don't know what to do. It feels like a nightmare."
"Maybe ""scared"" is not a correct word. I used to try to ignore seeing people walking on the streets. I always walk looking down at the ground. But now the same thing happens when I want to use social media too. I wasn't using it much before, but now I am even hesitating to log in. 
 I also feel too tired of everything sometimes. Not physically. But emotionally and mentally. I feel like it's hopeless whatever I am doing now. I just sleep whenever I feel like that. I am good for 1-2 hours after waking up. But again I start feeling like that."
"*Trigger Warning: mention of abuse* 
 

 I (27F) am spending my Friday night curled up in a ball wondering why my heart rate won’t go down. Wondering why I’m so afraid of people being mean to me that it causes me to constantly think and worry about it. I’m always assuming the worst of people and judging myself to the harshest degree. 
 

 Why I am this way is not a hard question to answer. I’ve been this way my entire life. I’ve always had this fear inside of me, as I’ve grown and matured my fears have changed but it’s still always there, just fear and anxiety. 
 

 Some of my earliest memories are of my mother telling me not to go outside because it’s dangerous. She projected her anxieties onto me since I was very small throughout my whole life. She taught me that the world was a horrible and scary place filled with people who wanted to kidnap me and torture me and kill me. She would tell me stories about other young girls my age who were kidnapped and murdered and she showed me their pictures and told me they were just like me. I had a very warped view of the world that it was this terrible terrifying place. I was so scared to go “outside” by myself/without an adult (even my front yard) until I was in high school. 
 

 The irony of it all is my mother was so anxious of these strangers doing horrible things to me, meanwhile under her own roof I was being abused by a family member. But where was her extreme reaction when she found this out? It was nowhere to be found. Swept under the rug pretend it never happened. That’s a whole other story. 
 

 My childhood had good moments but it also had fear. So much fear and anxiety. I was scared of strangers, the dark, being alone, of UFO’s, aliens, being kidnapped, death, the list goes on and on. Did other children spend this much time ruminating in fear? Constant state of cortisol and fight or flight? 
 

 I was not setup for success in any way shape or form by my parents or my upbringing. I survived and coped how I could and I carry the weight of a difficult and anxious life on my shoulders. 
 

 I’m just so tired of feeling this way. I don’t want to be scared anymore. I’ve wasted so much energy in my life being scared for nothing, and to this day I still am, it’s just attaching itself on different things.
 

 I’m just venting. I know I’ll feel better. But this near-constant state of anxiety is not a great way to live. It has to be a combination of genetics and upbringing. But how do you fight against your dispositioned genetic makeup? Is there hope? There is as I’m better than I have been in the past, but I’m not great."
It’s so weird but something about dim lighting especially when day is turning to night makes me feel like the world is closing in on me and makes me start to panic. Also happens inside in super dark lighting sometimes or fluorescents. Weird lol
"Many of you might have such low self esteem that you need people to give you validation to do something or be invited to talk but what if I told you that you can do it too? Think about it, your social anxiety is not something that people can see, it is invisible because you don’t want people to know (yet you want people to accept it).
 

 People perceive your lack of socializing as being stuck up or serious, this means that you are seen as someone with a kind of “power.” There are people who will try to approach you with the intent of qualifying themselves to **you** as opposed to the other way around. I’m sure that doesn’t cross your mind because you’re so focused on exiting the social interaction out of fear but they may be feeling the pressure of talking to you.
 

 Next time you are having a conversation at work or school on a basis of someone approaching you to talk, try to think about the fact that they are looking at you as the authority figure (to a certain extent of course not literally), the pressure is on them not you. You don’t need to please them, they are trying to please you. Of course, many things may be running through your mind while in such interactions but that is the point, since you’re responding in such a stoic manner, they will continue to get that authoritative vibe from you. 
 

 My point is, you are all stressed out mentally from the social interaction but you don’t have to verbally try too hard. You may be worried about saying the wrong thing but in the end, their perception of you won’t change because you haven’t given them a reason to. Their default opinion (unless exposed to other sides of you) of you will not be negative, but rather, neutral."
"29f and have PTSD from an abusive relationship from when I was 19-24. Been on Sertraline (various dosages) for 3yrs and have overall seen a big improvement in emotional swings, anger, and sense of guilt/dread. 
 

 But I still find myself accidentally doing all-nighters just because I can’t stop thinking about all possible outcomes of a situation. I’ve always done this since being a child, every so often I’ll just have a night where I won’t sleep (common if I have something significant coming up) because my brain can’t switch off from thinking about all possible scenarios and what I would do/ how I’d react in that situation. 
 

 Does anyone else have this as a weird coping mechanism for ambiguous situations? And how do you manage it? I’m getting to a point where it’s now starting to really affect my life as I’m either always tired or I miss things due to oversleeping when I do finally rest. 
 

 I never spoke about it to my parents as a child as I just thought it was normal, plus I was young enough for it to not really affect my day to day. 
 

 I’d probably say it happens at least every 3/4 weeks"
"Does it happen to anyone else? Been having cramps and what I think is constipation, with a bit of bloating and a feeling of a knot in my stomach for a few days now.
 This afternoon I was feeling just fine, until I went to the bathroom, had loose stool, and now I feel the knot in my stomach again, and I'm not quite sure if there's a bit of nausea too. 
 Of course my mind goes to cancer, as it has been for the past weeks and months.  
 This was the first loose stool in a while, and as far as I'm concerned, there's never any visible blood."
"I'm shaking. I feel sick to my stomach. I have no appetite. My eyes are super bloodshot. I've been crying basically all weekend. I'm 26 and this will be my first ""9-5"" job since my early college years. I assumed I bombed the working interview, but they still hired me. Fuck."
"I (28M) live in a small-ish city (about 50k people) so I've never learned to drive. Until recently, that is. Not only do my parents not own a car, but I also have usually been able to get around either by walking or catching a bus, which I've become very comfortable with. However, my girlfriend and I are planning to move to a much bigger city next month, so I've forced myself to learn, passed the written test, and now have a driver's test scheduled for next week.
 

 I get *really* bad anxiety whenever I even think about getting behind the wheel, though. I've successfully done smallish trips -- down the road to pick up food, around my neighborhood, a 20+ minute drive to take my girlfriend out for dinner, etc. And all those trips have gone well enough, but each time my heart rate was through the roof and I was white-knuckling the wheel the entire way. On the 20 minute drive, I put on music and I genuinely didn't even listen to it because I was hyper-focused on the act of driving.
 

 Now, I can't help but think about failing the test, about crashing, etc. All the worst-case scenarios, and it's making it harder and harder for me to practice. 
 

 Does anyone have any strategies or calming things they do *before* they get behind the wheel? Is this something I just need to grit my teeth and get through? Everyone else seems to drive like it's nothing, but I can't imagine *not* being anxious about it."

My anxiety has been practically nonexistent for two and a half years. 
 For the last few months I’ve noticed this extreme anxiety creeping up on me. It’s entirely new. Everyone overthinks what they do or say that made them cringe but for the last 6? Months I’ve been overthinking every. Single. Thing. I do or say. It is absolutely crippling and genuinely makes me hate myself. There are consistently multiple instances a day that make me overthink. It’s usually something I say and it instantly makes me hate myself and I absolutely cannot let it go for days. 
 For background, I grew up with a dad and sister who CONSTANTLY picked on everything I said and put me down 24/7. I couldn’t say anything at home that wouldn’t be picked apart. But I never had anything like this even with that. This has come seemingly out of nowhere and I have no idea what to do. When I say it’s crippling, I’m not exaggerating. It doesn’t even make sense, I’m constantly told how much people like me and how friendly I am. I truly have no basis for these feelings and yet they never stop. I have no time to get to a doctor and I’m very very tight on money right now. I’ve tried workbooks to no avail. I try not to dwell but it feels impossible especially knowing tomorrow there will be more moments where I feel the same. What do I do?? Have any of you heard of something like this on this level before??"
"I (28M) have always had social anxiety, it was worst at university but I thought I had got much better in recent years. My specific issue is I can only talk to people one to one, if there's a group conversation (even just 3 people) I freeze and can't say anything and feel like an idiot.
 

 Anyway, at the weekend myself and my gf (27F) went to one of her friend's birthday party. I only knew my gf and had met a couple of others in passing. The room was split into group conversations and I couldn't bring myself to participate at all, even drinking didn't seem to help. My gf noticed something was wrong and kept asking if I was okay, I lied and said yes. After about 2 hours I couldn't take it anymore, so I went to the toilet then grabbed my shoes and left without saying anything. It was the first time I'd felt the need to do anything like this since university. I feel so embarrassed that I've made a terrible impression and not sure how I'm going to be able to see these people again. How do I get over this?
 

 TLDR: Went to a party, didn't know anyone, ran away"
"I started part time work a month ago and its a customer service job. I'm severely introverted and I really HATE people. I hate answering phones, I hate constantly having to speak, I hate having to be personable and ""on"" like im in a fucking show. I dread every shift and just cry, I don't know how to not be stressed.
 

 My family says I lack socialization and that's why I'm anxious. At 28 they dictate my choice of job because I wanted WFH. I have no car anyway. So I thought a job is a job and they'd be happy. Nope. ""You need an in person job to socialize with others"" the hours are long, the pay is shit, and it's thankless. My social battery is absolutely drained my first day back from a weekend.
 

 I'm miserable. 
 

 Im looking into therapy because my thoughts are starting to scare me. I keep questioning why I'm alive if I can't be my own person. Anxiety and my family just rule my life. 
 

 If people just left me alone and let me be who I'd like to be, I think I would be much much happier. I'm introverted and shy. That's not a crime. I'm not some feral animal who acts a certain way with humans. I know how to socialize, I'd prefer not to. I shouldn't be crucified for that."
Ever since my boyfriend of 5 years and I broke up I've been so alone. He was the only person I regularly spent time with and talked to every single day and now he's gone. I have one friend but he's been going through a lot so we haven't been hanging out or talking super often and I haven't made any friends at work or school because I feel like I don't know how to talk to anyone. I'm 25 and I feel like my social anxiety has just gotten worse and I just wanr to feel like a normal person and have friends. I hate feeling so lonely. When I'm not at work or school I'm at home and nobody texts me all day and I don't talk at work or school because I feel like I don't know how. This is killing me and I'm scared I'll be alone forever.
"i am 25. working in healthcare, ironically. i have developed severe anxiety and depression issues since middle school, there were a few years of me experiencing dissociation and selective mutism as well due to my anxiety. i still dissociate whenever i undergo a lot of stress but i learned how to manage it better. the selective mutism i haven't experienced since 16 thankfully. 
 

 as you can imagine when you're living with all that it's hard to do things that normal people take doing for granted. i spent my middle and high school and university years as well battling daily panic attacks. had to lock myself in the bathroom just to breathe or have my panic attack in peace. when i'm done, i wipe my tears, stand up, and force myself to undergo the daily battles again: say hello, communicate with other students for a graded group project, be in a classroom full of people. basically i underwent a lot. 
 

 yesterday was one of those few days where i didn't seem to overthink everything i did. i managed conversations easily, spoke my mind confidently, was just myself openly throughout the day. i thought to myself: ""maybe i'm finally cured after all those years, my hard work has paid off"".
 

 today i'm not any of that, i'm even worse than i recently have been in fact. i can't maintain eye-contact for longer than a brief moment, my voice in barely audible, i stutter with every word, and my anxiety tics are barely manageable. there were no triggers as well, something just felt off since the moment i woke up. 
 

 this was my reminder that not every day is going to be the same, and that i should be kinder to myself because its experience with the world isn't the typical one. it was nice to be normal for a day though."
"I'm (m27) just want to connect to people like me. 
 If there's any around."
I used to take adderall (unprescribed) to get work done and when I was on it all my anxiety went away and was able to learn much faster and do much better than I normally do. Dont want to depend on adderall my whole life but how do I get rid of all this anxiety to learn and just have fun with it.
"Hey everybody 👋
 I (25F) have suffered from anxiety in one form or another since middle school, and as I've had experiences it has evolved into a disorder. I'm currently in therapy, and I've made a lot of progress. I understand where most of my anxieties come from now and i was even diagnosed with PTSD, GAD and MDD. As proud as i am of the progress i am making, and the changes in my outlook i still suffer greatly from the physical symptoms of anxiety.
 I understand which situations trigger the symptoms the most, and i recognize it when it happens. At this point, i am actively anxious about experiencing anxiety more so than the actual underlying reason. I tend to experience nausea, IBS, sweating/becoming over heated, and just that general anxious feeling in my throat/stomach.
 Soon i will be in a situation full of triggers for me. I am doing progressive muscle relaxation everyday, and trying my best to talk my way through it.
 My question is: in the moment, what are some tips or tricks anyone has found to helping calm yourself?? My therapist has told me to remind myself why i am safe or visual the situation before i am there"
"I am 28 and terrified of having a heart attack, every bit of chest pain, arm pain, heart palp, I panic like crazy. 
 I'm generally healthy, don't smoke, barely drink 
 Cardio 5x a week 
 Try to eat healthy 
 I'm at work and I've just felt my chest going tight and I got really scared and had a panic attack. Can someone help?"
"Hi all, 26f here. I was a teacher for the past 4 years and my anxiety was always on edge, I was physically sick to my stomach everyday, couldn’t sleep at night. I have transitioned out of teaching into a job that is a lot less stressful, and at first I was feeling so great, but I’m now finding my anxiety creeping back up. Not sure if it’s social anxiety or just anxiety in general. If something goes wrong or I make a mistake my stomach immediately drops and I feel jittery and on edge. I’ve been avoiding caffeine, but it feels like I’m on 6 cups of coffee. I don’t think I’ve ever had a panic attack or anxiety attack, but these random peaks are starting to feel strong. 
 Burning and tightness in my chest, hard to breathe, shaking, can’t think, voice gets shaky. When this happens on the job it makes me feel incompetent and I feel like my employer can see right through me. I feel it happening everyday. Definitely gets worse around my period. 
 Thinking about doing CBT but it’s currently out of my budget. I don’t know what else to do other than trying to breathe and ground myself. Medication in the past hasn’t worked. Some days I have nothing to be anxious about, everything is fine and I’m really struggling with all the symptoms above, I literally have to make myself breathe deeply. Any tips and advice are appreciated. Thank you."
"(28f) I've been on 20mg of Vyvanse for 3 weeks (recently diagnosed) and have a bottle of multivitamins lying around (Bacopa 87.5mg included) which I decided to discontinue the moment I got my diagnosis and began taking Vyvanse. I'm about to switch to 30mg Vyvanse XR and was wondering if there's any issues I might face with adding this tiny dose of Bacopa 87.5mg at bedtime. I already feel kind of demotivated, distracted on my current dose of Vyvanse. Any suggestions are welcome. 
 PS. I also started myself on inositol 5mg at bedtime (and B12 before my morning Vyvanse) for my OCD and Anxiety. Could the lethargy I face in the daytime be as a direct effect of the inositol/B12?"
"I’m legit going to lose my mind I think! I (28f) have a great WFH job with a large corporate company. I am contracting with them and really desperately want to prove myself on being worthy to be a regular employee. BUT every social interaction I have stresses me out. Especially the large meetings with a ton of people, speaking up
 In those is like torture and my brain freezes up. I feel like I sound dumb and not “corporate” enough. I always think it’ll be easier the more I do it but doesn’t seem to be honestly. 
 

 I have to lead a call next week with over 20 people in it. I legit feel like throwing up thinking about it. And the worst part is I’ve had to do it before- i just feel so scared I don’t want to mess up. Even though last time I did fine, I know I’m going to be worked up until after it’s over next week. Anyone have these issues at work too? I need to make more money badly but this social anxiety is really getting in the way. Should I take medication? Any meds help any of you?"
"Today was my first day of training. I can't stand having that deer in headlights look, following my coworkers around and feeling completely uncomfortable. I was so anxious that I've basically forgotten over half of what I've learned. I should be proud of myself, but I'm so embarrassed."

"I am 25 and still in university. I work full time and did school part time for two years, which has slowed me down. I have to complete 5 more credits to graduate and I’m struggling to find courses that fit in my work schedule. I feel like such a loser living with my parents and still being in school. I am up and cannot sleep right now because I worry for my future. I cannot work part time and must work full time for other bills and money saving as well. I feel so lost and sick to my stomach with this realization and I cannot stop catastrophizing."
"I'm a 25 year old guy who spent much of his childhood and teenage years indoors, playing video games and doing things that left me with pretty underdeveloped social skills. 
 

 

 I try to talk to people as much as possible, but I find it tough to make friends because I get nervous, I stutter, I say the wrong things... and people make fun of my lack of skill in socializing and being comfortable around other people my age.  
 

 

 It seems like many people don't like people that are awkward, and I think it makes you the odd one out of a place such as a job or something similar. It feels like you get a reputation, and it's not easy to shake that.  
 

 

 I regret not being outside more as a kid and when I was a teenager, I feel bad for struggling to break the ice with people and make them want to talk to me because I see many people around me socialize with no problem. 
 

 

 What can I do to improve? I'm 25 but I think I'm like an 18 year old when it comes to being good at talking to people and making them feel at ease/wanting to be friends."
"I do this to myself. The day before I imagine it being great and agree to myself that I will go. The next day I start feeling nervous about it. The close it gets to the event the more stressed I get and then I end up bailing. 
 

 

 The thing is I had the option to either go biking with 20 random people or go climbing with friends later tonight. I choose familiarity. 
 

 

 I can do great in situations where I know people. I can feel relaxed. I even dont mind online dates. I feel less stress about online dates then I do about meetups. 
 

 

 I feel like the only way I could handle meetups is if I had a friend that I pulled along with me. 
 

 

 I feel like a wimp for dodging out last minute. I should be able to go out these events. I little felt a bit of panic when the time was coming closer. 
 

 

 In the end I choose the option that relieved that stress. The best way to get to know people it seems is through other friends. I am 29m btw. I want to meet more women in person vs online dating, but its so hard.  
 

 

 If I am doing trivia with friends and women is there that I click with I can handle that. If its an environment where I am unfamilar with and dont know anyone I freak out. Online dating actually seems to work for me a bit becuase I meet just one person.  
 

 

 Any suggestions?"
"I've had anxiety for most of my adult life, I think I was 19 when my first kid was born, well, I'm 28 now with 6 kids, an 3 baby mamas. I love my kids all to death. But due to certain circumstances I'm dealt I definitely have vastly different relationships with each one of my kids. As a parent we all worry, some more than others, I worry about all my kids, but one specifically more than others to be honest, I almost feel guilty for it. but should I? I have anxiety about but a lot of different things, in particular, death. I almost have a fascination with it. But I worry about horrible things happening to that one specific child obsessively and it kills me inside just imaging these things happening to my sweet baby. And these thoughts occur way more often then they should. Is this a regular thing? I have a therapist and a psychiatrist, and I've even mentioned something about this to both of them before.. Does any one else think about shit like this or am I losin it."
"Hi all ,
 28F here,
 i'm debating if i should start again going to therapy regarding my health anxiety... my former therapist has changed his hours and when she can i'm still at the office, she is a very good therapist and i'm afraid to try another one,but the circumstances force me to changed it . Someone tried going to therapy and how was it? 
 

 thanks."
"TW: Self Harm, SA
 

 This might seem more like a legal issue, but I’ll cut to the point. A spiteful ex (25F) posted lies about me (26M) doing unthinkable things on Facebook. Since I found this out through a friend, I haven’t been able to sleep or eat. I’m so terrified of police just showing up because she might accuse me of something I didn’t do. They wouldn’t ask me just take me away. I suffer from claustrophobia and I just know any amount of time in a cell would be catastrophic to my mental health to the point I imagine myself trying to get shot by the police before complying with them. I imagine because I’m male nobody would care what I had to say until a court. Sure I probably wouldn’t lose an actual case for SA because there’s no evidence because it never happened. But the slight chance of a knock on my door to be taken to a cell has me not sleeping and not eating. Every car that passes by is another panic. I don’t know what to do. Contacting her is out of the question."
I’m starting to think mine is from the last 20 years of dealing with anxiety. I’m not a mom of a toddler too so that’s sometime hard on the back. I’ve been doing yoga for the past week not sure if it’s helping. Just sucks being in constant pain. My muscles are SO tight. Also got some TMJ going on too I believe 😩
"I’ve been out of college for almost five years now, and for the most part I’ve been bouncing around from one retail/customer service job to another, while living with my parents. The state of the world the past few years hasn’t made me feeling super motivated to “jump out and start my career!” I’ve just started taking online classes in CG animation, which I feel like is the closest thing to a career path that I have, similar to hobbies/passion projects of mine.
 

 Now that I’ve gotten into the class, while I like some of it, there’s a ton of techno-stress involved, and the software(s) are kind of overwhelming, like learning a new language. I’m already not the most financially smart or stable person, and I thought that learning CG animation was going to be the way I would end up earning some real adult money, but now I’m kind of scared and anxious about how daunting the software looks? Can anyone help boost my morale about this?"
"I’m M27 in good physical shape and overall health. I recently started my 3rd attempt of trying to progress through a Bachelor Degree at university. I haven’t taken any classes since COVID in 2020 and have been doing physical arborist work for the last 2 years before I decided to go back. Coincidentally I broke my wrist at work and now off for the last month, just doing school. I thought at first it would make school easier, but I find I have more anxiety as ever. I try to stay positive and do positive things like be outside and play with my dog, yet everyday all I feel is like everything around me is hanging by a thread and I can’t even bring myself to enjoy things anymore as I feel too locked in my anxiety. I know part of it comes from my recent ADD diagnosis that hiders me from achieving on a high level that I expect of myself and another part I can’t figure out is how to deal with everything else going on in the world. I feel so exhausted about what it feels like negativity all around. Inflation, no career prospects, everywhere I feel I look is just bunch of people are just coping with life. How do you enjoy life when you feel always behind. I wrote a test today with a an actual kid in my class today and after I knew I did terrible on it despite trying to study for a whole week straight, all I could think about is I am f***ed. I have a gf and seemingly fine relationship, but I know she always stresses about finally making it and getting out of this broke figuring your life out situation and that just adds more anxiety to me. I already feel not good enough, not smart, not social, nothing special and I have no idea how I can get to have those things. All I hear from everyone is you just got to grind it out and I tried, I worked for 70 hours a week, I tried saving all the money I could and yet seemingly life happened and I feel no better off. Yeah I am thankful I have food and I’m not homeless but is there anything else? I want to do better and be happier and I hate feeling this way because it’s almost impossible to find motivation to achieve something if I am unable to even envision a happier life. I tried talking to therapist and psychiatrist. One said to keep doing what I’m doing and all that motivational jargon and other one suggest 10 different pills. Is that my only choice? To suck it up?"
"I have anxiety and panic disorder, but this pain is exactly at my heart. Its been going on for years and the pain often trails down my left arm. It also seems to get worse from non anxiety related things like masturbations or exorcise. I've had a an ultrasound of my heart done and they said they couldn't find anything wrong. I've also noticed I can stretch or push down on the area with pain for it to go away.
 

 Does anybody else have issues like this?"
"I will say that from the moment we've met, he's historically been terrible at replying to my messages (i.e. takes hours to reply), so this isn't an issue of a sudden lack in communication. However, I noticed these last few days, he's been spending an unusual amount of time on Instagram (i'm aware i'm borderline stalking him at this point but i cant help it). Of course, this has me spiraling; ""Is he talking to other girls??"" ""If he can find time to be on instagram, then why can't he text me back??"" ""Is he losing interest??""
 

 I know we both need space and time to ourselves but i'm still really worried. I'm 99% sure he wouldn't talk to other girls and I don't have any reason to suspect that he is. When i'm with him, he gives me 100% of his attention and makes it pretty obvious he wants me there. I'm very close to snapping on him but afraid that could be sabotage. For all I know, he could be mindlessly scrolling through the Instagram Explore page. I've definitely been there before. 
 

 I know the best thing is to be vulnerable and tell him exactly how i've been feeling, rather than continue to let this fester in my head, but I have no idea how to go about that without fear of seeming insecure, needy, or crazy.
 

 Thank you for letting me get this off my chest. It actually feels good to spill this all out somewhere."
"Let me explain, I (28F) am preparing to finally move out of my parents house. It’s a big house and now I’m moving to a small cottage area much closer to my work. It’s everything I wanted… 
 

 But…
 

 I realized I have a huge amount of junk and going through it only for a few minutes put me on edge! I don’t know why I feel so emotional and freaked out right now. I want to cry!
 

 Is it my fear of moving? Is it my fear of failing living on my own (being on the autism spectrum enhances it)? Is it my fear of being alone even though it’s what I wanted!? I don’t know what’s going on!
 

 Has anyone dealt with something like this? How did you overcome it? Or if your going through it, I’d like to hear us not being alone in the struggle"
"I'm a first year teacher and my wife and I just bought a house. We have been together almost 7 years. I have OCD and my cycles of anxiety and rumination and rehashing things that scare me have weighed on her more than I knew and she's opened up to me about it recently. She's indicated that she can't take another episode of me breaking down when my OCD-related anxiety is high. That coupled with the anxiety produced by us getting into our first mortgage and me getting into my first job teaching has made it clear that I need to go to treatment because I'm not effectively managing my disorder and I haven't been the entire time we've been together and just my entire life in general. I'm checking in to Rogers behavioral health for a 4-6 week partial hospitalization program (6 hours of therapy a day, 5 days a week and I go back to my grandma's house at night). So I'll be away for 4-6 weeks and it is going to be expensive. My parents will help us financially when its all over, but insurance is being a pill and as of right now it is out of network. The good faith estimate says that the cost will likely be between 16 and 23k when all is said and done. They have financial aide/grants that you can apply for, but this is going to be a large burden for all involved. I've applied for PFML with work. If anybody has been to Rogers and dealt with their financial programs, please please share."
"Does anyone else have the internal conflict of wanting a certain look because it’s how you feel inside, but looking that type of way garners too much attention from people? And you HATE it? I (28F) am a diehard cybergoth that lives in a conservative midwestern town that only sees like 3-4 types of personal aesthetic on the regular and I get lots of looks and questions from strangers. Family members are always curious about me too and I just hate all of the attention, but no one understands because they all think I want the attention because of how my outfits and makeup look.  I can’t just want to look how I do because I feel like my best self this way, and am making the most of the gifts I’ve been given."
"It would make me feel better or worse after seeing the results. So posting it.

And that it would tell you what you should be doing with your life? For me I think about my career/work. I just wish I knew. I'm only 28 and I just feel lost and unhappy. I feel like I wasted my life and I'm going to continue wasting it.
"Hi.. (m26), I just moved to a rather smallish rural area in South Mississippi. It’s my dads hometown and I have family in the area. So I’m not alone or anything like that. But, I got a job working for the school district and I’m one of the few black people within the school system and the only black male…and I’m gay. I knew going into this move that I could potentially come across a few who disagree with me as a person and I’ve tried to prepare myself for that. We’ve just made it past the first nine weeks and I think I’ve adjusted well enough. I get along well my kiddos and have good laughs with a few colleagues. However I feel like there a few teachers and administrators who either haven’t warmed up to me yet or just don’t like having me around. They seem pleasant when we are in a group, but are very rigid in one on one situations or even passing in the hallways. I know this town and state is pretty conservative but I can’t figure out if they act this way with me because I’m gay, black, male or a combination of the three. I don’t know, this may read like a trivial situation but I have felt unwanted at times and it really beginning to get to me. I don’t want to have my own negative feels to get in the way this job, because I really like helping the kids I work."
"I'm supposed to be hanging out with an old friend of mine tomorrow, haven't seen them in over 6 years. I'm nervous/jittery about the situation because I'm like 20lbs+ heavier than I was the last time I saw them, even though I have recently lost weight.
 

 I'm ngl, I am a much more comfortable person personality-wise than I was back then, but I'm pretty insecure about my physical appearance, mostly and obviously where my weight is concerned. Could really use some support here, thanks in advance!"
"I started hydroxyzine 5 days ago (25 mg) and I only take it at night. I suffer from nighttime anxiety/panic attacks due to recent trauma. 
 

 The first night I took it, it knocked me out and I slept like a baby. However, I no longer feel drowsy when I take it. The worst side effect I now have is suddenly waking up in the middle of the night. It's like a massive jolt (typically in my chest) that immediately wakes me up. I'll fall back asleep but it'll persist every hour (2:30 AM, 3:30 AM, 4:30 AM etc. until I wake up). 
 

 Does anyone else deal with this hydroxyzine side effect? Does it go away after a while? It helps my anxiety decently but I can't keep dealing with these ""jolts"" 😢"
"26m.
 

 So I've had covid and had one vaccine so far.
 

 I've had a whole host of symptoms since which I'm really trying to accept is just health anxiety as they have somewhat calmed down since I've been on medication. 
 

 I constantly see these articles come up about vaccine related deaths or the high amount of excess deaths in the past few years compared to pre pandemic. 
 

 Have there actually been a considerable amount of excess deaths in young adults over the past few years? Or is it just that when a young person does nowadays its way more publicised that it would have been before?
 

 It's hard not to let the anxiety go off the deep end when every 5 minutes another article pops up about some young adult who suddenly died without a clear cause. 
 

 Not trying to start an arguement or anything about vaccination as personally I think it's up to the individual.
 

 Just looking for some reassurance in the form of actual studies etc or experiences."
"I've never done anything like this before. I think this is the right subreddit to use, but I'm sorry if this isn't. Also, please excuse how much of a mess this might read. My head space has been all over the place. Marked NSFW in case of any potential trigger warnings.
 

 For context, I'm a 26F who just graduated college in August. It took me a while since I ended up switching majors, but I'm now Nurse with a BSN. I took about a month-long break to relax and got a nice job lined up for me for the middle of October. I have never been known to cry and have always been regarded as level-headed and mature. I used to be excited about the future, but now I'm crying every night and can't will myself to engage with hobbies or friends. 
 

 Everything was fine until a week ago. For work, I had to get an apartment out of town, which was understandably stressful, but it would be the first time I would be living on my own. I had to move in and sign the papers on my own, and while I managed to hold it together, I had a complete breakdown when I went back home at the end of the day (I only managed to bring some things up to the apartment, not enough for me to live in it yet). 
 

 The thought of leaving home finally hit me, and that night I ended up experiencing my first panic attack. By, Friday I ended up buying out my lease just so I could stay at home. I convinced myself that I could easily make the commute three days a week and spend the night in a hotel if needed, but even the thought of spending a single night outside of my house scared me (even though I was just fine two weeks ago staying in a hotel on vacation). By Monday, I ended up sending my termination letter before I even started to work. 
 

 However, quitting my job and leaving the apartment only provided temporary relief. My mom doesn't care what I do as long as I'm happy, so she's not upset about the situation, just worried. However, my only goal in life was to repay her for raising me and caring for her. 
 

 That's still the plan, but now I can't escape this crushing thought that one day she'll die, and I'll be all alone. Not moving out of the house is only delaying the inevitable. The last time I had these thoughts was when my dad died, and I just accepted that once mom passed, I'd probably just off myself since I did my job. I got over that, but now it's back stronger than ever. I can't stop thinking about how many years I have left with her. 
 

 The feeling gets worse at night, but it's gotten to the point where I can't will myself to hang out with friends or enjoy my hobbies because all I can do is hyper-focus on my fears. I starve until I force myself to eat and get sick when I do. Meanwhile, all I want to do is either sleep or sit on my phone trying to find any amount of reassurance that I'll be fine. 
 

 Being alone was never a problem for me, it was something that I enjoyed, but now I can't bear the thought of it. I've been spending all my time at my sister's house since she works from home, but soon her boyfriend will be back from vacation, and I'll be all alone at my mom's until she comes back from work in the evening. The only time I was genuinely happy this week was over the weekend because I got to spend it with mom, but even then, every time I looked at her, I had this sense of dread in the back of my mind reminding me of the inevitable. So even just thinking of going back to her place fills me with pain because not only do I not want to be alone for most of the day, but I also don't want to look at her and be reminded of my thoughts. 
 

 Considering how desperate the need for nurses is, I'm not worried about finding a job and submitted several applications to the local hospitals. I even got excited at the thought of working at some of the places, but to be honest, nursing isn't something I particularly enjoy. It's just something I picked because my first degree wasn't working out, and I needed to make a choice. I just need to work on the floor for a year or so before I can get a cushy office job or something, but until then I'm going to have the constant fear of making a mistake, and I'll no longer have the safety net of being a student to protect me. I'm worried that if I can't last a year at the bedside, then my mom will be the one taking care of me when I get stuck with some minimum wage job that won't even be enough to support myself let alone the both of us when she retires. 
 

 I haven't been this stressed in my entire life, not when my dad died and not when I went through nursing school. I don't know if this is just years of bent-up stress finally getting to me or if this is normal to experience now that I'm supposed the be an adult. 
 

 I used to be proud of the fact that I could soon provide for my mom and give her everything she wanted, I didn't care what people would think about me being single and living with her. But now I feel like a failure knowing that I couldn't last three days without her working out of town. Yet I also can't bear the thought of what will happen 30 years from now. 
 

 The sad part is, is that I've managed to do it before. Before my dad died, I used to work at a tech camp on the other side of the state. I'd be gone for the whole summer and be upset when I had to go back home. Then my dad died, and I managed to leave for camp again, but then I'd find myself coming home every weekend to be with the family. I thought because it was the first year my dad died, it made sense for me to spend my free time with them. Then year two came, and I hated every minute I was working at camp. In year three, I ended up quitting camp because I couldn't stand my coworkers anymore. Though I'm beginning to think maybe that wasn't the case and that this was where the problem started, I just didn't know it. 
 

 My mother knows what's going on, but she's never seen me act like this before and doesn't know what to do. Right now, she's healthier than me but, she has a problem that the docs haven't been able to diagnose, so whenever she does get sick, I'm the only one that can take care of her. It's already happened once where she ended up having an episode that I wasn't there for, and she has surgery coming up that's going to take her out of work for a month. She says she's fine, but a part of her seems like she's a bit relieved that I'm staying. On the other hand, I know she feels guilty about me staying behind and always tells me that I need to get out more or drops hints about me getting married. 
 

 I don't know what to do, and I'm at my witts end. I'm hoping the new job will get back to me soon because staying at home is doing nothing for me. My hope is that the job will keep me preoccupied but what happens when a new change in life happens and I'm met with these thoughts again? Is this something that'll just pass like all the other times or is there a bigger problem at hand? Has anybody else been in my position? If so, how long did it take for you to get over it? I just want these feelings and thoughts to stop, but no matter what I do I can't push them away."

"It usually takes me at least two hours for me to fully fall asleep. I (25F) recently realized that part of this might be because of the anxiety attacks I get when I hear my roommate (29F) having loud sex.
 

 Every night my roommate brings this dude she met online (who’ve I’ve never met in person before) and they make a lot of loud noise in their nightly sex routine (bed creaking, moaning/dirty talking, going in and out of the bathroom, floor shaking). We also share a thin wall, and I sleep in living room of the apartment, so I have no door. Anyways I noticed that every time this is going on (0.5-1 hour), I can feel my heart racing so fast and I start sweating. I try to distract myself by watching YouTube videos, wearing earplugs, calling my friend, etc but I still feel the vibrations from their noise and can’t completely block out what’s going on. Maybe the anxiety is coming from my personal trauma from an abusive ex, or general anxiety from hearing all this chaotic noise as I’m trying to rest. 
 

 I’m not sure what the true cause is, but when I talked to my roommate about my anxiety and asked if they can keep it down a bit, she basically told me that my mental health problems are causing a burden on her and that I should consider moving out if I can’t accommodate to other people’s basic habits. (But i also don’t understand this comment because SHE’S subletting this room from ME - and I’m living in the living room for now to save some money..and yes I get it it’s my fault for being cheap here but I wish she could be a bit more understanding)
 

 Anyways, I’m wondering if I’m being overly dramatic or if I should see a therapist. Either way, I start work at 5am every day and with at most 4 hours of sleep per night, it’s affecting my ability to function adequately through daily tasks."
"Hi I’m 28M a couple of weeks back I ended up in the hospital for what I thought was a heart attack. While in the emergency room I started trembling like crazy and could not control my body to stop, my heart was beating almost out of my chest, had the feeling of throwing up etc. it’s important to mention that that one week I drank just coffee not even a little of water so we all thought that, that most of cause the ‘attack” and my body just gave up on too much coffee since that same night I had drank 7 cups. I already had my heart checked and it’s not ok since there is a problem on one of the heart chambers (right) I have less beats that a normal heart. But the thing is that I still feel weird ever since that day on the hospital, I haven’t feel myself. I can’t concentrate on anything, I get dizzy most out of the blue during the day, my mouth goes dry and my heart starts beating like crazy and I can hardly breathe. I know that those are the symptoms of an anxiety attack. If I do have a anxiety disorder (WHICH I STILL NEED TO GET A CHECK UP ON THAT to be sure) but if I do have it, why now? I’m a healthy person, walks a lot eats well etc. Can a disorder like that just happen? Honestly I feel so hopeless right now, I feel like crying out of the blue I feel disconnected from everything and everyone, not even my hobbies help me since it has gotten sooooo hard to focus on a task. And when I do enjoy my self again it happens, I get anxious out of the blue and start getting dizzy and all the already mentioned symptoms. I’m not looking for any doctor advice but some light on what’s is going on with me, I want to feel like myself again, I like I be alone a lot of the time but not even that is the same so please help."
"27M here, recently I’ve had disturbances when trying to get to sleep. I’ll be laying down and suddenly feel like my heart rate drops, I get a horrible sinking feeling and as a result I sit half up in a shocked manner and the feeling goes away. Unfortunately this wakes me up whilst I am trying to get to sleep and has resulted in ‘early nights’ becoming ‘late nights’. I feel like it is anxiety related because there are times I can control it with breathing or mentally and stop it from happening. Has anyone else experienced the same?"
"There should be a movie made about what happened to my partner and I last night. I’m mortified, I cannot sleep, cannot eat , think, drive. Anything. Everything is too much. 
 

 My partner (27M) &amp; myself (26F) share a birthday a few days apart. We decided to stay at his parents house for a fun family day, where our families intermingled. Well one thing led to another, and everyone got piss drunk, couldn’t drive, and slept over. 
 

 His parents have a very roomy home, so there was MORE than enough room for everyone to sleep comfortably. 
 

 My partner and I decided to crash in his old bedroom. Just the TWO of us…3AM, both wine drunk adults, we decided to have sex. Fine cool awesome. It’s 3AM… I’m not so sure if we were both so drunk, that we didn’t know who was awake still, or if collectively our parents were all four really drunk and didn’t know we WOULD NOT be asleep.
 

 His parents, my parents barge in , yelling , singing and dancing to ABBA at THREE AM WHILE WE ARE ACTIVELY FORNICATING. 
 

 IMMEDIATELY - I’m hiding he’s hiding, our parents are in this weird mixture of almost laugh scream crying. 
 

 I cannot look at my parents or his parents for the rest of my life. I really have been SO fucking god damn anxious and NOTHING is calming me down. I haven’t spoken to my parents, and I couldn’t look his parents in the eyes at breakfast the next day. The breakfast table was in fact silent. 
 

 Similar stories &amp; coping mechanisms limited to, but not including alcohol ARE VERY WELCOMED."
Find themselves sometimes wishing they had some kind of disability that made you unfit for work so that you didn't have to suffer with SAD at the workplace? Yes I know it's irrational but that's how I feel sometimes.
"So I work as a receptionist in a GP clinic in England. I deal with all sorts of patients on the phone everyday. I have been working there for 6 months now. Today, for the first time since I’ve started working there, a patient wanted to file a complaint against me because he wasn’t getting what he wanted. 
 

 In our clinic, we have a triage list which is open for same day GP appointments. When it is full for the day (usually within an hour), we advise patients to call back the next morning at 8 or we can send them a link to request for an appointment online. 
 

 Sometimes they’re okay with that, but most of the time they’re not happy about not getting an appointment. Now as a receptionist, we can’t book patients in for appointments if the list is full for the day. If it is an emergency, we are told to advise the patient to contact emergency services, we even offer them the number.
 

 A patient called today to book an appointment for a routine checkup because he hasn’t seen a doctor in 2 years. He said he has Erbs Palsy. Which he was diagnosed with 3 years ago,but he just wanted a routine checkup. I asked my manager for advice because we had no appointments left. My manager checked his records and told me to advise him to call tomorrow morning or request for an appointment online. He was obviously not happy about that. He was very rude and was acting like an entitled child. I told him that I do not have the authority to book an appointment for him if there are no slots left, and that I am just doing I am told by my manager. He was not listening to anything I was saying and just wanted to complain about me. He took my name down and said he will be complaining about me. I told him that is fine and that I have recorded the call as evidence of his behaviour.
 

 My manager listened to the recorded call and praised me for the way I handled the situation and said that a lot of people try to act threatening just to get what they want.
 

 Even though I know that I didn’t do anything wrong, and that I was just doing my job. It bothered me. I suffer from severe anxiety and panic attacks so it has been bothering me all day. I know this was nothing compared to what some of my colleagues have experienced; two of them received death threats, one experienced racism. And all that just because the patients can’t get an appointment. But it still got to me"

Everyday I’m miserable with something. Right now I have a terrible cold and then got a migraine on top of that. When I’m not sick I have TMJ so chronic pain. Also chronic back pain from years of anxiety. My health anxiety makes me so scared of everything and yet if it weren’t for my two year old son I almost would wish I wasn’t here anymore. Therapy doesn’t seem to be helping much and I’m too scared to try prescription drugs. Ugh I just want to feel normal 😩😭
"I (25M) have never been officially diagnosed with social anxiety, but it just kind of explains my behavior thoughout my whole life. Many thinkgs I look up about social anxiety mention pysical symptoms but I don't have those but I am still living behavioruly of social axneity. Now I just have these mental blocks where I just cannot will myself to do things that I am sure most people have no problem with. It feels like I am just kind of hit a wall and can't make myself do things that literally have no downside of me doign them... like phone calls, asking questions,. I definitely used to have physical symptoms when I was younger. I remember when I had to go summer school and it was at a different high school and I was be extremely nauseous all day and would be throwing up literally the time. I would also get really panicy and feel terrible and anxious for the first several months at my first job as a teenager as a cashier. I used to have such bad social anxiety when I was younger, where I could never order anything for myself, I could never ask a teacher a question, even as a teenager I just couldn't advocate for myself or ask anyone things. I'ma bit better in some ways as an adult.
 

 Now I don't have like any physical symptoms, and in general some of my fears that used to be paralyze me have gone away. My biggest fear used to be fear of authority especially, but maybe I just have a good boss and I don't feel that at all anymore. But in other parts of life I am just thwarted by this indescirble inablity and paralsis to do things, usually it seems when there is an unknown situationa and I fear other people will judge me or think of me as weird. I can't often do things that I need to do that are literally no problem for others. I often have to pre plan social situations for an long amount of time and I have to follow those steps otherwise I just feel this paralysis and totally unware of what to do... it's kind of ritualistic. I often have fears of how people think of me, like I am so afraid of people thinking I am stealing so I am constatly monitroing my behavior to make sure It doesn't appear that I am stealing... but I think this backfires because I've been accoused of shopliffing like three times though I have never stole anything. If I think someone catches me doing something that I may think they could judge me on, I will act like I am doing something else.
 

 One example is that when I was in grad school I was in a class in a building that I wasn't in much and it had a strange layout, and I had to pee very bad (I drink a lot of water), and Instead of just asking (because I can't ask people things like ever), or instead of just looking for it (I do not want people to think I am just wondering around for some reason), I just held it in until I got home (hour or so later) and was in extreme pain.
 

 It hurts to when It's something I have in which I have to advocate for myself in some way. I have an online doctor for ADHD medication managemtn and she told me some diffirent way to get refills in which I have to contact the online platform first instead of the pharamcy, and I was confused by this but I just couldnt ask for her to explain what I needed to do. Anyways, I have needed a refill for over a week now and it took me a week to build up the courage to call the pharamcy for them to tell me that they dont have the prescitipition... which I would have known if I just asked about that to my doctor, and my life has been a bit of a wreck without my medicine which I still don't have a prescitipion for.
 

 I don't really have any friends and my husband is the only person I talk to, so I am kind of lonely. I don't really have great social skills, and I usually annnoy people if they do become friends with me (...usually some adhd tangent.). every time It comes up I could like hang out with people and I just institicvely think of an excuse. I think i'd like friends but it's hard because I'm in a new area and don't know anyone and can't just put myseflk out there. I am pretty good in controlled situations, like at work I am actually really talkiitive, but if there is a meeting I am presenting on I get amazinzgly aware of how I a sound and treully scared of how they may think of me (I don't have great speaking skills and sometimes jumble up words and people sometyimes dont understand me well)."

Im F25 and I’ve been struggling badly with my anxiety. I get panic attacks almost daily and its become a disorder. Ive scraped the top of my back to the point where i have scars. The only thing that keeps me calm is freezing myself with the AC while playing a game on my phone. This is all scary and im so scared to get back on meds. The zoloft i used to take for depression gave me a horrible reaction when i started taking them again a few weeks ago so I had to stop using them. It amped up my anxiety so much i couldnt function. I was constantly shaking and paranoid that something was wrong with me. I just desperately need something that will work. Im also a hypochondriac and right now the focus is on my heart. With the panic attacks it feels like my heart is gonna pop out my chest and i try my best to tell myself im safe and im ok. Im just sick of feeling like this and I want to feel normal again.
"Recently I've regressed a lot. Panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, the feeling that I have to self harm... I got health leave from work, and just thinking about going back there makes me panic again. 
 

 And I can't... idk, vibe with my therapist anymore. She's... idk, too optimistic? Too focused on doing? Rn all I want is to rest. To relax - what is hard to do bc I just started uni - I want to step back. 
 

 But all I hear is - you can't run. Go back to work, do those exercises, you can do this!
 

 I really can't. I hate my job, I hate people there, all it does is bring me down. I really want to catch a breather. I want to calm down, rn I have barely any energy, everything is a fckng chore. How can I go back to living as if nothing is wrong when I don't even have the energy to do the dishes or take a shower? To undress myself before sleep? 
 

 She's also very much against meds - but they do help me. Advises herbal stuff, exercises, and isn't happy when i say that my meds help me.
 

 Idk what to do. Should I wait, but if so, for what? Should I look for someone else? I used to look forward to therapy, now I dread it bc I don't agree with so much stuff, I have a hard time following the advice, it feels so overwhelming!
 

 Thank you if you read the whole thing, I wanted to ask a short question but fck, I needed to write it all down."
"Hi all. I'm 27 and suffered with depression and anxiety nearly my whole adult life. I don't know why I I want it. I've tried CBT, counselling, talking therapies and groups and nothing works. I'm on 40mg citalopram a day and propranolol. My anxiety recently is off the scale, I am paranoid and anxious things are going to happen to me when they probably never will. I'm anxious people are watching me, people are looking for me. I don't want to feel like this and I consider myself a fairly normal person but lately I don't know why this has come on this bad. I'm struggling to get through each day now.
 

 I've tried talking to the doctors most of which suggest I come off my meds and switch to a different one however it scares the shit out of me to come off what I am on to then switch. I feel like I need much more help and perhaps there more of a mental illness there than anxiety - I don't have the money for private consultations and the NHS don't seem to want to help anymore than meds and offering therapies that don't help.
 

 I dont want to top myself... not yet so I'm not a risk. However I am really really REALLY struggling and don't know what to do or turn.
 

 Has anyone got any advice on what I could do?
 

 I thank you in advance from the bottom of my heart!
 

 Tom"
"Just to ad a bit of context I almost feel like its rude for me to post like my feelings are invalid due to my situation.
 

 Im recently married and have a fantastic relationship with my wife, my job pays very well and I live a pretty comfortable situation.
 

 I moved far away from my home town with my wife to take a new job, so I have had no friends for the last 5 years, which doesnt concern me - I enjoy isolating myself and spending time with my wife who has quite a similar personality to me.
 

 Ive begun to run into issues at work where during a 'Shift Debrief or Handover' I physically cannot talk, i begin to well up and almost end up in tears, I have no reason to be nervous or scared as I am quite good at my job and recieve alot of praise, but when it comes time to talk to figures of authority my mind just goes blank and I begin to panick and cant talk.
 

 As a male I feel like anxiety isnt really talked about especially in a blue collar workplace, I understand the anxiety and panic attacks I am having but are more so asking how men in particular have dealt with similiar issues?
 

 Thanks in advance."
"I don't remember being introverted when I was young. I was everyone's friend and the popular kid at my elementary school. I was part of every extracurricular activity my school had to offer, always raised my hand to participate in any social opportunity. I developed my anxiety issues in 7th grade and it has been a part of me ever since. Perhaps it's the sharp contrast between the person I was and the person I've become that drives me to measure my victories by how socially engaged I am throughout the day.
 

 My anxiety isn't just social, but my brain insists that's the most important part to treat. I've always had this demand from myself to be the social butterfly I was when I was 12. It was hard to know if I'm introverted, simply grew up and changed as a person, or if it's my anxiety manipulating me to get away from the crowds since I developed my anxiety disorder so young. 
 

 I think now I'm content with the person I am. People exhaust me, people are unpredictable most of the time and require your energy to cater to their needs. Whenever I let someone get to know me I'm always surprised by how dark they can be after all, how they wouldn't think twice before stepping over me to get something they want more. It seems logical to me to not hurt others, but a lot of people aren't that way. It's hard to beat this mindset when it's stemming from a place of experience. I don't even want to trust anyone. I don't know if my mental health has anything to do with this, but I've always found it hard to have causal relationships with people. I either love someone unconditionally or have no relationship at all. Normals aren't that way, and maybe that's why I'll never be the person I was when I was 12, because I know better now."
"Hello everyone, I'm 27 and just got a diagnosis that I have a mutation in my brca2 gene that makes my probability of having breast cancer 60% and of having ovary cancer 20% ,which is much higher than the general population, throughout my life. How can I deal with this with my anxiety? How will I be able to live with this clouding my mind at every second? I can't stop thinking and crying about it."
"Can anxiety manifest this way? It seems my mind is fixated on death, even if I recognize that I don't want to die. 
 

 

 I think I'm scared of death more than anything. I've been dealing with a lot of grief after losing two family members.
 

 I guess I'm afraid that there is something wrong with me. My doctor told me very recently that my EKG was good and that she isn't concerned about my heart. 
 

 

 There are times where my chest hurts and I get intense stomach pains, though, and that's when my mind starts to go in a different direction. 
 

 

 How do you avoid living in fear of death? Before I lost my family members, I didn't think about death this often. Now it's a constant thought, and I don't know how to get my mind off it."
"I’ve (29F) had a trip planned with my husband and friends for about 6th months. It’s an international trip, and we leave tomorrow. I’m canceling it today. Ever since I had Covid in January, and two other sicknesses that required antibiotics, I haven’t felt like myself. The small amount it takes to trigger full body panic is crazy. I have been so excited about this trip, but now leading up to it, I can’t think about going without the full body panic feeling. I typically get anxious before a trip, but I’ve never canceled anything. This feels different to me, but there’s still a nagging feeling in the back of my head that says “don’t let anxiety beat you.” I’m pretty in tune with my body, and can feel when things feel off, and this doesn’t feel like my typical anxiety I get. I’m 95% confident about canceling, getting some blood work done and getting some health answers before scheduling another trip. I’d love some words of encouragement."
"I've always struggled with goals, time management etc but ever since moving to my own place and living alone and being unemployed and depressed I have fallen into the deepest rut and I don't know how to climb out. 
 

 I'm on government disability benefits (although they don't even fully cover my rent alone) and I've been trying to find a job for over a year with no success (which is quite baffling because I've worked with different employment services and all of them say I have an excellent resume and I interview well and if a potential employer were to look at my social media there's nothing but animal content and photos of my family). 
 

 In the meantime I'm an artist and jeweller and I've got many different artsy skills and I'm trying to make product to hopefully sell to get a little cash but... I never finish anything. By the time I get close to the final steps of something I'll always end up having an interesting idea to try something else and I cannot seem to get out of that hyperfocus and thus I have thousands of unfinished projects. 
 

 Also, I'm just horrible at Adulting and sticking to any somewhat regular schedule. Even if I'm starving I'll hold off making myself some food or eating leftovers because I'm working on something so I'll eat at inconsistent times of the day. I wake up and go to bed at inconsistent times and I really struggle to get out of bed overall. 
 

 I don't know how much of my daily struggle is the ADHD or if it's actually the depression but something needs to change because I am not living. 
 

 The last few weeks I haven't hardly bathed, gotten out of the apartment or even taken out the trash because I don't want anyone to see me but my trash will reek and I'll be overcome by fruit flies. I have truckloads worth of laundry to do but I just keep pushing it off. Even if I've forced myself to shower, because I have no clean bedding available I've been putting towels down on the bed and using a poncho as a blanket and I've been doing this for over a week. 
 

 My apartment is incredibly depressing due to clutter and the fact that i haven't even finished unpacking because i get overwhelmed and the idea of anyone, especially my family seeing it causes me to have an anxiety attack. 
 

 The only things I've managed to achieve the last week's are: occasionally doing my dishes but never to the point that my sink is empty. I took out the garbage at 4am because it was too stinky to sleep. I cleaned the toilet bowl because it was gross. And I've worked on crafts and art all my waking hours but I haven't actually finished a single thing. 
 

 Because I'll hyperfocus on making stuff I have no awareness of what time it is and often it'll be like 2am before I realize I should stop. Then I'll try to go to bed and either my brain won't shut up or my pain conditions will act up and so my sleep schedule is completely screwed now. 
 

 

 I feel like I need a personal assistant simply to remind me to do things and if I don't do them then to annoy me or pressure me until I do them. 
 

 Setting reminders on my devices doesn't work because I just instantly stop the alarms or swipe the notifications away thinking... in a minute and then it never gets done. A day planner doesn't work because I never remember to look at it or write stuff down. 
 

 I feel like I need an actual human to call me to check in periodically because then my brain will actually feel the pressure to do things because I hate disappointing people or feeling stupid etc. Ive tried therapy but I can't think about things I don't remember to think about. 
 

 Note: I am on ADHD medication and I'm at the highest dose I can afford which is 30mg and I'm also on anxiety/depression medications as well. 
 

 

  I want to start living. I'm 27 and I'm nowhere near where I wanted to be in my life. I haven't hung out with my best friend who lives in the city at all since moving here because I feel i don't deserve to be with her if my place is a mess. I haven't had the courage to go to the church by myself at all (I have anxiety about busses because I have zero sense of direction). The only social life I have is my parents picking me up for a weekend every so often to be with the family. I'm 27 and I'm morbidly obese and I've never been on a date or asked out. I feel like I'm running out of time to find a husband as the Christian young adult community is primarily married couples by my age. The only thing I don't feel pressure about is having biological children because I want to adopt someday. But I don't feel comfortable even trying to date until my weight is under control but who knows if that will even happen? I'm not a simple case when it comes to my weight, it's actually a complex medical situation so it's not an easy life change fix. I'm unemployed and I have no money to my name. I am not who I wanted to be and I feel like I'm going nowhere fast.
 

 I am a huge disappointment to myself and I know I'm a disappointment to my parents deep down but mostly they are just worried for me. I lived with them until this last year because I initially moved for a job opportunity that fell through because the boss was very abusive and I quit after 4 days. I want to move back home to have my parents hold me accountable and so I can be with my sweet pup whom gives me comfort but my parents want to me stay here to have better chances at finding a job...and they are covering all of my expenses that the disability benefits don't cover...which is squat, because I have zero money to my name. My life is in limbo, I feel like I'm just waiting for a diagnosis of a medical condition that'll kill me and that's the only change that could happen in my life at this point. 
 

 Does anyone have any suggestions? 
 

 Please help me."
"I apologize in advance for a lengthy history on my trauma but I’m just wondering if there’s anyone out there with problems like me. 
 

 I’m 26f and I’ve been struggling with severe anxiety and depression from a young age. Only recently diagnosed and you can guess why from the title. For years I’ve known this isn’t how I’m supposed to live. I constantly feel like I’m on high alert. I have high amounts of stress I can’t cope with (thanks unhealed childhood trauma) and I constantly just think everyone and everything would be better off without me. 
 

 I grew up in a strict religious household. I wasn’t allowed to have friends or be a kid. I had to raise my two siblings (now 17 and 16) and deal with a narcissistic mother who won’t get help “because there’s nothing wrong with her”. 
 

 I’m finding that it’s actually having super negative effects on me in my adult life. I’m more suicidal than I’ve ever been even though I’m seeking help. No, I know I won’t ever actually do it, but having those recurring thoughts are very hard. What happens if I’m not strong enough one of these times?
 

 Anyway. I recently moved away while I was seeking treatment and at first I was going to keep it a secret from my parents but they kept praying about why I wasn’t coming around and I just said “I’ve been going to therapy and trying to see if it helped” and I was met with “well why? You shouldn’t have anything wrong”. I’ve tried to tell them that even if I don’t count my shitty childhood, in 2019 I found my grandmother (who was more a mother to me than my actual birth giver) dead face down in her floor after she had had a heart attack. If that isn’t enough to hurt someone I don’t know what is. 
 

 Is it worth trying to get them in on my mental health journey or am I better off to just leave them out of it? I’m not even asking they acknowledge the fucked up things they did to me as a kid (beatings that left bruises after I made a simple childish mistake, telling me I should have been aborted because I was just such a difficult child to deal with etc). I want them to understand that I was probably just difficult because I was hurting and I didn’t know how to deal with myself. I know they probably don’t even deserve that explanation but I have two siblings they need to straighten up for or all of their kids are going to resent them and they’re running out of time. 
 

 Again, I’m sorry but I just feel so alone. I’ve met other people on my situation but they seem to just be happy with cutting their toxic parents off. I can’t seem to do that no matter how deserving they may be."
(27F) I hate being touched and finally after 3 long years I did it:-) I know it's not much but goddamn it I feel good now!
What to do when you get anxiety bouts every morning? I cry every morning and not like few drops of tears. It's full blown breakdown for no good reason. My chest feels heavy. It's like a ritual that I do before going to work otherwise I won't function. It's tiring and painful.
"Hi all. I just want to share on here because I have no one to talk to. 
 

 A little background, my husband (28M) and I (26F) are newlyweds and are teachers overseas and we currently teach in a country where only a few people can speak English. That’s why, it was extra challenging for us because of the language barrier, and the fact that we are away from our family and friends.
 

 Anyway, I have health anxiety and my husband seems fed up about my constant worries. Trigger warning to those with health anxiety like me, I’m going to describe a health-related symptom that led to our fight — I found a tiny black dot inside the cheeks of my mouth that look like a blood blister. Its very tiny but I just want to be sure since its my first time to encounter such thing. I was worried, but I tried my hardest to stay calm when I saw it while flossing. When I told him about it and showed him the blister, he already looked annoyed but still assured me that it was nothing, and then when I suggested to go to the doctor just to be sure, he then goes to reprimand me. Saying things like, “Ahhh, here we go again” or “Every month you have a new disease!”. Like, I know I can be a handful to deal with but this time, the symptom is apparent. I can see it. He can see it, too. I just want to know if this blister is normal. Now, I feel guilty opening up to him. It’s very frustrating. What should I do? 😭"
"Thought I was finally getting over my anxiety of public speaking when I hosted a 1.5 hour training session over Zoom for my team of 12 yesterday. 
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 This morning was my company's All Hands meeting and all I had to do was read about 30 seconds worth of updates from my department's slides to our company of 70 people on a Zoom call.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 I had practiced what I was going to say all of last night and this morning (our boss tells us the day before who will share the department update). 
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 10 minutes into the call and I started panicking so much when it came to my turn, something just took over me and I had to ask a colleague to take over as I had ""WiFi issues"" 😅

 I feel like I've let myself down so much, I'm not even sad. Just annoyed. 🤦"
"I (25M) have never been officially diagnosed with social anxiety, but it just kind of explains my behavior thoughout my whole life. Many thinkgs I look up about social anxiety mention pysical symptoms but I don't have those but I am still living behavioruly of social axneity. Now I just have these mental blocks where I just cannot will myself to do things that I am sure most people have no problem with. It feels like I am just kind of hit a wall and can't make myself do things that literally have no downside of me doign them... like phone calls, asking questions,. I definitely used to have physical symptoms when I was younger. I remember when I had to go summer school and it was at a different high school and I was be extremely nauseous all day and would be throwing up literally the time. I would also get really panicy and feel terrible and anxious for the first several months at my first job as a teenager as a cashier. I used to have such bad social anxiety when I was younger, where I could never order anything for myself, I could never ask a teacher a question, even as a teenager I just couldn't advocate for myself or ask anyone things. I'ma bit better in some ways as an adult.
 

 Now I don't have like any physical symptoms, and in general some of my fears that used to be paralyze me have gone away. My biggest fear used to be fear of authority especially, but maybe I just have a good boss and I don't feel that at all anymore. But in other parts of life I am just thwarted by this indescirble inablity and paralsis to do things, usually it seems when there is an unknown situationa and I fear other people will judge me or think of me as weird. I can't often do things that I need to do that are literally no problem for others. I often have to pre plan social situations for an long amount of time and I have to follow those steps otherwise I just feel this paralysis and totally unware of what to do... it's kind of ritualistic. I often have fears of how people think of me, like I am so afraid of people thinking I am stealing so I am constatly monitroing my behavior to make sure It doesn't appear that I am stealing... but I think this backfires because I've been accoused of shopliffing like three times though I have never stole anything. If I think someone catches me doing something that I may think they could judge me on, I will act like I am doing something else.
 

 One example is that when I was in grad school I was in a class in a building that I wasn't in much and it had a strange layout, and I had to pee very bad (I drink a lot of water), and Instead of just asking (because I can't ask people things like ever), or instead of just looking for it (I do not want people to think I am just wondering around for some reason), I just held it in until I got home (hour or so later) and was in extreme pain.
 

 It hurts to when It's something I have in which I have to advocate for myself in some way. I have an online doctor for ADHD medication managemtn and she told me some diffirent way to get refills in which I have to contact the online platform first instead of the pharamcy, and I was confused by this but I just couldnt ask for her to explain what I needed to do. Anyways, I have needed a refill for over a week now and it took me a week to build up the courage to call the pharamcy for them to tell me that they dont have the prescitipition... which I would have known if I just asked about that to my doctor, and my life has been a bit of a wreck without my medicine which I still don't have a prescitipion for.
 

 I don't really have any friends and my husband is the only person I talk to, so I am kind of lonely. I don't really have great social skills, and I usually annnoy people if they do become friends with me (...usually some adhd tangent.). every time It comes up I could like hang out with people and I just institicvely think of an excuse. I think i'd like friends but it's hard because I'm in a new area and don't know anyone and can't just put myseflk out there. I am pretty good in controlled situations, like at work I am actually really talkiitive, but if there is a meeting I am presenting on I get amazinzgly aware of how I a sound and treully scared of how they may think of me (I don't have great speaking skills and sometimes jumble up words and people sometyimes dont understand me well)."
"Hi everyone, I (F25) just constantly feel so anxious about the state of the world. One headline can change my whole day for the worse. I’ve done everything I can to distance myself from the news— I don’t watch it if I can help it (although I live with my parents who insist on watching it so I try to remove myself when they have it on), I disabled my computer news notifications and apps on my phone. I try to reason with myself that a) there’s nothing I can do about it and b) news outlets always hype things up, especially negative news, but it still always heightens my anxiety more than anything else. 
 

 I try to ground myself presently and use some techniques that my therapist taught me but it feels out of control. I also feel like there is huge privilege in being able to turn away from the news when other people can’t, so there’s also guilt there and feeling like I should “at least look at headlines sometimes” which always leads to more, even though I’m intentional about the news source I get it from and how much I read. I’m starting to feel really burnt out from this cycle and I just don’t know how to handle it? Can anyone else relate?"
"I’ve been feeling really low this whole week and I don’t know why. I’ve cried many times this week. I don’t want to be around anyone, honestly I don’t have many people around me and Im living in loneliness. I always feel so alone and I have no one to talk to. I don’t know ifs that’s the reason why I’m feeling this way"

 But today I’m noticing it more than usual. I mean it still feels the same as always but I don’t know if I’m thinking too much. I’m a very paranoid person so I always think of the worse case scenario.
 

 I don’t know if I should be concerned about this.
 

 I didn’t want to google it because google will say that I have some sort of cancer or I’m dying of some illness. 
 I once had a spot that seemed unfamiliar and I googled it, the results said it was a sign of cancer. I was so worried about it. Turns out it was a normal spot that went away in a couple of days. So I’ve decided not to trust google"

I also used to try so hard when I younger and people just didn't like me for it. I'm a very particular person I guess (I blame my Adhd) people like a mask of myself usually.
 

 

 I love the idea of having who are Essentially ""my tribe"" and am close with, but it just doesn't seem like reality. I definitely get jealous of people who have a lot of friends and they have similar hobbies and everything; i feel like I'm just not engineered that way to be as socially successful.
 

 Having friends also seems like literally just so much effort and matience and there fear of rejection over small things just is too much to deal with. 
 

 I was thinking how I don't really want to put all the effort to establishing friends and I also don't really want to anymore, and I think I should just stop trying because it doesn't seem like a good use of my time, and I think I just don't want to actually do it; it's just not a value in my life right now. I recently moved to to a new area that's a much bigger metro than I used to, and I only know my coworkers and my husband, so it's hard to really branch out anyways.
 

 And I'm just okay with this now, I think it's tiring to keep trying at something so futile and that because of social anxiety really just makes it often scary and hurtful for me.
 

 I'll just enjoy my time alone."

 Anxiety and Stress have probably been my best friends since my childhood and i am 27 (Male) now. Since i was in 2nd Grade i was constantly bullied till i was i reached senior high (in my Country it's called 12th grade), i was bullied because pf my religious belief and since then i have been dealing with issues of underconfidence, people who bullied me also included females so since then i have had issues talking to women and i am ashamed ti admit that it still plagues me,i have issues while interacting with women and i haven't been in any relationship at all in my life. My school never took bullying seriously and simply asked me to get used to .
 

 I did my engeneering in Mechnical and also did my MBA from a reputed institute but during my mechanical i had to move to a different state within my country and since my childhood i haven't had any friends so my parents are pretty much all i have and when i had to seperate and move i was so much stricken with anxiety and homesickness that not only did i habe have trouble sleeping and concentrating i had multiple breakdowns due to which i failed in 13 subjects during the entire course. 
 

 Coming to my current life i have issues with anxiety 24X7,i am obese as fuck since i don't feel like moving my body at all. Eating tends to provide me momentary relief so i do it a lot he ce my weight . There were 2 police raids at my place in last year one of which ended up with a family member of mine getting arrested, this further added to my fear and anxiety, unlike most people i know i just feel like sleeping all the time. Most of the hobbies i had in the past i don't feel like doing anymore, most of my weekends are spent on Netflix loops.
 

 I am financially pretty stable to be honest, i earn good and have a good chunk in my savings but i feel like all the enrgy and spark in my life is gone.
 

 The drive i once had in my life has vanished and there have been numerous instances in the past when i felt suicidal. I feel like going to the mountains and becoming a monk leaving everything in the world behind. Nothing excitesme anymore and on top of all of it my physical body is taking a hit . Everyday feels like a mix of anxiety and stress with huge icing of fear ,i get agitated on even smallest of things and overthing keeps kicking in hyperdrive"
Voice chat or video call don’t matter
"Hi everyone
 

 I'm 28M and I've had life long heavy anxiety (mainly due emotional neglect / not getting the safety and love from my parents that every child needs - they had their own issues and were unable to give me love &amp; safety). I've tried meds and therapy and still trying but the healing is going very very slow.
 

 I took a 0.5mg lorazepam yesterday as I wasn't coping with life (my psychiatrist originally gave me them for [emotional flashbacks](http://www.pete-walker.com/flashbackManagement.htm) )
 

 I haven't experienced the calmness the lorazepam gave me, in years. I literally can't remember a time in the last few years when I was so calm. I was shocked. My anxiety was just so calm. I'm planning to ask my psychiatrist to prescribe me them to take every day mainly for the anxiety.
 I know they can be addictive but at the moment I'm struggling with heavy anxiety, C-PTSD, emotional flashbacks, bouts of toilet related agoraphobia, ADHD (prob from trauma), suicidal thoughts, anhedonia etc, and I would def take the risk as i see it as the lesser of the 2 evils.
 

 Does anyone have experience taking lorazepam daily?
 Do they become less effective over time and would the dose then need to be increased?
 What's it like to be on it long term?
 

 Any advice appreciated
 

 Thanks
 

 P.s. Really impressed to see people on social media helping others, keep up your great work
 

 follow on: i went to see my psychiatrist today. he refused to allow me to take benzos daily, due to potential for addiction. this is despite my therapist telling him how suicidal and anxious the last month had been. I believe he wants to try all other non-addicting options before letting me try addicting options, or he is bound by law not to prescribe them daily (im in the UK) He told me i could either take them every 3 days (with a diff non-benzo anxiety med the other 2 days), or i could take them every day for a few days and then stop for a few days (taking non-benzo anxiety meds the other days, then continue the same cycle. trying now to take them every 3 days, so at least ill function somewhat every 3 days and i'll know on the other 2 days that i just need to wait to the 3rd day to be calm"
"I'm sure this has already been discussed and I know anxiety/panic attacks can make you shake or shiver. I was curious what it's like for y'all though. It's weird because my anxiety behaves different ways based on what the trigger is. Sometimes I have attacks that seem to completely bypass my brain and just trigger the uncontrollable physical symptoms of violent shivers and muscle tension and other times I feel extremely anxious but it triggers other symptoms(ones that are less noticeable from the outside like nausea, tight chest, etc that I can kind of mask around others).
 

 I bring this up because the past week I've actually been doing better. Then last night I began to feel a little tight chested(anxious). I ignored it and was trying to go to sleep when I had a little heart flutter. Granted I've had these before, was in the prime position for it to happen, had a little bit of what I thought was acid reflux, and it lasted only a few seconds(normal stuff). Idk what it was but immediately it triggered my body to start up the strong shivers. I would almost compare it to really bad muscle spasms as my body was acting like it was freezing. I didn't feel cold at all. I also didn't feel all that scared. I've had this feeling before during other anxiety/panic attacks so I knew that's likely what it was. Happened on and off for about 30-45 mins till it finally stopped leaving me feeling tight chested and a little tense. My heart beats were also more noticeable, little quick and strong(also typical for my anxiety). It's just kind of weird.
 

 Makes me wonder if different stress hormones cause different symptoms, like if adrenaline is more responsible for certain symptoms while cortisol is responsible for others and that's why it's kind of different sometimes. Or if somehow there's different channels anxiety uses to trigger symptoms and how it makes the decision to bypass the brain sometimes but not others."

"Hello. M27 here. 
 

 I’m on day 9 of Sertraline and recently (on day 7) upped my dose from 25mg to 50mg. I don’t seem to have any other side effect today other than the lump in throat. 
 

 It’s not deep in my throat but rather at the top, almost behind my tongue. It makes me have to swallow every 2 seconds and it only makes it more noticeable. I looked in my throat and if I relax my tongue enough I can see the top of my epiglottis. Could that be what I’m feeling? I’ve read it’s normal to see the tip and a few people can actually see their epiglottis even more. 
 

 I don’t have trouble talking, breathing, eating or drinking. I considered maybe it’s from acid reflux that people experience with Sertraline / Zoloft but Tums don’t really make it go away. My mouth and throat are also really dry which the sensation also feel like a dry spot in my throat but water doesn’t do too much. 
 

 Could it be just from anxiety from thinking about it too much? It’s driving me insane and it’s making me have more anxiety and panic attacks. It comes and goes and seems to be more noticeable when I think about it."
"Im a 26 yo male. Had many friends in the past. Wasnt bullied. But my friend group/family i made in highschool was fucking weird. Weird in a hilarious but completely socially unacceptable way. Anyway, in college to deal with trying to cope with SA and branch out a little bit, i picked up a drug habit. Which has lasted till now. I was 19 when i started school. 
 

 All my friends from college have now left to different cities and during covid all i did was sit for almost two years do drugs and isolate to quell my pain, my loneliness, my complete lack of connection. 
 

 Im now clean, and all of those feelings are back. And they hurt so terribly. Im overwhelmed. 
 

 I give off what i would call an insecure and or “off” vibe to a lot of people. With barely any interaction, just a couple exchanges, its an immediate turn off for people and i notice they avoid eye contact, begin avoiding me in general. 
 

 This is so fucked, im such a weird FUCK. I can be funny and interesting to myself a very select few people maybe. Most people… ie all people ive interacted with in person since ive been sober doing even try to fucking get to know me or care. 
 

 Idk. Idk what the fuck to do. Im pissed, im sad, im hurt and feel shame for letting myself go like that and not learning to interact with anyone sober or otherwise for all those years. 
 

 Ive always felt “crooked” or “broken” in some alien way. 
 

 I just want to have normal relationships. I want to have friends again. I want to love again if i ever really did. 
  
 How do i get through this. Ive been meditating twice daily, wim hoff breathing, yoga. All in my home but in an effort to see a greater perspective which i CAN see logically, but i dont feel it in my heart. Ik i need to put myself out there. I just dont have the dopamine or energy right now to do it. 
 

 On top of that. My years of drug abuse my have caught up to me. Ill know hopefully tuesday if ive developed a life threatening illness. —— to have gone through all ive been through, the hell of self destruction and the building my body mind and wellbeing back to some semblance of OK-ness.. all to have that ripped back out from underneath my feat from fucking cancer or lupus or whatever the fuck this is. GOD DAMN IT. 
 

 Sorry to vent. I just, idk, need some kind words or advice or just to simply know theres someone out there who knows from similar experience that Im gonna be alright and things will get better. The pot has boiled over and dag nabbit Im scared."
"They always say practice makes perfect, but not so much with SA. I've done so many presentations, whether at school or at work, and every time it feels like I'm dying and my entire body feels sick. It's just frustrating...It's also more frustrating to see work colleagues getting better and more confident at presenting, but I always remain anxious and tense myself."
"Had a conversation with my mother last night about taxes and how its a big deal she claims both of my children because her and her husband needs topay off their debts. Yes I live with them, yes they help provide for my kids since I don't work. But I feel that their debt isn't completely my problem I didn't cause that debt nor if I was here would I be here to help them so. 
 

 Now let me back up by saying both my parents are narcs and if they don't get there way they flip the absolute heck out and will spaz for days. So last year I claimed my daughter but my boyfriend was going to do it so I would guaranteed get my money but once I realized I would get more doing it on my own I filed by myself and that was terrible because once again they couldn't claim my daughter and they wanted to use her to pay there debt. They flipped out called me names hated my boyfriend and his mom ever since. So now that tax season is coming around its like there reminding me of the failure I've become of being a young parent of two and EVERYTHING they've had to do for me down to having a place for me to live. But there favorite saying foe my for my kids is ""they didn't ask to be here"" HELL I DIDN'T ASK TO BE HERE EITHER. Now my parents have 2 other kids but I'm the only one thats treated like this yes they nurture me and help but why can't that just be out of the kindness of their hearts why do I have to repay them? 
 

 My boyfriend wanted to claim his son (my other child) so he could pay a good portion off his car so we can have a good Christmas I guess and get out of the house (he lives with his grandma) but he can barley help provide for me and my kids now and I practically raise the kids alone throughout the week he see his son every Saturday or sunday (Daughter has a different dad) But I do the hard part alone doctors appointments, sick days, waking up 2:00 in the morning to feed the baby. all of that on my own and I feel as if I have to beg for money if he doesn't give his full amount of support (Not through the courts)
 

 

 I just feel like I have no one on my side thats truly here for me and everyone has left me once I wasn't benefiting them anymore I feel like my health is deteriorating my chest is constantly hurting I feel like inside I can die anyday now. I just wish I had genuine friends something I have No. One.

"Finally got enough courage to give this cute grocery store worker my number who I’ve caught checking me out multiple times when I’m shopping. He almost approached me first, but I could tell he got nervous so I decided to be brave and make the first move. People are always saying the best way to beat your social anxiety is to face your fears, but I instantly regretted it afterwards. I keep over analyzing ever little thing that happened. I feel like my nervousness made him more nervous, and it just felt like a big awkward mess. To make matters worse, he hasn’t even texted me. So, I’m pretty sure I blew any chance I might of had with him. This is just another thing to add to the list of things that this disorder has ruined for me. I’m a 28F and I feel like a child because I’m so inexperienced with dating and interacting with the opposite sex. I’ve always felt that being shy and nervous is unattractive to men. I was proud of myself at first for doing something WAY out of my comfort zone, but the more time that passes without him contacting me just reaffirms that taking risks when you have SA is a bad idea (at least in my case). Now I’m left with another embarrassing moment that will keep me up at night."
"I (27M) have been living with my parents since I finished college. I get along well with them, I pay rent, I cook dinner often, but I still feel like I’m in as strange place about it all.
 

 I’ve never had my own place (besides college dorm rooms), and it feels weird to tell people that I’m still in my parents’ attic. I’m grateful that I’m in a position where I can live at home, but I also don’t like being viewed as some kind of privileged millennial moocher. I also know plenty of people my age or younger than me who have moved out into their own houses or apartments, and it makes me feel like they’re moving ahead of me, and doing better than I am. I probably could get my own place, but the isolation factor would be really, really hard for me to deal with."
"I feel this constant frustration, combined with an obsessive overthinking that leads me to drop tears (not crying) but I feel without motivation, angry, sad, this is getting worse as I aged into a young adult. When I was a kid/teen I had a lot of activities I could just spare my time on, sports, videogames and stuff like that.
 

 

 But now, I'm 25 years old, after I graduated from the university in 2020, I've been actively trying to scape from my country, because I really hate being born here, my nationality makes it harder to do so (Colombia), add the pandemic, the new war and all the problems Worldwide, are turning this into a complete odissey, all of this make me feel as though my anxiety has been aggravated.
 

 

 I found a job here, I'm working from 6pm to 7am in the night shift in a hotel, the works get lighter from 12-4am, so this comes great to keep learning languages, and sometimes to recover some sleep because I have some annoying noisy neighbours putting music all aloud 24/7. 
 

 

 One big problem I found is the lack of responses from employers, nonprofit organizations, and other entities I have contacted. I've been trying sending endless messages to volunteering services, Au-Pair experiences, without luck and this is destroying my patience and my motivation. I'm constantly annoyed and although I have a big will, this constant overthinking is shrinking my inner peace.
 

 

 I don't know if I need an advice or I just needed to let off some steam. But still, this helps me to keep the perspective real and clear I won't allow myself to fall on depression.
 

 

 Anyway, thanks."

"This is one of my first reddit posts, so apologies if that doesn't make exact sense. I have had anxiety for most of my life and managed it to the point where it is mostly fine but gets debilitating/life affecting a couple times a year. Well, until recently. I started having anxiety attacks about a year ago. They seem to have no cause that I have found from tracking but they also aren't super often. My last one was in July before this one that happened Saturday. As usual I wake up in the middle of the night (typically between 2 and 4am) with chills/nausea/breathing problems/hyperventilating etc. Sometimes I will vomit and then dry heave when there is nothing left to expel. My care routine for these is Xanax and follow with buspar 10-25m later if needed.  
 

 Onto my advice/question... This last attack happened Saturday (early Sunday morning really 3 30am) - it is now Tuesday evening here. After the attack passes I typically have another hour or two before I can sleep again just it takes that long for my body to calm enough so I can actually fall asleep.  Then I will have the whole day ahead of that where I am nauseous and tired. My doctor has said this is typical for some people. If I'm not at my baseline by bed that following evening I will take a Xanax before bed then have always been fine after I slept the night. Well, here it is Tuesday and I cannot get this under control. I'm nauseous but eating small healthy meals, making sure I'm drinking water or something with slight sugar in it. My stomach is still in knots and nothing is helping. I've done my meditation, yoga, brisk walk, coloring, tv, video games, reading and while it may help for a bit it comes back the same.  It feels like right after the attack subsides where my body temperature isn't being controlled well (going hot to cold) and am so tired. I'm currently sitting wrapped in a blanket with a heating pad in a 75 degree house and shivering (I don't have a fever, checked 3 times) but an hour ago I was so warm my face and upper body were all flushed. Has anyone ever had symptoms of anxiety attacks last this long and what did you do? I'm so very much over this and starting to be anxious about my anxiety more and more which is definitely not helping.  Thanks in advance for the help/advice. It really is appreciated."
"Hi. (TW: mentions of domestic violence/ abuse)
 

 I'm new to this sub, I'm doing this on a different account because I don't want it linked to me. I don't have any friends or family I can really talk to about this so I thought I'd post here.
 

 I have dealt with anxiety for over 10 years now I think (I'm 26F). I had low level anxiety through my teens, and then I was in an abusive relationship (financial, physical, verbal and emotional abuse) in my early 20s that kind of made me spiral with anxiety. My current partner (26m) has been really supportive of me, and was patient with my irrational fears and triggers for the first few years whilst I dealt with my trauma.
 

 I've come a long way and would say I'm a lot less anxious now than I was 3-4 years ago. My partner and I have had a few arguments over the past year, and across these he's made comments about my anxiety when he's angry. He's said that my anxiety is ruining our relationship, ruining his life, impacting on his ability to make friends, and just negatively impacting his everyday life. Everytime he has said these things in an argument he's apologised and said he didn't mean it and that he just said it in the heat of the moment. I've tried to make efforts to be better in the areas that he gets frustrated with, but I just don't think I'm doing enough. 
 

 I'm not on medication anymore because it made me feel not myself, but during an argument today he said I should be medicated and getting more help and he's sick of something that is my problem impacting on his life. After the argument he said it does impact him (which was a first for him to say when he wasn't angry), but he wants to help me and he doesn't want me to bottle it up and deal with it on my own.
 

 For context the things he helps me with are coming shopping with me (I get stressed in busy areas and find it easier with someone else there- this happens 1-2 times a week), needing him to text me every hour or so when he's out at night with friends (like just an emoji or thumbs up to let me know he's ok), and helping me through anxiety attacks (he talks to me, sometimes rubs my back and helps me when I can't calm down) although I only have one every month or two now. He says there are other things but he can't remember them (I asked him to give me examples so I know what I need to fix). 
 

 I'm pretty sure I can fix the shopping one on my own, but the texting on nights out I will struggle with. I get really intrusive thoughts and find it hard to distract myself. I also don't know what to do with the panic attacks, I feel weird trying to hide it from him. I had one in the shower after our argument and he said he could hear me crying. 
 

 Any advice would be really appreciated from anyone else who has anxiety that impacts their partner."
"Hi all, I’m apologize ahead of time if this is wordy.
 

 So I (25f) have experienced pretty bad brain fog ever since I was about 8 and had to start learning multiplication tables. It specifically hits either when I’m in a stressful conversation and need to recall memories, or I’m trying to work (I’m a programmer). I never have this issue when I’m programming personal projects or researching something I’m passionate about, so I thought maybe it was ADHD. My psychiatrist diagnosed me with it after I mentioned it, but the process was reaaaaally relaxed and he didn’t question me too much. He just threw Adderall at me. It’s helped and I’ve noticed I’m a lot less anxious now, but I can’t imagine ADHD is the issue if my fog is mostly only present when I’m stressed, and I am not impulsive (unless I’m unhappy), impatient, hyperactive, etc ..
 

 How it feels:
 When my brain fog hits, I mainly feel like I have zero memory, short or long-term, and when I’m trying to listen to someone talk, I lose context for what they’re talking about, mid-sentence. As for problem solving, you can forget that entirely. I also get *unreasonably* tired and my eyes feel swollen as soon as the fog sets in. I’ve also noticed that for the last several months, I‘ve had pretty intense muscle tension in my forehead, jaw clenching, trouble staying asleep, and I’ve gotten menstrual cramps + intense lower abdominal swelling after eating anything at all, even when I’m not anywhere near my period.
 

 I thought maybe it was just dehydration or a food allergy but I’ve tried drinking water + elimination diets, and neither have done anything for me.
  
 I definitely have deadline/test anxiety, because it nearly made me fail a few college courses. I know for sure that when I don’t know the solution off the top of my head, or I have to solve a large problem and I know it’s due in a week or a month, I get really foggy. Taking walks helps but that’s not enough by any means.
 

 So huh, maybe all of this is anxiety?? What do y’all think? Does anyone have tips specifically for easing the fog without Adderall?
 

 Edit: added symptoms"
"Does anyone else get sensations for a few seconds where feels like blood has left body like a flushed feeling then a bit of dizziness and heart beats faster?
 

 Had a few of these today and it's really freaking me out that my heart is going to stop or something."
"I (25M) had undiagnosed moderate anxiety since I was a child, but it was manageable and didn’t interfere with my life much, I was able to get up and go to work or school, but 6 months ago it turned into severe Hypochondria, GAD, Panic Disorder and DPDR Disorder.
 

 **This is going to be a long one, feel free to skip to the summary section where I share what I think helped me ease my anxiety, and I hope it helps you too.**
 

 But my anxiety always ramped up whenever I faced a problem I couldn’t solve, it just ramps up to the point of obsession and insanity sometimes, I don’t sleep, I withdraw socially and I stop going to work sometimes, but that was still not the peak of it.
 

 My story started 6 months ago, when I was driving home in a pretty relaxed mood, when suddenly I felt this extreme dizziness and vertigo, I managed to get home, and as soon as I got home it was somewhat relieved, then I felt it again in the shower, and then my panic kicked in, I had the worst panic attack of my life (seemingly out of nowhere since I didn’t have one in years), I went to the hospital my tests were fine but one marker was elevated which was CRP (inflammation) and this got me going crazy, and this is how my health anxiety started, I went to 17 different doctors in the span of 6 weeks, all of them said I was fine, but I wasn’t, I didn’t feel like I was, it sure started with dizziness but now I have headaches, neck pain, shaky hands, insomnia, electrical jolts throughout my body (now I know it was brain zaps), and 2-3 panic attacks per week, so that didn’t convince me, then one day I went to an orthopedic, he said I had inflamed nick muscles, that’s what’s causing my neck pain, dizziness and elevated CRP, I felt relief and felt great, and I thought I was past this, I was okay, but then, depersonalization hit me, and I had a massive panic attack (worst than the previous ones), and I realized that I have anxiety.
 

 I went to a psychiatrist, told her my story, and she freaked me out even more, she asked me if I heard voices, and claimed I may have early schizophrenia (because of the depersonalization), so I went to a different one and was diagnosed with health anxiety (hypochondria), GAD, Panic disorder, and DPDR disorder, I started therapy, and wanted to give it a shot before starting medication, but things got much worse before it improved, I got to the point where I haven’t left my room in weeks, I thought I was gonna get worse mentally, develop other conditions like schizophrenia, psychosis, I had philosophical questions that made me panic (dpdr did not help), and extremely irrational fears about how my body works, how I can even move my arms and legs, but it got better and the first thing that improved was panic attacks, and then slowly with the help of some supplements I started to get a grip over my anxiety and haven’t had a panic attack in 3 months.
 

 

 

 **Summary**
 

 I realized the root causes of my anxiety as the following:
 

 - A stressed out body
 - Assuming the worst outcome
 - Rumination
 

 And my psychiatrist showed me a study about how people with less stressed bodies (measured by their Heart Rate Variability) are virtually immune to anxiety, so the first thing I did was:
 

 - I set a fixed sleep and wake schedule that I stuck to religiously (with the help of Chamomile, Magnesium and Skullcap I managed to sleep)
 

 - I decided I would walk 40 minutes a day everyday, and do moderate workout for 30 minutes 3x/week
 

 - Cut out sugar, and some carbs except for fruits, and stuck to eating at fixed times everyday.
 

 - Yoga Nidra for 20 minutes after work.
 

 And this helped me ruminate less, but assuming the worse outcome was still a part of my personality.
 

 So I learned a couple of techniques from my therapist that I’m sure most of us know.
 

 - Journaling (I would document thoughts, my feelings, and my expectations), then revisit the journal at the end of the day and write why I thought those thoughts.
 

 - gratitude training (it helped me train my mind to focus on positive things, not assume the worst)
 

 - mindfulness (it helped me observe my thoughts better, and spot any flaws in my thinking and assumptions)
 

 And this helped me manage my anxiety from being always on the verge of panic (8-9/10) to (2-5/10) throughout the day.
 

 I know it’s not perfect, but it’s manageable now, and I still have a long way ahead.
 

 

 **And for those of us who decided to go the no meds route, I used these supplements and they helped me**
 

 * Chamomile and Skullcap for sleep
 * 2.5 grams of Omega 3*
 * Magnesium L-threonate (2gs x2 a day)* tons of studies on how they block NDMA (fear)
 * L-theanine*
 * Taurine 1000mg (once a day)* also tons of studies on how they block fear
 

 *I suggest speaking with a doctor before consuming these supplements.
 

 I know this may not work for everyone and maybe some of us don’t have it this simple, but I hope this can help you, and I wish you all well and one day we’ll all recover from this, or at least control it to the point where we can live healthy happy lives!

"hello all! so about 2 years ago i was prescribed Wellbutrin and Celexa, helped a little with depression but was not useful for my anxiety, i’ve since been prescribed Vistaril, Buspirone and propranolol. on top of those 5 i also take Adderall as i have crippling executive function disorder and it helps tremendously with day to day tasks. Unfortunately i still regularly get panic attacks so was ultimately given a low prescription of Xanax. Not something i wanna rely on but it’s been very helpful in times of crisis when i feel the panic coming. I also take Ashwaganda as i know it’s a natural remedy for stress. but at the end of the day i’m still sad and still anxious. i’m only 25 and this feels like a lot of medication to be taking. my doctor tells me to just stick with it and that’s what i’ve been doing! not planning on getting off any of these without talking to my doctor but i’m just so curious if others have been down the road of having every pill thrown their way to no avail. it’s been months, is it just a waiting game?"
"I am in a seriously rough spot. Lost my job and am facing a criminal case because I had my first completely dissociative episode while at work about a week and a half ago. I’m desperately trying to find a professional who can actually help me. 
 

 All I want to do right now is leave my apartment and go to the gym for a little bit, even just a walk on the treadmill would be good. I have been afraid to drive since my episode and even though my gym is only 10mins away I get INTENSE anxiety every time I try to leave and I end up just curling up on the couch. I could really use some words of encouragement."
"I'm 25 and got my license this year. Passed on the first try. I'm fine with driving around my small town alone. I have had this phobia of driving for years. When I first started my whole body would tense up and it would feel hard to breathe. Now after a lot of time and practice that doesn't happen but I still am not ready to drive that far alone. I hate the highway. I wish I lived somewhere in more in nature not in a clusterfuck of capitalism. But.
 

 My roommates are moving soon and I can't keep paying this rent all by myself. I've been getting rides from parents going the same way to work and back and I've been practicing driving to work on the highway with one of the roommates. I'm very thankful for all their help but I know they're getting impatient. I'm getting impatient and mad at myself too now. I wish it came naturally to me like most people. I feel like nobody in my life really understands. I feel like such a burden and I want independence. I'm trying so hard but I just am overwhelmed.
 

 Another odd thing I just wanted to add ;
 

 I used to have frequent dreams of peacefully driving around by myself, usually at night. Once I started actually driving they slowly stopped. I do kinda like driving when it's dark on not busy roads though. Other than that idk what this means."
"I'm 28 and from the UK. I never needed to drive because I'm from a very walkable town with good bus connections, but I recently moved to a village and as a result I'm going to need to get my licence sorted.
 

 I passed my theory in August 2021, and took about 10 hours of lessons shortly afterwards, but then had a lot going on including two moves in the space of six months so it kind of fell off the radar. I'm back at it now with my fourth (in this stint) weekly two-hour lesson tomorrow. I'm doing well and improving nicely, but I can't get over this dread that builds in the days and hours before I have to get in that car.
 

 Any tips? Will this pass?"
"I’m a bridesmaid in my best friends wedding tomorrow and I’m an emotional person. And it makes me so anxious. 
 

 I literally saw her last night at the rehearsal dinner and cried. I cried during the rehearsal. I cried during the speeches. 
 

 I don’t want to cry during the ceremony tomorrow and be distracting from the bride and groom. I don’t want to ruin my make up. 
 

 Please don’t say “just let it out - it’s nice, lots of people will be crying, it’s normal”. My crying is excessive and was an ongoing joke at my sisters wedding because it was too much. 
 

 Do you have any tips to stop the tears when you feel it coming?"
"I need help. I feel like I’m suffocating. (28F) I met a guy in April and have been seeing him ever since. Things got a bit more serious within the last few months (august-ish). He’s such a good guy, who loves me very much. I honestly think he loves me more than anyone I’ve ever met, he worships me 🥺 However, he seems to be triggering my trauma and anxiety. I had my very first panic attack with him a month ago resulting me going to the ER, we were literally just watching a movie and it came out of NO WHERE. My daily anxiety since then has been unbearable! 
 

 Past relationships have triggered the same anxiety, but it’s 1000 times worse with this relationship. 
 

 I start EMDR therapy on Wednesday. And started lexapro yesterday, but I had such a severe reaction to the first dose that my doctor made me stop taking it already. 
 

 I’m constantly on edge and a nervous wreck and it’s all triggered by him. Any advice on what to do?? He doesn’t deserve me treating him like this, I feel like I’m pushing him away."
"So my (27f) boyfriend (30m) and I have been dating for 6 months. He started having panic attacks in 2020, then he took anxiety medications for 6 months and stopped them a month ago. Anyways, he forgets a lot of what we’ve said, I would reference something we talked about 2 days ago and he wouldn’t remember until i make an effort to remind him. Recently he did something and was afraid that i was mad about it, so he apologized the day after and I told him it was fine i wasn’t upset. 2 days later he apologized again, I told him you already apologized, he said that he doesn’t remember. That was odd to me. So I want to know is it normal to be that forgetful if you have anxiety? (Btw most of our conversations are through the phone, we’ve only had 5 dates due to the distance)"
"I've been really anxious lately because of a recent career change, plus the additional responsibility I've taken on that involves working at my old place of employment on occasion during the weekends. 
 

 

 I'm worried because the primary job I am moving into was described as ""fast-paced"" and I get very tense when I think about the potential increase in stress... I'm worried about my heart and having poor health because of that potentially stressful new job AND the additional shift that I am tasked with picking up on occasion.  
 

 

 It feels like a lot of stress, especially since I already have been dealing with constant thoughts about my health and feeling certain I will die... my thoughts and anxiety have changed and now seem to focus on the potential stress being too much for me to deal with... I'm 25, it's been hard to sleep because my thoughts kind of go on and on at times during the night and I don't know how to shake my worries :("
"I thought that I find the best thing ever, uni that heavily uses Internet and e-learning methods in it's history course. 
 

 We have one weekend of classes a month at the uni, the rest is on a platform. There's a lot of work, a lot of assignments to do every day, but after initial panic I managed to do most of them (apparently beside a Latin assignment due today)
 

 Unfortunately, today after ancient history classes, my anxiety went up so much, I feel like resigning. Most people here already studied at uni, or at least tried to, or are younger than me. 
 

 I have no idea what to do. I'm lightheaded with worry, my hands shake - is it a panic attack btw?"
"I tried my best, but today I got a few panic attacks in classes, and also a realisation - I don't see myself in that field. Also it's pretty expensive for my country's standards. I don't see anything keeping me there. 
 

 Only the people closest to me know I've been accepted to uni, but I'm still worried they'll be angry at me. 
 

 I paid for it on my own, but still... I'm worried I'll disappoint them. The course was intensive af, and even on my current health leave from work (related to, no surprise here, my anxiety flaring up badly) I couldn't manage. 
 

 I feel like a failure. I'm worried that my family will panic that once more I'll stay at home, and regress - but is being in chronic stress better than that? I feel like I'm regressing right now, I'm feeling worse and worse, thinking about suicide, and how worthless I am that I can't keep up. 
 

 I needed to vent but also... idk, hear that I'm not a failure, I guess. That it's not the end of the world."

"I've posted a few times in this sub, but only complaining out of frustration. I don't know if anyone would care about what I'm about to tell but I'm tired of hiding it while it keeps annoying me inside my head.
 

 It's totally fine if you don't wanna read this since it will be a long story. But maybe, just maybe, someone can relate or feel identified and feel comforted.
 

 My story with social anxiety begins with a child that was starting to live conscious of it's existence at 6-7yo. But one day a man (a family relative) who was very sick on his head, attacked my mother during a red light while driving after psychologically and physically torturing my family members for years. They both fought, one just for the sake of doing damage and the other for protecting a kid that was inside the family car (me). Between pushing and slaps, punches etc, I see how my mother collides against the window I was looking all the fight. I never was the same kid since that moment.
 

 That made that kid stay in shock for 4 years. Having a severe stuttering problem because of the trauma and I just couldn't get too away from my mother. Nightmares, anxiety, and fear to go outside was my everyday life.
 

 I've been talking about myself in third person all this time couse my brain deleted all my memories before and during that shock state. And recall that kid as myself makes me dissociate. When my family talks about the past or when they show me a picture of myself when I was a kid... I don't recognize that person. Because I don't remember myself in that place, in that house, with those toys, whatever.
 

 During those years of shock I went to primary school. I was bullied for stuttering and made me become extremely shy and quiet. The bullying continued until I had to move to the other side of the planet for personal and familiar reasons, trying to find more quality of life there. 
 

 In high school, when you spend your years as a teenager and you start meeting new people and whatever, I was also bullied but heavier. There were dangerous gypsies in that school that made my life impossible, along with other boys and girls that also bullied me for multiple reasons (stuttering, being fat, etc) humiliating and insulting me, hitting me, getting home with bruises in my body, my school materials being stolen or hidden, being threatened with knives and more. I was so depressed I repeated some years inside that hell of a place. My confidence was broken, everyone knew me as the kid that stutters and you should make fun of him. Total isolation from students to teachers. I couldn't talk or make almost any friend, since my friends also were bullied a bit for being my friends. I had a girlfriend who wasn't specially beautiful and the bullying worsened, we had to end the relationship because none of us resisted the pain it was causing us. My parents were worried but the school never did anything and I had to move to another school (11 to 18yo).
 

 Then in my last years of high school (in a different school). We jump from 18 to 22yo I met new people, they were more respectful and I didn't receive bullying there... But the damage was already done. I received more respect there but I was always lonely, as my friends were in a higher grade than me all the time. It ended with a person without any social skills and always quiet. Not wanting to study and I was in some kind of ""silenced depression"" I didn't notice until I dropped school.
 

 Lost in life and hopeless, I had a girlfriend. My first serious relationship. Lasted one year until my father ruined it by controlling and manipulating both of us and prohibiting me having sexual activities with her (I was very responsible with that topic btw) just to find out that she was cheating on me. Confidence even more broken and falling into depression again for a whole year.
 

 Then I met another girl. It lasted almost three years and she was greedy af with our relationship. I gave everything of me to her and more. I did my 200% and did many favors to her. Just to be mentally abused by her greed, specially in sex terms. She made me feel useless on bed and always creating a new drama between us. Today what I realize is that she was blaming me for her past traumas and being selfish and stubborn to not trying to find professional help, a psychologist. Then she left me and when she realized how good I was, after doing men after our relationship she realized what I was actually giving her (no sexual stuff included) the amount of love and attention that nobody was willing to give her and she asked me to be a couple again. I refused and kicked that person from my life in that moment. Confidence broken, more traumas added to the list and new achievement unlocked ""sexual traumas"". Until today I feel total rejection, fear and -100 self confidence in and out of sexual topics.
 

 A couple of years passed and I finally studied something and loved myself a little more. I lost 23 kilos in a healthy way and I thought I was cured of all the suffering. Ooh boy, if I knew what was coming...
 

 Years passed and we go to late 2018-early 2019. When I discovered VRchat and started socializing more... I realized that something was a little off. For some reason I couldn't talk among groups of people, I started sweating cold, blushing, stuttering in every word I say and lack of air in my lungs, heartbeat rising to the sky and panic... I realized I had social anxiety. Not by myself tho, I realized thanks to a friend I made in VRchat that I treasure today with all my heart.
 

 I also had bad experiences playing that game. Many people don't behave the way they would irl. For example suddenly spawning sexual toys in front of you without asking or being touched in places nobody would irl or shoving phallic objects up my mouth, obviously triggering my traumas to the max. And no I'm not saying everyone there is like that. But God I was unlucky...
 

 I went down, down and down. No breaks. Next stop: the void, the black hole, I went through event horizon and beyond. That was the moment I touched the bottom and I don't want to talk about it.
 

 Covid and the stress from my father almost dying from it and being in ICU for three months helped me to worsen the problem. Reaching the moment I went away from my friends and stood alone all the time.
 

 We arrive to last year, 2021. When I told my mother for the first time I was having all this issues and social anxiety. She was devastated. She saw that I wasn't the calculative, strong person she thought I was (oh and also that I was bisexual). I'm lucky I received support from her and some other family members but not from my father, never had a good relationship with him anyways.
 

 I decided to go to a psychologist. Anti depressives and rollercoaster of emotions are my daily life now. I was lucky I got to recover contact with my friends and I improved a little bit in this 2022. But this is not the end nor the happy ending of overcome your fears. I still live in constant stress, fear and desperately looking for solutions (also a job). I have so much to do to improve on myself and yet so less strength left. But I use the strength I don't believe I have to keep fighting. Everything is scary as I'm typing this words with tears running on my cheeks.
 

 I don't know if this will ever end but I can't surrender like I did once."
"This year has been a pretty rough one. A lot of ups and downs with what to do with my life, and I don't want to bring it into next year.
 

 I am currently working at a gas station, and while it isn't a difficult job, I hate working with the general public. Its degrading and people treat me like im trash because of my job. Having over a dozen jobs in the past year ( from food service to hotels, pest control, and construction) none seem to do it for me. To cope, I drink every night until I'm ""satisfied( sixer every night)"" and don't do any of the old activities I've come to enjoy ( nature walks, working out, etc.). I want out, and I am set to return to school on Monday, yet have no motivation or drive to finish my degree.
 

 I yearn to travel nomadically, but don't feel the same sense of completeness that I do with finishing what I started academically, ideally. I feel that being a nomad is yet another cop-out, another interest that I have, put in front of my original goal as justification for not finishing school. But the thought feels so liberating and exciting. Meeting new people( I have no friends), having a less stressful life, and finally being able to move out of my parent's house, can all be done within a year to this day if I pursue it seriously. All of the content I watch is Overlanding and nomadding and it is very reachable. It will be a great experience for a few years and I feel that I won't regret it if I commit to it.
 

 I have 48 credits until I complete my BA in political science and the field brings stimulation to me that I cannot describe. It's a clusterfuck right now with polarization but I want to look beyond this contemporary bullshit and focus on what we can be decades from now. $15,360 and about two years is what it will take to finish. The degree will just be a major accomplishment and a box I can check that has brought me tears, anger, and feeling of being inadequate, which can be put to rest. From there I can find jobs outside the service industry and at least be in a better position financially as the years go on. To add, the work I envision myself doing will be meaningful and contribute to a larger discussion/movement that will feed into what government will be like in the future. My experience in the field has been intimidating and challenging yet I welcome it. I have even considered moving to a different state when I'm done with a fresh start, as I have a lot of local political experience that I enjoyed.
 

 At 25, the societal pressure I feel to just move out and live my unique life is getting to me. I just want to pick something without regretting my decision constantly, and both have caused me to do so. Im drunk rn, and if anyone has read to this point I appreciate it. A little feedback is all I want, as I cannot figure anything out myself atm."
"I've always had strong and strange reactions to drugs and medication. SSRIs made me feel like I was melting and when I stopped moving after walking, I felt like I was still going forward for half a second. Weed seems to have given me this anxiety disorder and I had hallucinations of people besides me during my first use, besides that weed always gave me strange reactions to even the smallest amount. At the dentist, I was given adrenaline to help stop bleeding during a cavity drilling, but they dentists took the IV out before I even noticed my body was twitching (had a panic attack after that).
 

 I'm scared to try this anxiety medication I've been recommended, especially considering its stimulating effects. What's the likely hood of this stuff doing that? I really don't want to suffer though another drug induced panic episode."
"I think I’ve been isolating for way too long and don’t know how to talk to people, hold conversations, make friends, etc. anymore. I mean I was never really an expert at any of that, but I at least had some type of life outside of my family/household. However, lately it seems that the only other people I interact with are the ones I live with, which is depressing as hell. 
 

 Personally, I’ve always had social anxiety to some degree for most of my life but now I’m finding that it’s negatively impacting my professional life now too. I am terrified of going back to work due to the anxiety of having to meet new co-workers and interact with them. It’s been so anxiety provoking that I’ve been out of work for a year (while also recovering from a traumatic experience). Anyway, I’m trying to push myself into starting to apply for jobs. I figured that I just have to face it. Plus, I’m dying to get back onto my own feet and back into my own place. I want my own life and friends again. It’s just I have no where/how to start. 
 

 Throughout this whole process all I’ve wanted is some kind of guide for how to talk to people again. I feel like I don’t know what to say anytime another person talks to me. I just want some instructions like If they say X, then I say Y. I end up panicking and ending nearly every conversation I have aside from meaningless small talk. It seems I really only get anxious talking to people that I know I will have a continued relationship with like co-workers, acquaintances, friends, etc. Anyone have any tips on how to get back out there personally and professionally?"
"Do I love her? Why am I so uncertain? Why do I feel like running often? 
 

 Our relationship had a lot of toxicity, some of it has gone some didn't. It also has a good side. 
 

 I am not sure I want kids. I am 29m and she is 28f and I don't want to think about kids already. She always pressured me a bit in a relationship with a bit of being offended easily or making me feeling guilty because I haven't kissed her in public. 
 

 I haven't lived a real honeymoon phase with her because I was too anxious and she was too insecure. But even before with other relationships even the bad ones I alwaya had the honeymoon phase. We have been mostly fought and since the beginning everything waa so strange 
 

 

 I want to run but I don't know if it is the right thing. Then I feel sorry for her and it seems too difficult. Then I feel like I'm already old and I will lose one of the best chances of life. But then if we talk about anything I see we are not really compatible mentally, but then I feel a sort of familiarity which I don't understand it is so confusingthen i think i may hurt her hearth and I can't accept that. 
 

 I also think abou how my past relationship were shit and I alwaya dated the very wrong people. It is true that I was unlucky and i needed a therapist, but still.
 

 I also find very hard to depict all of this in one post"
Hello all! I’m going for my intake here in a couple hours and I’m super nervous. I haven’t ever been allowed to get mental health help so I am a little scared. (My parents don’t believe in mental illness and I’ve been on their insurance until a couple months ago) is it normal to be nervous? I have some sh scars from a couple weeks ago. Should I keep that to myself? Or should I be open?
"Hello everyone. I am a 30 year old woman who is just hopeful and hopeless at the same time. Battling with my mind every single day trying to tell myself to push myself to feel good about the future and believe this torment will be over.
 

 I have been going through a very odd form of social anxiety where I can order food from anywhere without any problems I could speak to strangers but when it comes to my boyfriend, sisters and close ones I am terrified.
 

 I was fixing that problem with alcohol about 3 years ago where it got me to a point where I couldn’t stop it anymore. Thankfully a health scare forced me to face my fears and deal with social situations sober. 
 

 The anxiety still hasn’t left and I am so tired and exhausted with everything. I am bored. I want to have fun. I ended things with my boyfriend so I should call him ex but I still talk to him. I ended things with him because it has been 10 years of relationship practically begging for a ring for the past 3 years. 
 

 I feel like everyone else around of course they have problems but not like I do. People get to go out and socialize normally and live life limitless. I have a job thankfully where I work alone but I do not know if it makes it worse. I miss being social. I can’t enjoy a night out with friends I only have one and in order to hang out I need to get drunk to not get anxious or a panic attack. I don’t want to get drunk anymore but last time I went to a party sober where everyone knows me as the loud funny one and I shut down in panic I couldn’t handle it so I drank. My face gets frozen and I can see in peoples eyes they notice and it is so humiliating and embarrassing. I wouldn’t wish this on my own enemy.
 

 I want to be better. Do better but everything in my life that is ruining it I have no control over. I also found out I am prediabetic to make matters worse. 
 I am in my 30s with no kids and time is running out.
 

 

 I feel like if in 3 years things do not get better, will have to end it. I do not want to but living this way is painful and so sick of it"

"28(F)
 Whenever I have a panic attack I get nauseous, that’s how it’s always been and because of that I developed emetophobia when I was 9. 
 Fast forward to now, whenever I feel nauseous I instantly have heightened anxiety and eventually a panic attack. Well last week my doctor prescribed me Ozempic for weight gain that was related to my anti anxiety medications. After speaking to my psychiatrist about it she said it was a great idea and safe for me to take since it wouldn’t effect any of my other medications. Little did I know the biggest side effect is nausea. I worked really hard to finally get on this medication, I can’t just give up. Even if I wanted to, it’s in my system for a week. 
 I don’t know how to feel better about this. Nausea causes my anxiety to get high, then I get nauseous from the anxiety that it gives me and over and over again. 
 Advice would be appreciated!"
Can stress and anxiety make you feel constantly bloated/tight abdomen? It's weird. I don't have diarrhea nor nausea
"Hello.
 

 I have been diagnosed with Anxiety and im on medication. I'm 25 years old. Long story short, lately i have hearth palpitations i have been to a doctor EKG and everything, and it seems to be all good.
 

 The problem is that sometimes my skipped beats are with a pain and I'm stressed out about it, I also had one episode of skipped beat i had a feeling like someone is squeezing my heart two times...
 

 Anyone else had similar symptoms (heart squeezing or heart palpitation with pain from a time to time)?"
"Everyday now I wake up, usually nightmares and waking up in a panic but I quickly calm down from. But 1 or 2 hours after waking I become very anxious and have to spend the next 4 hours stopping myself from having a panic attack. So far, I have not had an actual trembling terrible panic episode with only brief moments feeling like its going to be. But its still miserable and today was perhaps the worst. I'm also worried I could have a real episode.
 

 I just got my sleep schedule back on track, and this got better, but its quickly getting bad again. I've also been kinda able to pinpoint a reason I'm getting anxious around this time. One of which was just thinking about how people always thought of me as weird, and just that made me real anxious. But today I'm not sure what caused it. The only things I can think of where how politics get into my meme feed easily and I get REALY mad at some of the things I see. I general for the past few years I've been at home without seeing people outside my age, I have been getting much angrier much easer and brood sometimes constantly. Can this kind of constant stress/anger create panic episodes even if you stopped thinking about them?"
"Over this past year I've been getting really upset with politics and stuff. I'm also thinking lots about my past and how unfulfilled I felt. Just brooding every single day over things since I live at my parents and never leave the property. Often I switch between selfless thoughts of the whole worlds suffering and injustice, to then be angry about petty things like letting somebody talk down to me years ago.
 

 Can this create anxiety even when I'm not thinking about it anymore?
 

 EDIT: My anxiety is becoming terrible again despite fixing my sleep schedule, I wonder if this is a main contributor."
"Hello everyone (again),
 

 I'm writing this because I've read almost everything in Google at this point and I can't be helped. Or I can't help myself. I'm currently in a relationship, fairly new. We've known each other for three months and made it official 2 weeks ago. This is my third relationship. Just a bit of context: my second relationship, my last one, was really complicated. I was with someone narcissistic who really ruined a bit of me. I already had fear of abandonment but it got worse as, after 2 years of dating, he said I love you in the night and the morning after told me ""I don't love you anymore."" WHILE WE WERE ON VACATION, BOTH OF US, IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. After a few realizations I told my therapist I suffered a bit of narcissistic abuse and I think I have a bit of PTSD.
 

 Now I've met this guy, after 10 months of me and my ex broke up, and it has been amazing. He's the kindest human being I know. He's very honest (it seems - because my mind keeps telling me he's lying) and super nice and always makes sure he reassures me whenever I'm anxious, sad, or scared. It was really difficult in the beginning to even give him a bit of me and be vulnerable. But now that I've put my walls down so many fears are overcoming my head. I have this fear that his ex will come and ruin the relationship, begging him to come back (I have talked to him about this and he has said that they ended because it was HORRIBLE at the end and both knew it didn't work anymore. And we had a very mature conversation where he said that he wants to be with me that's why he wants to be in a relationship, to begin with, because if he wanted her he wouldn't even be meeting people let alone be in a relationship. The past is in the past and now I'm who's important to him). I'm really scared of that because in the past an ex was more important than me. Then I'm terrified he will stop liking me because I'm a very anxious person. The bottom of the question is that I'm terrified of hurting myself and looking ridiculous for giving someone a chance and breaking up a month after for example. And the more kind and warm he is to me every time I am like this, the more scared and ashamed I become.
 

 And I know, if I'm here is because I know he likes me and I like him and if I accepted to be in a relationship I should just believe 100% in the person I'm in and hope for a bright future. But as I said I keep making scenarios every day and starting to get anxious and I can't keep asking for reassurance. I need strategies. (Yes I'm in therapy!)
 

 Do you have any advice? Kind words? Strategies? A SLAP IN THE FACE FOR ME TO STOP SPIRALING."
"Hi y’all,
 

 I’ve (M25) been an anxious mess with GAD since I was 5 and it’s triggered by big life changes (I.e. new schools, moving states, starts of a new semester or starting a new job).
 I recently made the decision to quit my most recent job working in higher ed as the sudden changes from January 2022 lead to it becoming a toxic and unreasonable work environment that was just making me anxious EVERY day to the point of just wishing I would be fired.
 I left with all the confidence in the world but without anything lined up. I live with family and have about 6 months worth of savings so I figured I’d be ok. I’ve only been out of work 2 weeks and I’m miserable, hardly sleeping and each rejection letter is bogging me down so hard that I just want to give up and curl in a ball…
 I’ve put out almost 50 apps and have had only 2 interviews, 1 of which didn’t go anywhere and the other I got as far as a reference check after two interviews and just yesterday found out I didn’t get it…
 I hate this, I hate how one day my brain is logical and knows what needs to be done and then the next I’m just in my own head and trembling from the anxiety of feeling worthless for not being employed."
"I have been working in a very extroverted company for 1 year now and it is not good for my mental health at all. I told myself to quit at the end of this year, but my biggest fear is the attention I will get. I'm not so afraid of the resignation itself, but of the 4-week notice period during which I'm still supposed to work. It is usually announced in company and team meetings that you are leaving and of course it is expected that you organise leaving drinks etc. How can I do this when I fear being the centre of attention? Collueages that left in the past where all so open and normal about it. I put so much pressure and fear on myself that I have been staying longer in this company than it was good for me. I'm so afraid of my colleagues asking me where I'm going to work next. Because anyone who quits here will of course move on to a better job. I can't say that about myself, because I either don't have a job for the time being or I do something very simple that doesn't give me any anxiety. Even just the thought that my colleagues will get me a present as a good gesture drives me crazy, because nobody actually likes me and it will be just awkward. How could they like me when I never talk to them and everybody knows that. I will have a massive panic attack opening the present in front of them too. I just know that quitting will be a huge challenge for me and I'm not sure if I'm strong enough. But staying on the other side isn't working either for me. Can anyone relate to this or has been in a similar situation? Thankful for any advise 🙏"
"Hi all,
 

 I have been working with myself though therapy of different sorts since I was around 23 and I am now 28. 5 years. I mainly suffer from social Anxiety and performance anxiety (when I have to performe in front of others, examns, on stage, speaking etc.). 
 

 Nothing has really ever truly helped me unfortunalty. 
 

 Last winter I spoke to my doctor and we decided medicine could be something to try. I tried Venlafaxine which did work for my anxiety, but also gave me serious hair loss. So i stopped. Then I tried Setraline which gave me seriouse sexual side effects. So I stopped it recently. I was off it for 2 months and started to feel my anxiety come back. I just started Trintellix last week, but I am pretty certain I already feel the same sexual side effects as with Setraline. So I might have to stop it. 
 

 I am looking for any natural remedies that can just work at a fraction of the medicine. Did anyone tried cannabis oil/CBD/CBG oil ? Or microdosing or anything that might work ?? 
 

 I did try Kratom, saffron, st james wort etc. with very little effect. 
 

 Please let me know, as I am growing tired of my issues. I feel it is night and day when quitting the medicine. I fall back intro the same overly sensitive alert nervoussystem.
 

 Thank you for any reply"
"hello, was recently referred to a psychiatrist for anxiety &amp; depression. what can I expect upon my first visit?"
"As the title suggests, is anyone struggling to start medication? I’ve been trying everything I can to find something that makes a difference to me before I try medication, but I can’t seem to bring myself to take it.
 

 I’m terrified of the side effects, sorry potential side effects, with part of my anxiety being a phobia of vomiting. 
 

 I’ve had anxiety in differing intensities throughout my life from the age of 6 to now 26 and managed with CBT therapy, but the last 4 months have been hell for me - health anxiety, generalised anxiety, panic disorder and minor depression (likely due to being frustrated and feel like I’m never going to get better)."
"I'm scared it could make it worse, or that I could have an 8 hour long panic attack from the drugs. Or that it could make me a emotionless zombie and I will create soulless art and writing from then after.
 

 I'm on my second hours long anxiety episode today and its 3:40 in the morning unable to sleep. I really think I'm going to discus medication with my therapist tomorrow. But I read about the medication my doctor recommended (Wellbutrin) and heard it could make it worse. I've always had strong and strange reactions to medication, I got a panic attack from the adrenaline they use at the dentists to stop bleeding and I think weed gave me this anxiety disorder. I'm scared it could make things worse. And I'm also scared my art and writing will suffer and be influenced by the medication. I don't want my creativity going away."
"I'm 29 and had my first anxiety attack a couple of months ago. Since then I've only had one or two and they're not too serious.
 

  But I've always been a calm and collected person. My friends at university used to say I was like their therapist because I'd keep everyone calm coming up to big exams and stuff.
 

 But recently I've realised I've always been anxious and just was really good at keeping it down. I've always chewed my nails to stumps, could never sleep without background noise to distract me, click my teeth when I'm stressed and drink a lot just to help me sleep. I'm lucky to have a partner to talk with who doesn't judge.
 

 I was just hoping other people had the same experience. It feels like I've always been able to deal with stress and now I be can't. Like a big part of my identity is gone or I'm not as strong as I thought I was and that sucks."
"(26F) I've been going out alone a lot lately because i don't have a lot of friends i can hang out with, and i have some favorite coffee shops/pubs i go very often, but I'm starting to feel like people look at me like I'm some kind of a loser/weirdo for not having friends to go out and always being alone. At the same time I'm really comfortable with my own company like i can go out for a coffee or get drunk all by myself and not have a problem with it, I just can't seem to stop caring about what other people might think about me :////
 Also idk if this post is appropriate here but really wanted to hear other people's opinions on this."
"Warning for everyone who is triggered by discussions related to menstruation and abortion. 
 

 Hello! I’d like to talk today about anxiety that is brought on or worsened by hormones. I am a 25F who has had anxiety all of my life, but in the last two years has worsened to the point where I can barely function half the time. Where to start, where to start.
 

 2 years ago I fell pregnant. I was very happy but unfortunately due to medical issues with the fetus I had to have an abortion. This devastated me and caused me to be depressed and anxious. I couldn’t find my way out, and I had this nagging feeling that my trauma wasn’t the only thing causing my anxiety. I pushed that feeling down and went to therapy and psychiatrists. I got my thyroid checked. I changed my diet and started exercising more when I could get out of bed. My therapist said to write down my feelings and physical symptoms in a diary or an app. We started noticing that my anxiety was deeply connected to my menstrual cycle. Instead of feeling worse around my period, I felt better. More like my old self. Less anxious and by far, happier. I also had been dealing with loss of libido and dissatisfaction after orgasming. (I could get the big O, but it didn’t quite hit the spot). All of which could easily be attributed to my anxiety and depression, but something inside me tells me it is hormone related. I finally got my doctor to green light a hormone test but my insurance is fighting it, saying it’s not medically necessary. So I bought a cheap one off of Amazon and it’ll be here in a week or so, but I won’t get the results for 2 weeks-4 weeks after.
 

 I am impatient and having quite a rough time (I’m post-period with the worst anxiety I’ve had in a while) and I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience or knows someone who’s had a similar experience. Anyone in the medical field is also very welcome to put their two cents in. 
 

 Sorry to all of those this may offend, but if you have an opinion on my abortion, please keep it to yourself. If I could have my baby in my arms I would give anything in the world. That being said, I’m very much pro-choice and very aware some people might not agree with that."
"Had a bad night last night and was up until 5:30. I couldn't lay down or else I would get super dizzy and anxious again. Does anybody have know what could be going on, or have simpler experiences? I've definitely have had stuff like this happen before."
"I've had anxiety since I was bout 15 years old. It first started when I had my first panic attack after smoking some laced weed. Really fucked me up. After that attack I would wake up having panic attacks, went on meds for about 6 months, stopped taking them and felt like a young teenager again with mild occasional anxiety (the normal kind) and went about life loving the young carefree life.
 

 Fast forward to 23 years old and my anxiety came back but even harder. This time of my life I was very stressed due to poor relationship, new baby, school &amp; low income. It was a tough patch in my life. This time however my anxiety got so bad that I couldn't even leave my room. It was constant panic at every waking minute. I somehow managed to get thru it with no medication and overcame that obstacle. Things in my life changed and I was much happier.
 

 Now I am 27, single mother, still attending school, working, &amp; raising a child and my anxiety is crippling. I did go back to school in person now that covid is semi over and I kmow school has alot to do with my anxiety esp since I have to commute to school and home which is an hour away (2 hours of driving everyday) and barely have any time to study in between my work and being a mother. 
 

 The funny thing about this time around however is my anxiety is triggered but DRUGS! Yes drugs. And the funny thing is I haven't touched any sort of drug since I had that bad panic attack at 15 YEARS OLD. THAT WAS 12 YEARS AGO. 
 

 I'll start to panic once I feel anxiety coming I'll think ""omg did I eat something with weed in it? Did I touch something and now it's absorbing thru my skin and I'm getting high?"" I think the most irrational things and idk how to stop it. It's literally driving me insane. Anyone have advice on how to end this madness or is going thru the same thing?"
"I keep thinking things like ""This is technically illegal because it was uploaded to YouTube without the proper copyright"" and I will have to solve this whole problem about what I should do, even if I had this exact dilemma happen 15 min before. This can also happen with watching something maybe I shouldn't or that my anxiety will make me go crazy, ect. Even things like getting anxious over being on a giant spinning ball in space.
 

 How do I stop this? I wish I could stop thinking. I have been very religious for the past couple of years."

"I know that overthinking about what to say next is normal for us with social anxiety, but does anyone else have trouble expressing your thoughts into words and/or remembering what you were going to say mid sentence because you’re so in your head? Sometimes I have a hard time explaining myself and I’m constantly asked to repeat myself several times. 
 

 I’m 27F and work as a manager at a startup -I have severe social anxiety but put a brave face on at work. I’ve improved with initiating conversations and speaking up in meetings, but most times I stumble on my words and ramble on trying to make sense of what I’m saying. It comes out sounding like word vomit. I also forget simple words mid sentence. It makes me want to be quiet and not say anything at all.
 

 I know most of my problems would improve if I had more confidence, but confidence doesn’t appear overnight. I’ve gotten better overtime but does anyone else deal with this? And are there things that you do to help during interactions and the aftermath of rumination?"
"Hello friends! Back in summer I posted here about being super anxious about driving. I used to cry every day about it because I was so scared and honestly my driving instructor wasn't very supportive.
 

 But then they changed my instructor and she was so sweet and patient with me. If you feel like you don't click with your instructor, ask for a new one! You are the paying customer. It makes a huge difference.
 

 I had my exams today too. The cops were rather mean and tried to annoy us on purpose, but by the grace of God I passed all the required exams and tomorrow I'm getting my license.
 

 I'm still not super confident in driving yet, but remember, neither you and I will be unless we keep practicing. Don't give up. You can do it. Cry your eyes out if you feel like it. But don't let it hold you back. 
 

 A few months ago I didn't believe I'd be here writing this today, but I am. And you will too. Best of luck to everyone! :)"
"I've apparently been grown by a single mom with Borderline Personality Disorder. If I'm not avoidant when the slightest thing triggers me, then I'm fully anxious when I can't figure what people actually intend...
 

 I just feel like I'm in a complete meltdown right now because my girlfriend left me (M25) after a chain of events, while she (27 F) is dealing with her Narcissistic mother (NPD patient)
 

 We were so happy we found each other and there were times when the fact that time is passing meant that we won't be together enough - and then it all went sideways.
 

 I'm doing therapy for ~2 months now but this feels more and more and more brutal to me. I wake up fine most days, but on top of this there are days when I just don't want to exist or I have intrusive thoughts of how I would rather not be here to harm anyone.
 

 What is more, recently I adopted a rescue cat, believing I would feel better for taking care of it and ""it would make me more responsible"", however, this turned out to not be true, because I feel like I got the cat for the very wrong reason. I got scratched and I have to clean up and keep the room I'm allowing the cat to be in all the time and clean her and... I just can't."
"Hey all! I F27 am at a pretty low point right now with my depression, anxiety and PMDD. I’ve barely left my apartment in like 2.5 weeks and find myself stuck in bed most of the day. A fair amount of it is situational and will pass but I’m really trying to find different ways to help myself. I’ve recently started new meds as well and am waiting to see if they help. 
 

 I’m sure a lot of people can relate to having the TV on almost constantly when going through something like this and so I’m looking for show recs that might inspire me rather than just the same comfort shows I’ve been watching over and over. I realize it’s not enough to pull me out but it’s better than watching random trash or things I’ve seen a million times. TIA!"

It’s really hard to explain this but I feel like my senses are always in overdrive. Especially with vision. And temperatures. I notice every little thing with my body too. My anxiety has been a part of me for almost 20 years now and always remember being like this for the most part. Anyone else relate or am I crazy lol
"(Long read ahead. If you take the time to read and share your stories, I'll appreciate it)
 Drop here all your issues related to stomach/bowel/abdomen die to high stress or anxiety periods, and if you managed to get it under control. Also if you got checked out and what did the doctors say.
 I'm my case, the symptoms vary, come and go, and sort of move around, but it's been going on for about 4 months now:
 

 - Pressure upper mid abdomen
 - Bloated feeling, specially on the right side
 - Occasionally loose stool
 - Very frequent bowel movement
 - Constipation
 - Abdomen tightness
 - Rarely get stabbing pains, specially on right side
 - Sometimes pain/tightness goes to the back
 - Gurgling
 - Gas
 - Feeling weird after bowel movement, sort of like a nausea but not exactly that. Not sure how to explain that one
 

 For context: I have been under immense amounts of stress for almost two years now. Been having to move a lot, been unemployed, uninsured, and in countries where I cannot communicate easily. Currently I'm living in a horrible, dirty and noisy city, with the help of my parents, since I can't afford anything. I hate living off of them, knowing how expensive it is. The noise, the air quality, food and water quality is horrible. And of course, all the world events don't help at all. Yes, I have health anxiety so that adds up to the stress, when every little mark I see on my body, or every little feeling, pain, symptom, automatically means I'm dying.
 

 I have been to two gastroenterologists, and they told me I have possible GERD, reflux, and maybe even IBS. But could not afford to get tested for anything. They're not worried about cancer.. I am, though, of course.. I never vomited and never saw anything alarming in terms of color of stool, or obvious blood in stool, apart from what seemed to be a small rupture with bright red blood on the paper after wiping, which happened months ago and never again. I remember it hurt going n° 2 that time, so most likely I hurt myself and hence the blood.
 

 I was also dealing with severe fatigue for about a month or two, but that went away too, after fixing my sleeping schedule and moving a bit more. 
 

 Thanks for your time! Hope you're all doing well!!"

"Has anyone here had anxiety and stress that made you think you have heart problems? M27 with a history of mild anxiety, and some massive life changes happening right now. 
 My heart will race, palpitations, tightness, I’ll feel like I can’t catch my breath, and when those happen, it’s almost like I talk my self into thinking I have horrible heart problems. It’s been like this for almost two weeks. I even bought a pulse oximeter to monitor, and now I see my oxygen levels dip below %95 and that almost sends me into another spiral."

"I (m25) have been with an on and off relationship with my girlfriend (f25) because of my RA. We’ve been together 5 years if we’re not going to count the breaks, I just found out about RA just about a month ago thru instagram via RA coaches, and it really placed a perspective in how I handle this.
 

 For context, we did not start out very “right,” with our relationship, I feel like I kept on through this relationship because I have to. And I’m trying to prove something? Getting into the matter I felt most affected by the fact that I feel like God is against me. Or is not approved of my decisions in staying in this relationship. 
 

 And that sucked because my partner doesn’t deserve that. Like she deserves someone who would be sure of her and doesn’t justify sh*t like this with her. At the same time, I wanted to learn to love her and to explore my anxiety, and sure enough some of it started showing like, intergalactic expectations on my partner and on love. Comparisons on other relationships, advices from friends and family, etc. 
 

 Right now, I could say that I have progressed at least a bit (5% ish?), but I feel like some of the core issues are still there left unresolved? And going back to my “faith” issues. And I keep circling back on wanting to break up with my partner just to ease the anxiety and to appease my “God.”
 

 Do you have any recommendations? Or did anyone has experienced this? Any book recommendations, coaches, etc? Much appreciated!"
"Every now and then I get like an intense flushed feeling almost like I'm on the verge of passing out but I never actually pass out. Like a sick feeling as well. 
 

 Does anyone else get this? Just makes me really worried something's wrong with my heart sometimes. 
 

 Sure it's fine as had heart checks before but yeh just sends me into a dive when it happens."
Hey everyone I don’t have insurance and really haven’t been to a doctor in years . At 27 and after trying a new after being at my current job for 5 years I realized my anxiety is way out of control and I probably need medication. I’ve tried better help before with not much luck and wanted to know if anyone has any other options.
"A little backstory here: 
 

 I (25M) had undiagnosed anxiety for almost my whole life but it was manageable and somewhat mild, but got extremely bad 6 months ago, with multiple panic attacks per day, constant DPDR, and couldn’t leave my room.
 

 Long story short I implemented a strict routine that includes a lot of exercise and managed to reduce my anxiety to manageable levels, but for the past week maybe, my anxiety was nonexistent, I was in a better mood than I ever remember being! Which should be a W but I started getting anxious because I’m not anxious anymore? Is this normal? Did my exercise routine pay off? Is that really it? 
 These are the thoughts I’ve been struggling with and has somewhat made me a bit anxious.
 

 I was wondering if anyone has been through something similar? Is this normal? Is getting rid of anxiety that sudden?"
"So background info I had convinced myself that I had brain c* and finally got an MRI which came back completely normal. I was elated for a few days, then I started obsessing over my heart. Now I have heart palpitations and am always checking my HR and O2 levels. I had an EKG done two days ago which was fine and my O2 leelse at the Dr were 100. A month ago My dr tried to get me a heart monitor but my insurance denied it (he thinks it’s just my anxiety but wanted to ease my nerves) this morning my heart rate was 59 which really freaked me out that it was possibly too slow. I’ve checked it multiple times today and it is more normal 65-75 but now I can’t stop thinking I have a heart problem since I never got to wear the heart monitor 😭"
"I've been emotionally abused during my childhood and much of that was also met by actual resources scarcity. I remember my mom couldn't manage healthy food for the two of us and always minding me how much I eat and how hard it's for her because of me.
 

 For this reason I'm now 25, I'm well off, self made, still putting the time and effort in, but with all this I have scarcity mentality which triggers my anxiety every day.
 

 Can anyone recommend a book on this? This mentality extends to everything and everyone: food, money, love. 
 

 I'm blessed to be able to see a therapist already, but I would stll like to read something on this."
"I’m at the age where a lot of people are getting married and they all have a wedding party (groomsman, bridesmaids, maid of honor, best man), and I always wonder “how do people have all these close friends?!” I don’t have any friends at all, so I guess I’m jealous and bitter - It makes me feel more isolated than I already am. I am always worried for when I get married and have no one to stand with me… even though I don’t have a partner rn/don’t meet people because of my social anxiety lol so idk why I worry so much about it. I guess it’s just a reminder of how lonely I am. 
 

 Does anyone else ever think of this?"
"Does anyone's anxiety get really bad when people use words that are associated with time, such as months or when they speak of things scheduled in the future? I get an intense feeling of panic when I hear things like that  
 

 

 I had a really strong rush of anxiety when a friend asked if I could hang out this weekend, and it was hard to type a response even if I wanted to... because my mind and body started to clench up, I guess? 
 

 

 My therapist thinks it could be because of my mind feels there's an inability to be able to count on things. 
 

 

 It feels like I'm in a state of panic a lot of times, particularly when I'm not home... I feel comfortable home, and I don't have such intense feelings of impending doom like when I have to leave home. I start to get anxious because of the possibilities of something horrible happening.... 
 

 

 How do I cope with this? I'm 25 and I feel bad because it's hard to make plans to hang out with people or schedule other things because of this...idk, inability to count on those scheduled things?"
I know I posted countless times about it.. I just can't do this anymore. I'm scared. I'm crying all day
"So this is the deal... People always ask me why don't I have children, a wife or a GF, I am 30years old man.
 The thing is I never did have a close relationships of any kind because I have trouble connecting with people and especially meeting someone new and my connection with very few old friends and family is very much on the surface level.
 Usually the new people I meet are my new colleagues, they only talk to me as long as they see me or as long as I am of benefit, but for example if I quit job(which I do often), I rarely ever encounter them....
 Recently this guy a former colleague who I helped out quite a bit before our last conversation asked me an usual why am I single question just before ending our meeting and I just told him the truth, I do not know why- I have never done that before because I always thought that this is the weirdest answer anyone could give, I think it makes me look mentally ill which may not be very far from truth because I generally do not feel OK with opening up to people and socializing, I think people stigmatize such people like me...
 

 This state of mine really looks like a dead end to me, when you are young and start socializing you can build skill and gradually people will be OK at engaging with you, but I never had that and I think the lack of social intelect radiates some kind of repulsive aura hence mature people see me as unworthy to engage with...
 

 

 Do you have any insight about what is it about me?
 I have a few times been told by some people that I sesm to be OK and it really upsets me that people think beautiful lie will do good, from my observation I am far cry from how other people interact.
 Please don't say everything seems to be OK, that is the most hatmful thing to do, it'd imply I cannot change anything, which I do not believe, I just need to see what needs to be fixed, what makes me so unpleasant to be around?"
"I've had a really bad week in terms of anxiety, but after the first day or so, I found something out. There seems to be a difference between the actual anxiety and the panic it causes. I'm sometimes unable to stop the anxiety right away, but if I almost challenge it or whatever I'm doing, it doesn't become fear and remains a strong bodily sensation.
 

 Still exhausting though, and I need mental focus for this to work. If I forget I can do this, the fear would probably come back. Also, I have to constantly remember that it will always make me feel like the end of the world, almost think its making me stronger as a person, like if I can handle my own body's ultimate threat response, then I can handle anything.
 

 Still exhausting though, and been getting body pains from I'm assuming from tensing mussels all the time."
"26M had anxious phases throughout my life in differing intensities, OCD, Panic Disorder, Emetophobia, GAD, Health Anxiety. The last 10 years of my life I had been great, I definitely had anxious tendencies but I was able to manage day to day without any need for treatment or excessive mindfulness.
 

 3 months ago out of the blue I had an extremely stressful few weeks that brought me back to the overthinking, stressful, worrying state that I worked so hard to beat in my last episode when I was 16/17. I had a panic attack, which at the time felt like I was having a heart attack or lung failure. Recognised it and moved on, still a bit concerned. 2 days later at work I noticed my heart beating a bit harder than normal. The dizziness, sweating, weak feeling came over me and ever since then the dizziness has been there without fail non stop for 3 months.
 

 I wasn’t particularly anxious at this stage, but was concerned about it. No GP or medical professional has found any issue with me from bloods, ECG, chest X-rays. They diagnosed me with mixed GAD and depressive disorder.
 

 I started googling everything, trying to figure out why a doctor couldn’t diagnose me and took it on myself. Big mistake. I developed health anxiety. I ended up in hospital thinking I was having a heart attack. I tried everything I could to find what was causing the dizziness, I went to the dentist as I was having a bit of tooth pain and was told my wisdom tooth had erupted and was infected, that could be causing my dizziness. I was put on antibiotics and I had relief knowing there was a cause.
 

 A week later I visited my doctor as understandably, even with diagnosis, I was still now an anxious wreck most of the time. My GP ordered a stool sample and a full blood test for deficiencies. Turns out, I had a C. Diff infection - for those that don’t know a nasty infection of the gut. I was asymptomatic and the doctor still treated it and now, I know with an ineffective antibiotic that causes lots of systemic problems. The antibiotics caused me to have a depressive and suicidal breakdown so I was stopped.
 

 4 weeks later, I’m now having what I think is a reoccurrence of the infection and I need to be tested. I’m terrified of what that can mean and what more antibiotics will do to my gut flora and the gut-brain axis. 
 

 I can’t feel like this anymore. I want this to all end. I can’t fight an infection, anxiety, depression and I have a massive fear of taking my prescribed Sertraline due to potential side effects mostly nausea and vomiting. I’m trying therapy, hypnotherapy, massages, herbal supplements.
 

 Is there anyone out there I can chat to? I’m feeling hopeless and irritable."
"Okay so anxiety lately is bad. I am a loaner always have been. Lately what's been playing on my mind is I literally have no friends, no one. So here I am... looking for people to talk to about anything you want. I find it difficult to find friends so I thought I'd give this a shot. I'm 27, have a daughter and 2 dogs. My snapchat is mozza0429. Feel free to start a conversation"
"Right now I'm 25 years old and have felt like a loser my whole life, basically. Throughout my middle and high school years I had no friends, was alone all the time and to this day it just bothers me. I could never hold down a job either and at the moment I'm on disability as my doctors diagnosed me with OCD and Asperger's. It seems no matter what I try, I can't seem to fit in anywhere even on the online settings. I typically try to join smaller game communities and forums and even then I feel like I'm being ignored after a while. Has anyone else ever suffered with this? What type of advice would you give to people with this problem?"
"Has anyone had this from anxiety? I’m anxious that it’s an infection I had recently (that can come back). Doesn’t matter how much I eat, the hunger “pain” comes back very quickly and sometimes doesn’t go even when eating. I often end up with a lot of gas and trapped wind cramps as well.
 

 I had lost 25lb in 3 months, whether that was from anxiety/stress or the infection I don’t know."
"So I’ve been working as a medical receptionist at a GP practice for 7 months now, but I’m getting bored of it now and I’ve also been feeling depressed recently because of my job. It’s the same cycle and it’s getting to me. Dealing with rude patients and trying to stay calm at the same time is too much for me sometimes. And we’re having to do some courses that I couldn’t care less about. According to my colleagues who have been working there for years, these courses are a waste of time as they don’t really make a difference within the practice.
 

 I want to leave but I really need the money. I don’t know what to do. I feel like my depression is getting worse and I can’t even leave the job. I feel like I am stuck here"

"Hey guys, I am 25M currently studying in one of the top schools in the US and I have been blessed with a great and comfortable life till now. I was diagonized with GAD about three months ago and I have been employing following strategies to calm myself down.
 

 **Gym and Meditation:** I am making sure that I do these two things everyday that help me get through most of the day comfortably.
 

 **Therapy and practicing Gratefulness:** These are helping me identify thought patterns that are negative and practicing gratefulness improves my mood momentarily.
 

 I am now at a stage where I am identifying negative and destructive thoughts that are impractical as hell but I am not able to stop them or dipute them effectively using the ABC techniques. I believe the solution to my anxiety lies in making my thoughts more positive in the first cognition of an event itself. I know it will take time to do this but I believe I should start the process. I will bring this up to my therapist this week but also I wanted your thoughts on the same. Can anybody suggest some books or videos that educate about changing the thought patterns?

Has anyone else had both their hands and both feet go numb off and on. First day this has happened. I have a CT scan next monday to rule out things for a migraine diagnosis so I am super anxious all the time but not shakey. Any reassurance is appreciated
"(29M) over the course of the last few months I have developed a horrible case of insomnia that causes me not to sleep for days at a time, even with a prescription for zolpidem. Alongside this I have started to develop deeper anxiety &amp; greater feelings of anger &amp; irritation. These last few months have been a rough time im currently waiting for an appointment at a behavioral health center. I have a girlfriend who loves me &amp; is so supportive in every way yet I still feel this way. I was just wondering if there was anyone who can relate and offer any advice"
"I’m (F25) dating my bf (M25) for 8 months. Both of us struggle with anxieties plus I have some other health issues. We both help, take care of and support each other, even tho we had quite a few problems (that mostly were based on my poor mental condition in that time), we never fought, always figured it out together and moved on. I truly love my bf and would do anything for him. But he claims he doesn’t love me. Or he doesn’t fully. Generally I feel being loved, all my needs are met and we spent a lot of time together. Even on physical side is everything alright so I don’t know what to think, what to do. I know he has trust issues and in his previous relationship he realized he loved her after they already broke up.
 Last time we talked about it he had a meltdown and he was truly devastated by the fact he still didn’t fall in love. Part of me thinks it’s all caused by anxieties or that he simply doesn’t know his definition of what love is therefore he can’t realize it. But I’m truly scared. I don’t want to lose him but also don’t want to spend my life in loveless relationship."
"I've had a bad anxiety episode I'm trying to recover from maybe six days ago. Right now I feel super out of it, like I'm not really doing what I'm doing. Can anybody tell what's going on?
 

 Written maybe a min and a half later: I'm feeling a lil better now, but its just a miserable sickening feeling, like I'm in some kind of dream about to wake up dehydrated or something."
"I didn't have bad anxiety when I had people to hang out with. I never had a girlfriend or anything, but I at least had 2 friends who would hang out. Its been a few years back at my parents now and IDK what to do. I have no idea how to make new friends, and I live in a rural island in the middle of the pacific ocean. I had a panic attack a few months ago just going into town.
 

 So to deal with being constantly alone for two years, I'm going to try medication so I'm not anxious everyday. I feel like this could be solved with human interaction, but I only know how to get medication. And IDK if I can even go outside to meet new friends because I could get a panic attack. It makes me feel like I'm gonna go insane sometimes. I'm sometimes scared that I'm to far gone"
"Does anyone want to chat, struggling myself right now with panic. Send me a message"
"Guys I just want to see if any of you feel like this or if you think its more… 
 

 After a health scare that turned out to be nothing 7 years ago, that I stressed over for a couple weeks, not sleeping etc, I began to get headaches/fatigue/panic and never recovered. Every single day my head doesn’t feel right but I persist on.
 

 Anyone else feel like this, even when not anxious? 
 

 Had lots of blood work, MRI and ECG in the past, multiple antidepressants.. Starting to worry its CFS although I see they can get bed bound and I am never."
So I had my standard lab work done and normal bilirubin is .3-1.2 and mine was 1.5 :( my dr told me to just monitor in a couple months but I can’t help but to not be freaking out that my liver is not healthy or something 😭
"I’m a woman in my late 20s and I deactivated my Instagram about a year ago. At first it was because my social anxiety was so bad, but after a while I liked not having it anymore because there was no longer any unneeded pressure for posting my life, so I’ve never reactivated it. Social media just seems so toxic and fake to me, and I was using it to paint my life to be so much better than it actually was.
 

 Ive always thought about this but today I mentioned it to my psychologist for the first time and she wrote it down as if it was important information, and it got me thinking “is it concerning to not have it?” I might be overthinking it, but wanted to get other peoples opinions on this. And will this effect my dating life? Because my social anxiety is already hindering that lol"
So i have alot of tension in general. HOWEVER. Recently this symptom popped up that is only on one side and its like from the bottom of my jaw to my collar bone on only one side that is so tight my head is almost pulled to that side and when i try to swallow i get a tugging sometimes. I try to stretch it out and nothing helps. Im hoping its one of those weird anxiety symptoms that comes for a few weeks and then one day disappears and i never see it again. But i dont have trouble swallowing. It just feels extremely tight and i have no idea if its normal. Has anyone else experienced this?
"So I (29M) started dating this girl (27M). I matched with her on the apps February ‘22 but she lives in NY and I live in LA. At the time I was out in NY visiting and we matched on the app, hit it off on convo and made plans to hang out. Unfortunately god had other plans and she ended up canceling two days before as her mom went to the hospital and later in March her mom passed away. Flash forward to April she reaches out to me (I’m assuming after her grieving cycle) and we continue texting daily until we do 2 virtual FT dates and then we finally meet in person in NY early August. It was an amazing first date but we didn’t kiss at the end of it. She reaches back out and we spend the next few days together hanging out a lot (I spent the week at her place) until she starts asking me to be exclusive with her. She brought it up several times and before I left in the middle of August we begin officially dating exclusively. Now it’s been two weeks but she’s already had a couple of anxiety attacks in terms of if “I’m the one” and if “she’ll ever fall in love with me, are we just meant to be friends”. She also just mentioned she gets a lot of anxiety whenever she thinks of us and our future together long term. She mentioned she’s been dealing with anxiety since she was 16 and regularly has these episodes but she is actively trying to work on it. As in she’s had these anxiety situations in previous relationships and that’s what caused them to not work out. This girl is really cute and in person we get along insanely well, we can talk about anything, have good family values etc. But her anxiety has been really tough to deal with especially since we are doing long distance (we plan to see each other for a week every month). She’s constantly questioning us together &amp; our future and then she questions whether she can fall in love with me or am I just a really good friend which makes me consider if we should even be dating exclusively. Whenever I bring up the convo she says she always self sabotages and we owe it to ourselves to continue trying. Should I continue giving this a shot? My past relationships have left me a bit scarred in terms of pouring my all into a relationship and I just want to make sure I don’t end up getting hurt on the other side of this. 
 

 

 TLDR: Girl I’m dating now for two weeks was super into becoming exclusive before but after getting into a long distance relationship with me now has a lot of anxiety about us together and questions if we are more than friends or not. She wants to continue to “try” dating but I’m afraid of getting hurt at the end of this."
"I'm in my mid 20s and still live with my family. Never had a gf, don't talking with people outside my family, and spend most my time gaming, drawing, writing, and pacing in my room. I also don't eat very well. In a general (since everybody's different) how much better would my anxiety and panic attacks be if I lived a normal life?"
"My girlfriend wants my feelings for her to have a limit. I thinks that's the right way. I suddenly got hurt and angry a bit. Thoughts came to my mind like ""She doesn't love me that much; She expects our relationship will end sooner or later..."" Which she has a point. But is it right to be asked by your partner to not express your love for them? I am 25 years old and male.. Fuck. This is getting me carried away.. Anyone think of this? Thank you..."

 So yeh if you've made it this far thanks for reading. I'm not sure what to do now. I feel like I'm wasting my GPs time when I keep going to them but I want answers. Me and my partner are thinking of having a little one next year and on my bad days I get worried that whatever this is is going to kill me. 
 

 Part of me accepts that it may be anxiety disorder and the medication and therapy has helped a lot. But still all these physical sensations remain a year later and they scare the crap out of me. 
 

 Any advice on what to do going forward? As at a bit of a loss. Some days I feel great, then others feel like a joke! 
 

 I look back on how I was before all this started and it seems like a dream sometimes how I was before."
"i'm sure this is probably just my anxiety, but i needed to know if anyone else has felt like this recently. i feel like i'm failing as an adult. a little background, i (26f) moved out of my parents house with my brother (24m). we moved about 20 min away to a two bedroom apartment. we got a cat, we pay rent and we have food on the table. but recently all i can think about is how much debt i have. this move really set my plans back (as most moves do) but i'm worried im going to fail. i already lost my car insurance because i couldn't afford it, im just afraid im going to get evicted. i have suffered from anxiety and depression for years and now that i've finally gotten free of my old environment, im afraid im going to end up back there. is this normal?"
What are some things you do to meet friends? So I(25m) live in South Dakota and there's not much to do but I want to go out and meet people. I'm sick of being on the internet or playing games by myself. The problem is there are no clubs or events around that would interest me (I just find cooking classes and women's self-help classes). So I'm curious about what you guys do.
"I'll try and keep it short but I have been struggling with SA for as long as I can remember. Anytime we went anywhere when I was younger my mom would always announce to everyone that I was just super shy but I never really got comfortable around anyone, not even her. I have been struggling in every way possible trying to take care of myself but I genuinely feel like there is nothing I can do to make ends meet regarding a solid living situation. Freshman year of HS I moved into a friends house because I couldn't take the at home arguments anymore.. It was an every day thing due to my moms alcoholism. I house hopped all throughout HS and wanted to go to college but the thought of having to do any sort of presentation kept me away. Now I am 25 with no college education and the only jobs I have had were relatively tame but never permanent. The best one I had was working with a health care department but that was only a few months out of the year. I continued to work there whenever I could but we ended up having to make outbound calls which absolutely ruined me. I don't understand why it is so hard to just read a script and write down some answers but I would ALWAYS butcher it. I would start off with the script but as soon as I heard an answer from the other line I would get really nervous and sweaty thinking I was going to upset or have them hang up. I haven't done it since... I am getting extremely close to needing to move but I have no income at the moment and in a few weeks I'll be stuck with no place. My drive has been absolutely ruined and anytime I think about it, being homeless really doesn't sound that bad. I get to be alone for the most part and out of the way of others. The cheapest rent around me is roughly $1000-$1500 for a place that isn't shared and I don't think I will be able to do it. I don't think I have enough experience to acquire any decent remote job and I can't see myself getting any better to work out of home. I tried with some simple courier jobs but I just can't freaking do it and it makes me feel like shit every single day I try. I see friends flourish with all these opportunities because communication is no issue for them. Why tf am I such a loser and why can't I just get over this fear of social situations. My drinking has gotten pretty bad but I have slowed down a lot due to the expenses needed for it. I know this ended up being way too long but I just don't really know what to do anymore so this was my last resort to trying to find help. I don't have healthcare and I can't afford a therapist out of pocket so talking to anyone is pretty much out of the question. I was on SSRI's for my depression a little over a year ago but abruptly dropped it due to panic attacks and other issues regarding refills at the time. (healthcare dropped me and I couldn't pay the expenses.) I am just in a hole and don't really see myself getting out of it. What do you do when ""just go out and get experience"" doesn't work? All I hear is ""it gets easier if you put yourself out there"" but it has done nothing but make my self confidence absolutely plummet. I can't even talk to friends anymore without feeling like an idiot... 
 

 

 TL;DR: Have a few weeks left where I am at then probably gonna be homeless for a bit. Social anxiety is so bad that I can't keep a job nor can I even apply to one with fear of the interview or phone call. No insurance or enough funds to pay for a therapist. Pretty much bottom of the barrel loser."
i'm 25 and i feel like my social anxiety has just gotten worse. since my boyfriend and i broke up i isolated myself a lot more and i feel like i almost don't know how to talk to people at all anymore. i started a new job and just started school again and i feel so anxious every single day. i literally have one friend i don't know how to make friends and i'm tired of being like this. i do feel like there is a big chance i will just end up being alone and not be able to find anyone else either. at work and school i'm almost like a mute. i can't keep living like this. i see people at school hanging out and talking in the hallways and i want that. why is it so hard for me? i can't live like this forever i seriously think that if nothing changes soon that this could bring me to suicide
I’ve been handling my anxiety and panic attacks a little better lately but I have an MRI with contrast next week and I’m super nervous. I’ve read it can make you dizzy which is one of my panic attack triggers :( luckily I was able to find an open MRI machine to go to!

I (25F) constantly have irrational thoughts that my partner or other people that are in my life like co workers are out to get me. I constantly feel overwhelmed because my mind not only thinks irrationally but most of my thiughts are very conflicted. Theres times i have deluaional thoughts of my bf being supportive then unsupportive at the same time or feelings that people in my life are trying to hold me back because they feel like im not capable but at the same time want to put pressure on me to deal with their issues for their convenience. How do i go about changing my mindset? How can i become less anxious over irrational thoughts that arent my reality?
"I come from a really manipulative and dysfunctional family. From growing up till now, I experienced physical, mental, and relational abuse. My father committed suicide, my mom is narcissistic and making me the black sheep of the family. My brother is the golden child and my mom loves him cuz he takes care of the family. I do not want to be involved in the family things because my mom has numerous debts and she always scams people money and don't have a real job. I tried to get away from this family but I am too broken myself to be functional. I have serious anxiety, depression, OCD and I am always staying home and isolated. I do not have family support already, but they even go further to hate me and badmouth me as the ""ungrateful daughter and irresponsible sister"". I do not have friends either cuz they judge me for being negative and they want to stay away from me for being negative. How can I be happy when I have all these unresolved and continuous traumas? My mom even said she is the victim of my anger and anorexia problems. And she uses ""happy family photos"" in her social media to promote her false good mom image (she forces me to smile in those photos). Numerous lies, manipulation and gaslighting have been going on, I know that and she keeps destroying me with these. I am in constant agony and pain, I do not want to continue to live, but I do not want to die because of my mom. I do not deserve death and suicide like my father, when the true perpetrator is still doing these horrible deeds every single day. But I don't know how to carry on already. I am so broken, tired and helpless."
I got my license about like 4 months and I have been using my bf car &amp; yesterday I finally bought my own car !!
"I would really like to start exercising at gym but I have this anxiety about going there and exercising while others are watching. I’m afraid my worst fear will come to life. 
  
 I also get anxiety about buying a gym membership because it makes me feel like I HAVE to go to gym often and even when I don’t want to go because I paid for it and I don’t want to waste money. 
  
 Have you been able to overcome a fear of going to gym? If so, how did you do it?"

"All I(f25)wanna do is cry right now. I have a job that could be so great. It's an admin job but it's work from home and the tasks are fairly simple and the money is good. 
 

 Except my anxiety is determined to screw it up.
 

 I get so anxious about the simplest tasks that I get executive dysfunction and end up not doing it until I'm reprimanded or panicking and attempting to do it before I'm reprimanded.
 

 Right now I'm avoiding calls from my boss because I had something due a few days ago that I wasn't able to give in.
 

 I spoke to her about my anxiety before when it got really bad and promised to do better but that was a little over a month ago and it's bad again. I can't go to her with another sob story this soon. What do i do? What do you guys do??
 

 I'm on new meds right now and it'll take around 6 weeks to kick in and right now it genuinely feels like I'm getting worse. How do you guys do This? I need the money but I keep messing up."
"I felt like I an anxiety attack was just creeping up before I tried yelling with the punches I threw shadow boxing. I felt as though the anxiety was leaving my mouth as I softly yelled with every strike. Does anybody know what that's all about? My guess is that I ""spent"" the fear into something instead of just holding it in."
"TW for emetophobia. 
 

 

 Lately, nearly every time I get anxious I gag, dry heave, and sometimes even throw up. I’ve been dealing with anxiety since highschool (I’m 26F now), and this has never been a symptom. Does anyone else experience this? What should I do?"
"Hello everyone! 😊
 

 I am currently seeing someone, it’s been a month. At first i felt that click and interest but I feel as if as I am getting to know him there might be a possibility of me being losing interest. Before this guy i was in a relationship that lasted 2 years and i was completely in love with this guy, dare i say i was in cloud 9 since the day I met him. And i know guys are different and so are experiences, but somehow with this guy i felt the initial butterflies for the first 4 dates and now it’s just gone? I do care for him a lot but we have gotten into more fights recently (which I assume it’s normal since we are learning how to handle each other’s triggers) but part of me wonders… should it be this hard in the beginning? 
 

 Then again i suffered a lot in my last relationship, I was criticised a lot and had many panic attacks. I took time to heal from the break up but I think my walls are extremely up. So i think it could be that too… 
 

 Have you been through this? What if i’m incapable of feeling something so intense as i did once?"
[removed]
"I'm not sure if this is a symptom of social anxiety, but I thought I'd throw it out there. I meet someone new, latch onto them, and believe we're better friends than we are. Typically, because they're my only friend at the time. Or someone will compliment me and I'll start to believe that I'm more special to them than I am. I dig myself into a hole because I can't just let relationships form naturally. In the past, I've asked people a bunch of times if they still like me or want to be my friend. I have horrible abandonment issues. Looks like I need to go back into therapy...

 Hey!! Working on responding to everyone. Thanks for your kind words, y'all."
"So I've always been struggling with anxiety and depression but it spiked (and haven't really recovered to a more manageable state after 1yr break from uni) during my bachelor degree which I finished 1yr ago. I now got accepted into a master program which I applied for without thinking I would actually get in, but I did and I accepted the offer as it isn't given that I would get accepted at a later point (competitive course). I did however not feel mentally ready to study (but who knows how long it may take me to feel well enough) anyway. I am drained more than half the days and struggle to get stuff done, also have alot of anxiety because I think the course might be a bit to technical. It is still a highly intensive course (architecture) and idk. I need some advice on how to get something done on the worst days of anxiety and depression. Or not feel guilty for days I don't get things done. Idk. 
 

 Sorry if this is a mess and I'm not even sure what I'm asking, just feeling hopeless/helpless and need some support. I enjoy the course I just hate that I struggle to focus ans that I don't manage to get things done when I actually really want to (because I feel drained and stupid)"
"Ok listen, I haven’t properly socialized with anyone but my boyfriend and one friend via zoom for a year so now that I want to go out more and meet people and I realized I’m overly analyzing my interactions all the time and it’s exhausting! I don’t know what to say EVER because I fear saying the wrong thing and I just don’t want to be like this anymore :( I used to have fun with others and now it drains me, maybe there’s a lot to unpack here, but I feel so alone, anyone feels me? Xx"
"Hey all.
 

 28M here. I'm feeling lost and anxious about something. Tomorrow I start classes for my second year of university. Normally I'd be happy to go, but I'm currently working a night shift beforehand and then I have class all morning/into mid afternoon. I'm going to be absolutely exhausted, and I'm debating not going, but my friends keep saying I should. It's driving me insane wondering what I should do because I know I'm going to be too tired and probably won't absorb anything, but it's also the first day of classes.
 

 I honestly have no idea what to so."
"This is probably going to be a long text so bear with me please! 
 

 So I am 26M, I have been working in the same job for 9 years now and my anxiety seems to get worse every year. I work in a college, I don’t want to say what I do incase someone recognises me. let’s just say I am a helper. So I have been in the college for 9 years now. During the first year, I’d get a horrible feeling in my stomach whenever around a class of students, I’d get so nervous, I’d get dizzy and feel like I could pass out. I always thought it would be something I’d get used to, but I never did as 9 years later and It still feels like my first day. 
 I think I may be on the spectrum as I am very socially awkward, find it difficult to communicate and end up mumbling or jumbling up all my sentences. Possibly having autism probably plays a massive part but there are other factors too. 
 This is where our similarities probably end…
 

 What has made things worse for me is the fact that students complain about bad smells most of the time I am around them. Originally I assumed it was other students farting and I wasn’t close enough to smell it as I could never smell anything, but it got to a point where even my colleagues would point out a bad smell and ask if I farted. I never understood so I’d just laugh it off and agree with it. This went on for about 3 years. It got to a point where I started losing motivation in work, tried avoiding people at all times but due to my role, I had to constantly be around people. I got a job part time on weekends in greggs and noticed everyone I was near would make weird noises and take the pi55 out of me behind my back. Sometimes they would even make jokes infront of large groups of people who would all laugh at me. I lost all confidence and quit my part time job as I couldn’t handle it anymore. 
 Covid hit right after so I didn’t socialise properly for around 2 years which made me lose even more confidence. I broke my leg back in December and had 7 months off work. I’ve only just come back and I’ve hit a new low in confidence. Had to do some printing today and a bunch of staff members were outside the room, as I walked back out, one of the women said it stank in the area and they all walked off. 
 

 I am a very clean person, shower just before I go to work and when I get home, brush my teeth regularly and use deodorant a lot.
 I found a page about something called “TMAU” which is what I believe I have. I am unable to smell myself so I don’t know if it’s constant or every now and then.
 

 Has anyone here dealt with a similar situation?"
"I (F27) have a partner (M28) I’ve dated for years. He is close to his cousins as they are a little older than him but hang out a bit. His cousins all have wives and at least 2 or more kids. 
 

 At the start of our relationship I was very young and excited to get “in” with the family, attending all events, birthdays, baptisms, engagements, weddings, christmases and random dinners. 
 

 As I’ve gotten older I still have this social anxiety but I’m in a place where I’m trying to figure out who I “am” and no longer feel the need to want to “fit in” with them. 
 

 They are a very traditional type family/extended family where women are always inside at events with the kids and men are outside drinking/cooking meat. I find the women (nothing against them, just my observation as I’ve gotten older) to be very hard to relate to as every conversation is very surface level and/or about their kids/work/family life. 
 

 I now dread going to these events because it takes up so much of my energy to try and look happy when really I am struggling to hold a conversation and just want to go home.
 

 I thought to myself, if I was single I wouldn’t have to deal with any of this. I wouldn’t have to be dragged to these events and forced to hang out with them for the rest of my life. Forced to have conversations and look “alive”
 

 Does anyone else feel this way? Sorry, I know I sound like a Debbie downer but I seriously do not like going to these events anymore as I no longer have anything to prove."
"Hello, I am 28 y/o female. I have been experiencing headaches, dizziness etc. i have seen a neurologist to rule out a tumor, I have seen my eye doctor and got my prescription for glasses and contacts changed thinking maybe that was the trigger. 
 

 I have a loooot of stress. My husband and I make good money but I am a travel healthcare worker. My contract ends the end of September and I have been anxious and nervous ever since. How will I provide for my family? I don't want to drain my savings. I feel like a failure but this is normal for a contract worker to have a contract end and I knew this going in. I think its just the realization that after September 24 I will be unemployed. 
 

 Has anyone experienced symptoms from stress and anxiety like mine?"
"Any body else ever get random chest pains then automatically turns into anxiety 
 Or starts to get an anxiety attack then gets chest pains? 
 It definitely suuucks. 
 Then you'll overthink it more then ever 🥺😔"
"Guys I'm not trying to make any excuses with school, I'm generally a hard worker when it comes to courses I find interesting yet, if I were doing a problem I understood at home (no matter how hard) I would choke it up during the exam. There are times I feel like I would have to remember some things from scratch during the exam itself. How do I get over this?"
"I have been taking buspar 10mg twice a day (7am and 6pm) for anxiety and OCD and have been avoiding alcohol since I started about a month ago.
 

 Honestly I really miss drinking with friends and have been wondering if there is a way that I can still drink on at least Saturdays.
 

 I’ve been debating trying to maybe take my Friday dose, the. Skip Friday night through Saturday and start taking it again on Sunday so that I can drink on Saturday.
 

 Does anyone have experience with doing something along these lines or have any tips or warnings?"
"I just feel kind of hopeless. On top of the fact that I gave it my all and it still wasn’t successful, every sign points that it will just be even harder to make friends now that I’m graduated. I no longer have any easy ways to see people outside of my work, and people will be increasingly busy with their own lives. I feel like I missed my chance, which is extra depressing since I tried my hardest too."
"So i took a nap, and woke up to what felt like baby kicks under my rib cage. Like strong spasms. It didnt hurt. But it started this insane twitching that wont go away now. I really havent eaten much or drank much water today… so im running kinda on E. But its freaking me out and its like pulsing now. But of course im having anxiety along with it that its my heart or an aortic dissection or something stupid. I dont know if i should be scared or not its so unnerving and i hate it i dont know what to do."

"Having a brain tumor is something I’ve been so scared of since age like 12/13 (28 now) I finally begged my ENT to write a referral for a brain MRI. He is confident it will come back clean and I hope he’s right. I’ve worked myself up so much the days leading up to getting the MRI that I gave myself a migraine. Now I have a nasty cold that isn’t helping things. I should get my results tomorrow but idk how to make it too then. It’s all I can think about. I’ve had sinus headaches and ear fullness and sometimes dizziness for so long now I just want answers, but what if it’s not the answer I’m praying for 😭😭😭 my neck and back muscles are SO tense and I just feel drained by all this 😞 also- I am finally seeing a therapist so hopefully it’ll help one day .."
"I’m a very paranoid person. I think too much about everything, like when I’m alone I think about death and random thoughts come in mind, like when I read about other people who have serious illnesses like cancer, I start to think, what if I am diagnosed with brain tumour in the future or any other cancer etc. I know it’s stupid but I don’t know how to get rid of these thoughts. It’s literally killing me"

"I’m a 25F and had an emergency c section a little over 2 months ago. During that time my grandfather who lives with us was in the hospital as well - with a blood clot in his leg that he most likely got from his surgery weeks prior (stomach ulcer) then in the hospital he experienced a heart attack.
 

 Since after my c section surgery I’ve had weird symptoms like muscle twitching, muscle weakness and soreness, all especially in my left leg. The pain and aches come and go, get better and get worse on some days.
 Currently I’m experiencing left knee soreness, popping and clicking and a bruised like feeling on my front thigh above my knee. I also get some weakness in the back of my calf’s as well as the front part of my leg. Whenever I feel the pain in my calf’s or my thigh I automatically get panicked thinking it’s a blood clot. (My leg isn’t red, hot and doesn’t look swollen - to me or others )
 

 I am “low normal”on vitamin b12 (264) and iron (34) - and getting my folate, thyroid panel results most likely tomorrow. I’m hoping all these symptoms are from my vitamin levels, hormones but of course my brain can never accept that especially when google is the worst place for me to go."
"I’ve been going through random dips in mood where I get guilty and really anxious because I think that I’m talking about myself too much to others. I also feel like people secretly don’t really like me because of how self centred I am. Sometimes when my husband tells me things, I just zone out and it makes me feel awful for seeming like I don’t care. I talk about my issues to him all the time and I have very low self esteem so that often becomes a subject of conversation. Sometimes I feel like I’m just floating along with all my issues and that’s all I think about or know. My brain feels exhausted. I obviously know that other things are going on around me and that there is lots to be interested in, many other lives other than mine, and people that have more problems than me. I just feel like an awful person for not being present. I’m generally an introvert and socially anxious person. I just want to know if anyone has gotten this or knows a solution, or something that would help me stop thinking about myself or be so anxious about this. Thank you!!"
"Sometimes I won't be anxious just sitting there working or whatever and I'll get this wave of sensation like my body is moving even when it isn't?
 

 Usually only lasts like 5 seconds. 
 

 Then my adrenaline spikes. 
 

 Hard to explain."
"I was doing well recently going to the gym and feeling good. 
 

 Just went to the shop and when walking suddenly felt sick, dizzy and heart started pounding, literally felt like I was going to faint. 
 

 Didn't faint and managed to get back to the car. 
 

 I'm just terrified and frustrated because everytime I feel like I'm getting somewhere something like this happens. 
 

 I've had echo, ECG, 3 day ECG, stress test all normal. 
 

 But I'm terrified they've missed something and this is some dodgy heart rhythm that is going to end killing me. 
 

 Sorry for the rant, just don't want to keep ranting to my partner as she has enough going on without me stressing her out even more. 
 

 I just cannot see how this is anxiety, when these pre syncope episodes happen it's basically everything they tell you would happen if your heart had entered a dangerous rhythm. 
 

 I just don't want to ignore this and it turns out to be something deadly and kills me so early in my life.
 

 I'm on 15mg mitrazapine which is helping because haven't had a single full blown panic attack since. It's just this physical stuff that keeps setting me back.
 

 I still feel sick now, waves of dizziness and feeling like it's a matter of time before this kills me."
"Hello. I am 28 years old and back in January (8 months ago) I had what I can only describe as a “mental break down”. I have always been a little bit of a hypochondriac, but it had gotten much better as I’ve gotten older. Until 8 months ago, I started having chest pains, going to so many doctors that said nothing was wrong but I couldn’t believe it. It wasn’t even three chest pain that bothered me the most, it was the anxiety I was feeling. Eventually my anxiety got out of control and it felt like my brain snapped. I remember the exact moment, it just felt like I would never be okay or the same again. The next several months were filled with unexplainable terror. I think I developed a dissociative disorder and I spent every moment of every day feeling like I was in some kind of purgatory hellish nightmare. I never experienced any hallucinations or delusions unless hypochondria counts as a delusion. I tried medications that all made it worse. Benzos helped, but I didn’t want to become dependent so I stopped taking them. Now 8 months later I just feel…. Broken? Charged forever. My whole frame of mind and reality seems altered. I go through my day, I spend time with loved ones, I do things that are good for me and I work on controlling my anxiety. Everyone around me says I’ve made so much improvement. But it feels like I’m just acting, like faking it til I make it but perpetually. It feels like I i started improving and now this is as good as it gets. My brain just feels like it functions differently now. Things look different (I think this is depersonalization/derealization disorder) which I read is caused by anxiety/trauma or some times just happens on its own. But I just feel hyperaware of my own existence and the existence of everything. Like I’m outside of the human experience looking in. My thoughts and feelings are distressing, constant and exhausting. It’s like I’ve become afraid of my own mind, afraid of not being able to live a normal life because of this and persistent fears of being severely mentally ill, despite my therapist, psychiatrist and several other doctors telling me otherwise. I’m on here I guess for some insight if anyone has experienced something similar and maybe just some support from people who are like me."
"My depression does get the best of me when it comes to any relationship or any friendship and I wonder why certain things happen even when I feel like there not suppose to happen. I either give my all or give very little but no matter how I see it. It’s not ever enough like what happened to valuing someone or anyone instead of treating them like they didn’t matter in the first place I try to stay positive.but when I pay attention and see how things are. It just fucks me up because I know it shouldn’t be like that at all. I tolerated a lot and I’ve dealt with so much of being misunderstood or even having the person say what they mean. But the majority of time it’s just bs and I rather not believe anything at all.. I’m either to much of bitch or just to sensitive like idk what to do or how to feel at this point.. 
 

 Needing some advice"
"So I've been on 15mg for a few months. Was working well, but today I had another episode of pre syncope. 
 

 So my GP has suggested going up to 30mg.
 

 What should I expect in terms of size effects? Or will it just have a better impact on helping ease my anxiety?"
"[https://imgur.com/PfyA5dN](https://imgur.com/PfyA5dN)
 

 Refuse to look back when I'm older wishing I had tried. I've been at it to improve myself for a couple months already, and it has not been easy, far from it. I've cried from the stress more times this past month than I have in my entire life. But that just means I am a human making a change.
 

 I try not to think about the past/what I missed out on, it makes me feel sick to my stomach. Taking it day by day. Like earlier this week had a family get together at a restaurant which was already hard enough as is, and my siblings successes of their partner's, friend groups, and professional jobs were praised by my parents all night. Felt like my throat was closing, couldn't have felt worse as many here have experienced in those situations. But - I have to keep my chin up and keep the momentum moving forward. I have some clearly defined goals I'm working toward, and I fully believe I can do it if I keep giving it my best each day no matter how hard. Love you all, thanks for listening."
"I’ve been having pain in my left leg after my emergency c section 3 months ago. My iron and vb12 are low but I went into the ER to check just in case it’s something else like nerve damage or blood clot.
 I’m waiting for my results but I’m panicking. I’m worried if it is a blood clot or cancer or MS. I’m alone as my husband is working and my mother is at home watching my son. I really need positive feelings at the moment"
"I'm 28 M and currently on my 8th day of taking Renuvie before bed time and Zolodin during the day. I've started feeling some benefits with regards to getting longer sleep. Not sure with the other aspects though. I haven't had a panic episode since I started taking them but I'm also on a two-week leave from work so it can probably be attributed to that. If everything goes well, it looks like I will be taking these two for quite some time. I was wondering, what are the common side effects?"
"And I couldn't handle my heart beating so fast that I had to walk out. Lol! I'm so useless
 

  I knew literally everyone there, and I just couldn't muster up the courage to talk with anyone. So, I stayed there for like two minutes and walked out. Feels bad but I don't know why I do that or how to overcome that. I'm also quite good at dancing and have been part of dancing group before, but still I didn't have even an ounce of courage to dance with my mates."

"Hi all, I have suffered from anxiety &amp; panic disorders since I was 15 years old. I'm 26 now. Since late 2017, I have been in active treatment. Since then, I've had multiple forms of therapy, tried about 13 different medications, and nothing helps, except for high doses of xanax. In fact, my issues have only gotten worse. More anxiety, all day long, for weeks or months without pause. I'm most afraid of getting panic attacks, and losing control over mind &amp; body. Getting panic attacks in itself is dreadful, but getting them when I'm out and about or meeting people or in public transport or social events, makes it 10x more terrifying. I have tried exposure therapy in the past. It never worked. Mostly because me and my psychologist tried to induce panic attacks in her office during a time period where I was doing well and feeling confident and the panic attacks we tried to induce or simulate never came on. I'm in the worst period of my life since May last year. 1,5 years of pure hell. And since nothing works, I think continuous exposure therapy might be my only way out without being sedated. But my psychologist doesn't have the resources to go out into the real world with me to do this together. So how do I approach this? How do I apply exposure therapy to myself in a responsible &amp; effective way?"
"Hi, I am 28M (straight). I had unprotected sex with girl about 8 years ago. I treat with anxiety because I am afraid of many illnesses. 
 I found that I have plaque on tongue and started searching on Google. It showed me possible HIV. I got panic attack. Fu** Google 
 So I sent pictures of my tongue to many doctors and they told me it is normal tongue.
 However I bought OraQuick saliva test and it came negative. So can I trust this test after 8 years of exposure? I read on the internet that it can give false negative. So I am worried. I swabbed my upper and lower gums twice instead once.
 Also with my cousin (straight), we are like brothers, so when we were younger about 18 years we gave each other our blood. Like fraternity closure. However I know that he is very decent person (no drugs, etc.) He actually has girlfriend. 
 I have also girlfriend and we have son, so she tested on HIV in pregnancy and she is negative. 
 I have no symptoms only plaque on tongue.

"Hello everyone, I'm extremely nervous because I have my first driver's test on Wed. I've been driving off and on for at least 6 years and never had an accident. The biggest thing for me is doing the test. I'm 26 and when I was 17 I had an awful driving instructor that made me terrified of driving. I've done better since then but I'm afraid of being judged again. I've scheduled some tests before but canceled them out of fear. Does anyone have any good breathing techniques while driving? My mind is racing thinking of everything that could go wrong."
What exactly is your daily routine if even going outside causes anxiety?
I am 27 and need to get my license. I have horrible panic disorder and have been pushing it off. Does anyone have any thoughts on how to over come this? Have you done a certain therapy or something? Its making me feel like a child.

 This week I made an algorithm that looked into 20.000+ therapists/psychologists and their public reviews.
 

 This ranking is the result of the very best in treating social anxiety based on reviews, ratings, and recommendations. All of these provide online/tele therapy. Hope you like it :)!

"So lately I M25 have been super worried about my health and have been having panic attacks and a constant feeling of dread has been filling me for awhile now. The reason is that I have a yellow lump on my left tonsil I have had it there since 2014 or 2016 because I remember being worried about it back then, but me being young and irresponsible I never ended up getting it check out. Well now it’s been about 6 or 8 years of me having this lump in my throat and I can’t stop worrying about it being a cancerous tumor or something and since I neglected it to get it checked out now I might have cancer spread all over my body. I’ve been getting neck pain as well so I fear that whatever it is may have spread to my lymph nodes there or something. The last time I had a physical at the doctors was in 2019 and everything seemed normal on my blood tests. I just keep thinking about how I might have something wrong when they do blood tests on me. The worst part is that I don’t have my appointment until the 30th of this month and so I have just been worrying about what might be wrong when the doctor checks my throat. Not only that but then I have to wait for the GP doctor to give me a referral for an ENT doctor and I don’t know how long that will take. Do any of you have advice for someone that’s going through waiting for a doctors appointment? I keep thinking the worst and don’t know how to stop. 
 

 TL;DR I have a yellow lump on one of my tonsils. It has been there for years either 6 or 8. I have never gotten it checked out and now fear the worst when it comes to my doctor visit. The appointment isn’t until the end of the month so I just want some advice on managing this constant anxiety happening to me until then."
"I've had it for about a week now, I'm obsessing over it. It's not constant and not sharp/stabbing pain. It's kinda like getting squeezed from inside. 
 The weird part is sometimes i feel it below the ribs, sometimes on them, sometimes on my chest, or goes to the side. I'm concerned about tumors, of course"
"Am 27 years old, struggled my entire life with small talk and talking in groups.
 

 Today my 2nd week at the new job started and when I came to the office a few coworkers stood in the office entrance and chatted. When I arrived they all focused on me, greeted me smiling and asked me questions, but I dont even remember what they asked me. I just instantly got panic and anxiety, froze, couldnt focus on what to say or what they said. Couldnt smile or look them in the eyes, my mouth started twitching, when I tried to smile. Just mumbled that I'm still half asleep and wished them a good morning and then quickly went to my working space. 
 

 

 Experiences like this are soo painful, especially seeing everyone else at the office being able to shit chat and laugh with their coworkers. 
 

 How do I get through this? How can I improve this? Right now I just feel so extremly uncomfortable there and wish I wasnt working with other people."
"I noticed that compared to now, about a year ago I would studder while talking. I’ve never studdered like that and I don’t have a studder so I found it odd. I know why and I know what I’ve done to talk as fluent as I used to but what do you guys think? What’s your experience on this?

"(Sorry I don't know anything about formating, 1st time I'm posting in reddit &amp; I am on mobile)
 

 I'm 26F and I've been out of work since Aug. 2019, so 3 years now. I graduated Bachelor of Arts in Psychology in 2016, took &amp; passed licensure exam for Psychomertician the same year (already expired). My previous work experiences are all in Human Resources, so it's even more ironic that I am scared as hell to apply for work. Even when I'm doing well in a job I have, I would feel that the work is unbearable for some reason, start having panic attacks &amp; then resign. Most of my previous work are all short term because of this. 
 

 When I resigned from my last work, I wasn't planning to be unemployed this long. I quickly tried to apply for work but whenever I would get an interview invite, I would prepare the night before to go then what would happen is I would be shaking so much from the thought of traveling there that I would end up cancelling. Then it transformed into not getting any sleep when I know I have an interview the next day. Worsened into I can't even look for job posting anymore because it makes me anxious. Then the pandemic occured in 2020 which just made my anxiety worse, &amp; I honestly just wanted to end my life then because I felt useless.
 

 

 I am being provided for by my mom &amp; living with my brother for free &amp; they've been as understanding as they can be but I don't wanna be this way anymore. In these 3 years, I have finally garnered the courage to edit my resume, &amp; I was planning to review some interview questions so I would be prepared if &amp; when I get an interview but I can't bring myself to look at the questions &amp; because of this I feel like I can't apply for any posting because I'm scared they would call &amp; I won't have anything to answer. I would end up doing self-soothing stuff like watching tv series or browsing on the internet &amp; tell myself when I calm down I will do what I have to do but then the whole day has passed &amp; I have not answered a single question. 
 

 I hate myself more everyday. I hate myself more whenever I receive money from my family. I hate myself knowing I am a burden to them. I seem to be stuck &amp; don't know how to move from here. I'm scared I'll never be able to move from here. I have been thinking of getting professional help but I don't have the money for it, I cannot bear to ask my family for it (we are not well off) &amp; I'm also so scared of reaching out. I am at the point of anxiety that even going out alone makes me really anxious. 
 

 The most frustrating thing is I should know I can be good at my job, I've always done really well in my previous jobs, even my friends &amp; family say so but I can't seem to overcome these fear &amp; doubts. I just start trembling &amp; feeling nauseous whenever I think about applying again.
 

 I don't even know why I'm posting this, is it just to get it off my chest or to ask for help? I honestly don't know anymore. Sorry"

"I’ve suffered from anxiety since I can remember. It is mainly because of emotional abuse from my parents which has also not helped my decision making ability. Over my twenties it manifested into paralyzingly panic attacks and I sought counselling. It helped with not getting to that point anymore. After losing my job over Covid I went on anti depressants and continued with a different counsellor. It’s helped me feel more in control over all. But I still can’t seem to make decisions about my life, and my parents are still the only people I can “lean on” for larger life advice. I can’t really trust them, and my anxiety tells me I can’t trust myself
 

 I have lived between Canada and my home country for my twenties, and can’t decide which I want to commit my 30’s to. I’ve tried to envision both but my gut is so undecided.
 

 I’m still single, so I am finding it hard to decide to make an investment in a home. I have a 50k (euro) job and my anxiety tells me it’s not enough money. I have 35k in savings and no debt and everywhere I read it says it’s not enough to do anything on a single income. I have no one to talk to about it, because no one I know is in a similar position.
 

 Going to work everyday can be so jarring and I want the job for savings like everyone else. The social inconsistencies of the workplace (my boss putting me down in front of the client, the client being rude, team mates not getting along) really hurt me. Especially when blamed for things that aren’t my fault. I can’t sleep at night dwelling on them. And I can’t find a solution. I’ve made myself sick this last week from being run down by worry. I can never tell if it’s my anxiety or a bad workplace or both.
 

 I have a driving licence but I am too afraid to drive because my parents embedded in me not to and it’s not worth the money and dangerous. When I do visit them they use the car as a tool to control my sisters and me. Once my mam told my aunt right in front of me that I don’t have a licence, and I couldn’t believe it. Then anxiety tells me that if I do drive, I will piss a lot of people off and be in trouble. 
 

 My anxiety has paralyzed me from making foundations, or committing to doing anything. I feel so alone. I can’t seem to support my own wants and needs, or make solid decisions and end up in inactive worrying cycles. Aren’t these just regular life things? It feels like life is slipping through my hands
 

 If you felt paralyzed by anxiety, how did you get past it? Or through it?"
"So a bit of a long post….
 

 I’ve always wanted to pursue music as a career. It’s always been my passion and my biggest dream. However, I come from a very conservative family, and my parents have always been unsupportive of my ‘unconventional’ dream.
 

 So I grew up in a very abusive household, my dad would physically abuse me and my younger brother literally everyday, like everything we did would trigger him. His side of the family were very abusive, though not physically, but mentally and emotionally. 
 

 My dad was strictly against anything he would consider to be ‘unconventional’.
 

 Music for me, was kinda like a way to escape all the abuse I went through as a child, I loved to dance and sing, and I knew that is what I wanted to do in life. But my dad was really against it, especially because I’m a girl. My dad always used to associate dancing with stripping, and he would always say that it’s a disgraceful thing. Even as a child as young as 8 years old, I wasn’t allowed to dance in front of any male member of the family, because my dad felt that was a shameless thing for a young girl.
 

 I was so scared of him so I didn’t dare convince him to let me follow my dream. Well I actually did try once and he flipped out. And that was enough for me to never try again.
 

 I’ve been so miserable working jobs I have no interest in, but that fear is still there. I have severe social anxiety and I suffer from panic attacks. The thought of never giving my dream a go sometimes trigger the attacks.
 

 Now I’m in my mid 20s and I still want to pursue music. But I feel very inferior especially when I think about artists who have way more experience and who have basically been associated with music their whole lives. I have no experience at all. Most people start as young as 5/6 years old. But I haven’t even started yet. And that’s what makes me think that is it too late now? Is it even worth giving it a go now?"
"So a bit of a long post….
 

 I’ve always wanted to pursue music as a career. It’s always been my passion and my biggest dream. However, I come from a very conservative family, and my parents have always been unsupportive of my ‘unconventional’ dream.
 

 So I grew up in a very abusive household, my dad would physically abuse me and my younger brother literally everyday, like everything we did would trigger him. His side of the family were very abusive, though not physically, but mentally and emotionally. 
 

 My dad was strictly against anything he would consider to be ‘unconventional’.

"28F Diagnosed ADHD + anxiety since a child.
 

 I have always been a very happy, energetic, passionate person, despite having anxiety. I love my life, have great friends, family, an awesome job, safe and secure. I have a ton of hobbies. I have very little daily troubles, I am not rich or had a perfect upbringing by any means, but I have coped well. I never drank heavily, never smoked tobacco, smoked weed in college for anxiety + panic attacks, but now just use CBD drops.
 

 But one year ago, I developed the absolute worst chronic symptoms I have ever had. I just lost my dream job, there was a lot of drama. Following that event, I developed heightened daily anxiety, tons of panic attacks, and 24/7 lightheadedness. Currently, within the last two weeks the lightheadedness turned into a bit of dizziness and off balance. It is very difficult to walk. 
 

 Doctors are stumped as to if its anxiety or something else. I have seen 4 doctors, plus specialists for heart and all my tests come back 100% normal. I have no deficiencies. But my panic and anxiety is through the roof. Both physical, and mental symptoms. And whether I feel anxious or not, the 24/7 lightheadedness remains.
 

 I am terrified to try any meds, never been on any aside from CBD. SSRIs and antidepressants scare the living shit out of me. I would probably entertain the idea of an occasional xanax, but I have no idea how to cut this damn lightheadedness. Its 24/7. When I sleep, when I wake up, when I rest or sit, or walk, always lightheaded. Plenty of days I have no panic or anxiety, but the lightheadedness is still there. I have a friend who went through something extremely similar, and he took xanax and it all but cured it. 
 

 Has anyone else had this 24/7 fight or flight response? I am at wits end, it's effecting my job now because looking at screens makes me dizzy. 
 

 Sorry for the novel, but its just such a strange issue I have been dealing with."

 Keep getting these spells where I'm walking and suddenly I get this episode of almost like pre syncope. Where my body will suddenly feel really heavy l and then I can feel my heart pounding. 
 

 Usually resolves in like a minute. 
 

 Terrifying me that I've got some sort of abnormal heart rhythm which is eventually going to kill me. Or that covid has in some way damaged my heart and current tests can't pick up the damage. 
 

 I realise how irrational that thought is. 
 

 Gets to the point now where I'm scared to even go for a walk on my own in case I collapse and no one's there to help me."
"Hello! I (29F) was officially diagnosed with generalized anxiety a couple years ago and have been on Lexapro since. I feel like I’ve had anxiety since high school though and I just never had the courage to seek help until a couple years ago when Covid freaked me the F out and I thought we were all gonna die 😂🫠. 
 

 While the Lexapro helps with my normal day-to-day stuff, I think I’m still having major anxiety attacks every few months. I’m currently coming down from a 2-day “attack” now. This one started because a coworker was being a complete a-hole to me and my brain took his comments and spiraled out of control with it, eventually leading me to believe that I’m absolute trash at my job and that everyone hates me. 
 

 Every time I have these attacks I cry uncontrollably and can’t even speak. After crying for a few minutes I start to hyperventilate and can feel the blood pulsing through my body and my ears start to ring. This will go on for about 10 minutes and then I’m able to compose myself for a while but I’ll have multiple little crying sessions for a day or two before I’m okay again. 
 

 It’s so bad because it happens in front of people and I literally cannot make it stop until it runs it’s course. If they ask me if I’m okay I just get worse and sob/panic even more because then I start thinking about how stupid I must look to them. Today this all happened in a zoom meeting with my boss. I’m so embarrassed because I feel like someone my age should not be breaking down into tears over something so small/stupid. And looking back on the situation I’m even more embarrassed that I let my coworker get to me like that.
 

 My previous/similar attacks have been caused by rude customers, constructive criticism, me feeling like I royally messed something up, having to deliver bad news to people, or just me spiraling into depressing thoughts about being single and alone forever. It doesn’t happen with every bad interaction though. Like I know how to maintain my composure and be a professional 9.5 times out of 10. 
 

 My question is, do y’all think I’m experiencing legitimate anxiety attacks or am I just an overly sensitive cry baby?"
"Sorry for the long post friends, I need to vent.
 

 I (25f) went to my favourite singers concert tonight. Payed a hefty sum for tickets and was excited for over a year to go - we are talking can’t sleep Christmas Eve levels of excited.
 

 I waited in line, got in my seat, but the moment the loud music and crowd screaming started I just crumbled. I tried everything my therapist told me to do and I calmed down, but a few songs later it came back. I told my family I had to leave and they came with me, we spent the rest of the concert in the lobby where you could still hear the music- but at a manageable level.
 

 My family were very supportive of this, saying ‘well we don’t really like this artist that much and we only came for you’. 
 

 I just can’t help but feel completely gutted, disappointed and angry at myself- I ruined their night and a years worth of hype crumbled.
 

 How does everyone cope with concerts?
 And how do I stop kicking myself?"
Thank you to everyone who helped me and gave me support. I just passed my first driver's test! I'm shocked. Now to get used to driving on my own.
"I'm currently on duloxotine for my anxiety/depression and fibromyalgia. It seems to cover my mental anxiety symptoms but I'm realizing lately that I can mentally feel like I'm not anxious but my body is telling me a different story. 
 

 I may feel calm and chill for a job interview, or to even just leave my apartment and suddenly I'm super hot and sweating bullets...whixh is extremely embarrassing with sweat literally dripping down my face that I will end up feeling anxious. 
 

 Also, I've been chronically getting ""anxiety"" nightmares where I'll wake up frequently in the night or be trapped in a dream and know it's a dream and desperately am trying to wake myself up with no luck....essentially having anxiety attacks when I'm asleep but not awake. 
 

 

 I don't really want to ask to up the duloxotine because it's already a high dose and it's very expensive and has horrific withdrawal symptoms if I ever have to go off of it. 
 

 I'm wondering about CBD oils or other products?

 I am on: 
 

 30mg act amphetamine

"What do you do to calm you down, alleviate your stress, or make you forget those moments? For me, I’m quite logical so I tend to over analyze the situation to rationalize why I shouldn’t be anxious. This process uses so much brainpower that I eventually forget why I’m thinking about it in the first place."
"Can your mind convince yourself that your abdominal area hurts? I can't stop thinking about it and I get this annoying feeling on the right side. It sort of varies and moves around. Sometimes goes to the back, sometimes it's on the chest, or goes down to besides the belly button .. Im obsessed with it of course. It's not sharp pain, just annoying and sometimes it feels like I'm being squished from inside. Could it be just my mind? Maybe gas?"
"I (F26) met this boy around a year ago, and we both had feelings for each other, but I couldn't enter a relationship due to my severe anxiety around men/sex/relationships. I put our relationship on a hold to sort out my anxiety with a therapist, and she dropped the huge revelation on me that I had been raped when I was younger. I really need to work through this trauma with my therapist before I am ready for any kind of relationship, but getting any appointments scheduled is really taking a long time.
 

 How long is it ok to make a potential partner wait for you while you go through rape trauma theraphy?"
"I’m thinking all over again on how I’m such an horrible person. Like I’m no good for anything any person I’ve ever cared about left and it’s time and time again that happens… always questioning is something wrong with myself.. cause I’ve done so much for people that do me wrong but later on they do a lot for the people that they leave me for.. one of my friends told me before they left why I do I give to those that hurt me? And why haven’t I gotten cold hearted.. 
 

 I just believed sometimes there’s hope in people but then I see why I should just leave everyone alone.. cause no matter how hard you convince yourself people are different and things will get better it does get better to an certain extent.. and you will always find yourself alone.. 
 

 Advice on trying to get better ❤️‍🩹"
"I am 25 years old and have been struggling with social anxiety since i was 17-18, and i am tired of this feeling. It's interpersonally so demoralizing to watch a friendship getting affected due to my social anxiety. I was talking to this girl and she has been a good friend to me for a few months. She used to return texts fast and talked in an upbeat manner. But since about a week she has been talking in a very formal manner and not replying to my texts even after being online. I feel so helpless because i know it's prolly my social anxiety that has caused me to say or do something stupid and now i don't know how to mend these fences. I know for a fact that it is me who did something because there's no other explanation. Things don't change so fast and she's a normal neurotypical girl.
 

 I have felt like this innumerable times and it is simply devastating.
 

 Have any of you felt this way? If so how do you deal with the feelings?"

"My anxiety has come to the point where it's physically affecting me and I don't know if there's any point in doing something about it. And if there is what should I do? My heart beat will quicken, my head will start to get hot, I'll feel dizzy and so scared to where it feels like I'm in danger. It sometimes happens randomly with no triggers. I don't want to feel like this anymore, it fucking sucks. Should I talk to someone? Should I take medication? Also how can I tell if I'm having regular anxiety or panic/anxiety attacks?"
"This sounds absolutely pathetic but there’s lot that’s lead up to this point and I just feel like my anxiety is just getting worse. 
 

 Firstly my boyfriend (33M) and I (28F) have been together for about a year, so still fairly new in certain aspects. It’s been great, we were planning on moving in together but this month I told that I didn’t feel ready to move in with him. Of course I feel as though that has caused some tension I think and I’ve spiralled a lot since then. 
 

 A few friends planned a themed night out this weekend. I told him a week in advance that I didn’t feel up to going out, he said he wasn’t bothered either and that we’d have a movie night in and get take out together. 
 But after he spoke to his brother a few days ago he suddenly decided to go out without me. 
 

 I just felt abit hurt that he changed his plans with me and now I feel as though my mind is going over drive thinking of the reasons he changed his mind and that I’m being burden on him. I’m coming up with scenarios that he’ll meet other girls tonight. 
 

 This is only just a few things leading up to this point that’s making me worry but I feel like I shouldn’t be in a relationship. I don’t want to be hurt and I don’t want to hurt him. 
 

 How do you know when to let someone go? 
 I feel as though I’m in a constant cycle of self hate."

"For about the past year or so, I've been having wavey or 'spinning energy"" sensations in the left back side of my brain / head. It mostly comes up when I'm anxious. The feeling comes and goes. This physical sensation sometimes makes it hard to concentrate, or focus on certain tasks. My right side of my brain feels completely normal.
 

 My doctors don't know what it is and just look at me funny. But my therapist suspects it might be anxiety.
 

 Has anyone else experienced this head sensation before? Tried researching this and couldn't find anything on it."
"My anxiety has been really bad lately but after doing some new stuff (screaming into my pillow, hitting the punching bag, talking with real people on vr chat, and exorcises) I have been feeling better these past few days. But does anybody else feel like there going through life without caring about anything when there not anxious? I feel like a robot or an npc just doing daily tasks. Like I'm in a dream or something."
"I (26f) have never been diagnosed with anxiety or any mood/behavior disorder. I think I might have borderline personality but I’m not 100% certain.
 

 Anyway, I have had three full on panic attacks in one week. One was regarding going to my boyfriends work party, one was going to a work convention, and today I had one because I am going to my very judgmental grandmother’s house and I don’t want her to point out that I’ve let myself go a bit LOL
 

 They start with just me feeling general discontent and kinda being in a bad mood. This can last from 10min to literally hours. Then, I go through such intense feelings of hatred for what I am about to do (example, go to the work party, go to the convention, go to my grandma’s) and it makes me very resentful and rude towards everyone. I get almost mean. Then, it’ll happen where I just can’t take it and cry and my chest feels off and I feel ridiculous for crying and letting small silly things get to me. After, I feel much better but still have a baseline of general discontent. I go through with my commitments and ultimately the thing that caused my breakdown. 
 

 Would you classify this as anxiety? Have you gone through this or something similar? Can you recommend any coping mechanisms or advice?
 

 TLDR I think I am having anxiety attacks (3 in one week) and I don’t know how to handle them"
i'm struggling so hard with social anxiety. i feel like i don't know how to talk to people. i've already been at my job for almost 2 months and i'm still not fully comfortable and nobody really knows me. i feel like i have nothing to say so i just don't talk unless someone talks to me and i can't stand it. i want to be talkative and outgoing and be able to make friends but why is it so hard? i think i also closed myself up so much because i'm afraid of people thinking i'm weird or annoying that i just don't let anyone know me. every single day i feel so anxious and thinking that i don't know how to talk to people it just replays in my mind over and over. i hate going to work i hate going to school because i don't feel like a normal person it feels like there's something wrong with me. i was thinking about starting a conversation with someone every day to try to get better but i don't know how to start conversations. i don't know how to get past this and i'm scared this is going to kill me i can't live like this i don't want to be like this anymore
"I've had them for days. It's not constant, and not as bad as to being unable to walk or breathe. Just randome stabbing pains, and sometimes feel bloated and tight. I'm under insane amounts of stress and health anxiety, and my diet basically consists of pasta and tea, since it's all I can afford at the moment. I'm worried about cancer, of course, although there's no signs of blood in stool, and no vomiting either"
"My brother is always in and out of the hospital with him being bipolar who does not take his meds. My mom calls the cops or the hospital when she is afraid of him and so they bring him to the hospital, but he always leaves when he thinks he is better and the hospital does not stop him because he is 27. He is not violent, he just makes my mom uncomfortable when he has his episodes. Every time he leaves the hospital he comes to our house and Mom lets him back in and the cycle continues. She always asks me what to do but then she goes against the advice of everyone and lets him back in the house thinking that the police or an ambulance will clean up her mess. By the way, I live with my mom and this is affecting me and I am trying to get my anxiety on track with medication but going through these episodes with my brother and my mom calling the police make me spiral. I do yoga to calm me down, I read, I listen to music, I write, but nothing is helping. I am also trying to move because I think my mom is never going to stop taking him in; I know she feels compassion for him and I do too, but I hate seeing her like this because she is going to retire in a few years and the stress is literally killing her. If she wants to do this, I cannot be here to watch her. By the way, I am 29 years old living with my mom."
"I 25F am having a mental health breakdown right now. My anxiety is killing me. I already called in sick to work Friday to have a breakdown at home. 
 

 It was my weekend off.
 

 Today I am having another mental health breakdown. I don't feel like I can go to work tomorrow. 
 

 My job does not keep my busy. It's boring and repetitive and requites a lot of patience. 90% there is nothing to do and that is too much free time. 
 

 I can't do it tomorrow. I will fall out. I am thinking about committing myself.
 

 Idk what I'm asking besides help. I will have $2,443.36 in savings tomorrow.
 

 What should my plan be if I quit tomorrow?"
"It's my first ""real"" job, and I'm 28. Anxiety kicked my ass for the majority of my 20s (and teenage years).
 

 Since November last year I work at a library, 5 minutes from my house, with people I've known all my life and who are pretty accommodating... and for the past month I absolutely despise it. 
 

 February - March was a fckng nightmare bc my previous boss was not only a thief, a liar and a pos who showed her true colours only after some time, but she tried to drag me into her stealing. My anxiety was off the roof, understandably, thankfully I've been on therapy and it helped me go through. It only improved once my previous boss went on maternity leave and didn't come back. 
 

 But since I came back from my holidays in August, something broke. First thing first I got told by my current boss that I make a lot of mistakes and to get myself together. Well, surely I'd make less of them if I had someone to teach me everything, or most of it - nobody did. My previous boss didn't teach me much, and if she did, it was wrong which I was later reprimanded for. 
 

 And month later, last Friday, once I got back from one day long sick leave, I was told I don't work enough, that I missed two holidays and my boss had to fix that (as if it wasn't her job??), that there are no visible results of my work, that I've changed since I came back from the holidays and just...
 

 The thing is, even with my anxiety, I just... I didn't care. I was only slightly stressed, and then I just went back to fixing my mistakes and doing what I was doing. Only during the weekend my anxiety but also frustration and anger, heightened, and now I'm sitting at work anxious. 
 

 I'm not a librarian, just finished my administrative technician school, and with nobody to guide me, I still don't know much and I make mistakes. And thinking about staying here makes me feel hopeless and sometimes down suicidal.
 

 I started to look for jobs, but haven't sent a cv yet - it paralyses me with fear, but so does thinking I'm stuck here for who knows how long. 
 

 The environment is fckng toxic - the office games, the political stuff (as we're close to the county office), the people living here are very... characteristic, prone to gossip and being awful, I have to watch my every step even after leaving work... 
 

 My boss who I admired and thought was pretty understanding, seems to bit off more than she can chew, having three jobs at once. She whines about how much work she has and that I'm supposed to help her with, but... I don't care. Resign if it's too much for you! Right now I'm kind of her assistant - which I wasn't told earlier that I would be. I hate it. I'm a librarian on a minimum wage, not an assistant, not a secretary. She's also pretty homophobic, what doesn't help. 
 

 My only coworker is a fckng snitch, what is expected of us - and my boss says she build a good team! She did not! I'm not going to snitch, I don't care about gossip and political games. 
 

 But thinking about changing job is scary. Even when I'm trying to let the frustration fuel me. The inflation in Poland is 16%, we have fuel shortages, I'm lucky in living with my dad and his girlfriend so I know I won't be left hungry but... I really, really want to get away from here. The ongoing crisis is the only thing stopping me, and adding to my anxiety. 
 

 I take Prozac and go to therapy, I have Xanax prescribed for when I feel especially awful - took it last night and it didn't help much!
 

 I'm honestly so... confused. So frustrated, angry, sad, disappointed, I hate this job with a passion. My therapist was all for changing the jobs, said that I outgrew this place, but recently she also agreed that keeping the job might be a responsible idea - but I hate it so fckng much. My psychiatrist said that a job being stable is very important - but my mental health is anything but stable rn.
 

 I have no idea what to do. I know finding a job might be a long process, but it still scares me. On the other hand... I have no family to be responsible for, I only applied to uni so I don't even know if it'll be another responsibility. When i didn't have a job I helped my sister on her farm and with her kids, so she helped me financially. But I don't want to worry her. 
 

 Idk why I'm writing this. Mostly I need to let it all out, but I also hope there are people who went through it and can tell me what they did. I'm so lost."
"I've posted here before, maybe having something more specific rather than just a long rant about my anxiety will get me useful responses. I've been feeling a ton of anxiety for the past few months, I just got into my first year teaching at a contracted position and my wife and I just bought a house. Last weekend, she told me that having to handle me needing excessive amounts of emotional support over and over again exhausts her and has made her resentful. She said to my parents that she really can't take me having another OCD episode where I am debilitated and I go to her for reassurance or expect her to fix it for me. I'm having a difficult time with my job, its 45 minutes away and at a low-income, urban school. She made it clear that if I quit, that would show that I am ""abandoning"" my responsibility to our family (just us and two dogs) and that would be a deal-breaker for us remaining together. I have seen an OCD therapist in person for about 4 months, that was 7 years ago before we met. Now I am seeing a teletherapist with NOCD. I feel like at this point, I can only partially apply ERP, whenever there's a perceived threat to my relationship with my wife it's like I can't tolerate any doubt or uncertainty whatsoever. I have an appointment with my physician today and I have a phone consultation with Rogers Behavioral Health in Seattle tomorrow. They do ""partial hospitalization"" which is actually 6 hours of therapy 5 days a week for several weeks, its really more of an intensive treatment for OCD. Has anybody had any experience with Rogers? Its technically out-of-network but my wife's insurance is doing an in-network-request for me. This all was put in motion because last week after the conversation with my wife I slept 4 hours a night for 5 straight days then I slept zero hours thursday night, asked my wife to please not leave me and cried in the middle of the night. My dad and I spent all day on the phone with doctors and insurance and since I haven't completely responded to once-a-week OCD therapy, it may be that I need a more intensive treatment option. I don't know if I qualify for PFML and we did just buy a house. We have about 17k saved. Literally any input is appreciated."
"I hardly ever tell people I don't drive, because it feels so unusual. I'm 25, and everyone I know drives. I got my driver's license at 18, when I passed the test, but hardly drove after that. I went to college in a city where I'd walk places, and when I'd have to go further, I'd bother my sister to drive me places. 
 

  Now I'm 25 with my license and I have a car that is unreliable so I am too scared to use it on the highway. I'll probably use it to drive shorter distances and practice a bit, but I'm going to start saving up for a newer car. 
 

  One of the most embarrassing things is probably getting dropped off and picked up at work, while all of my coworkers drive. 
 

  That's my story, with driving anyway. Thought some of y'all might relate."
"Does anyone else feel more anxious/depressed than usual on their birthday? I’m turning 26 and just feel…I don’t know. Not happy about it I guess, lol. I’ve never liked birthdays (too much attention) but it’s gotten worse over the years. 
 

 And my birthday blues go against all logic, because I know deep down that 26 is a great age! Like, there’s nothing inherently scary about turning 26 or 36 or 96, but for some reason I feel all this shame about where I am in life right now. 
 

 I feel like I haven’t accomplished enough, I feel insecure about my social life, I feel bad for still living in my childhood home….I keep telling myself that there’s no time limit for achieving goals, that I have the power to change my social life if I want, and that it’s financially smart for me to still be living at home. But still. My birthday puts all of this under a microscope for me, and I worry that other people are judging me for where I am at this point in my life. 
 

 I know 26 year olds who are married, who own homes, who are making 6 figures…I’m doing alright for myself but can’t help but feel like I’m falling woefully behind for someone who is halfway through their 20s. Anyone relate or have advice?!"
"Greetings
 

 29M here. After countless doctor visits and blood tests in the last 10 years, I am getting tired of what's wrong with me. In the past I have been treated for mild depression and sub-clinical hypothyroidism. For the depression I used at least 3 different medications, including citalopram, venlafaxine and vortioxetine. For the hypothyroidism I have had several on-off seasons of levothyroxin. Currently I have been on 25mcg of levothyroxin for 2 weeks. On summer of 2021 I was also being screened for ADHD diagnosis and I am not even sure if I ever got it. At least I don't have a paper that says so... But I was prescribed meds, Concerta and Elvanse (same as Vyvanse). First they worked and I was living the life of my dreams for like 2 weeks but then it all fell apart and I had severe anxiety for weeks. I had to call it off.
 

 My blood work has always been fine and doctors have been assuring me that there is nothing wrong with me. Or at least nothing ""serious"". Since 2020 I have been in the ER about 5-6 times for different reasons.
 

 For instance: I had a throbbing pain in my chest which radiated to my back, I was sure it was a heart attack but my vitals and ECG were just fine and I was dismissed with a ""jammed nerve"" or something.
 

 I also developed thyreotoxicosis once which led to severe anxiety attacks and heart palpitations. My TSH levels were down to less than 0.1 units. My thyroxine dose was only 39mcg/day.
 

 Once I went there because I was feeling really short of breath. I really had to use every muscle in my upper body to catch air. I was again examined by a doctor thoroughly and nothing was found. The doctor said that it's probably tight muscles around the body or anxiety about something.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 So since 2020 there has been symptoms almost every day. **Jitteriness, difficulties concentrating, really often cold hands and feet, difficulties falling and staying asleep, nervousness (pacing), heart sensations (pounding) and muscle tightness (in upper-mid back and neck). I am a musician and when I perform, at first I tend to get so nervous that I shake all over, especially my legs (and I really love performing).** Sometimes I would lose my appetite totally.
 

 I was also seriously addicted to online video gaming. I am pretty sure that it has something to do with the situation. Gaming would keep my mind at ease because I wasn't necessarily confronting myself and my feelings directly too often. So about a month ago, I decided to quit gaming.
 

 Feels like a hell was let loose. I have been a wreck after that, even though I know that my life should be better in the near future. My dopamine system is in pieces now though. There is also the fact that I have to confront every single moment of my awake-life at the moment.
 

 Since July 2022 new symptoms have risen: I had the worst case of dyspepsia, which felt like my stomach contents wouldn't move at all and caused me to lose all of my appetite and I felt nauseous 24/7. This was relieved by a PPI but the loss of appetite has been bothering me ever since. Also, I have not been able to FREAKING RELAX in such a long time that I don't even remember what it feels like. I have a doctors appointment about this in a couple of days.
 

 This anxious life has been a part of me for so many days now that I might not even be sure what is causing it anymore. I have my doubts though:
 

 My dream was to either have a career in the army or to get to med school. I was ""not fit"" for army so med school was my go-to try. I failed the exams 4-times, studying for 6 months at a time and leaving everything else in my life to have time and motivation to study. I got my first bout of depression after those exams and my first panic attacks also. I will make it to med school one day though!
 

 So, I am really into medical stuff. This makes me really aware of my health and thus I probably have more knowledge about health than a ""regular"" person and it gives me **hypocondric traits.** I am not essentially a hypocondriac (though I was proposing it to my doctor last time) but I really have some of the symptoms. Now that I am having all of these signs of different illnesses, I am googling 8 hours a day just to find explanation or solutions to my problems. And when I see something about cancers or something of the sort, I get severe anxiety. EDIT: I also have a bad case of emetophobia which gives me a hard time especially with my stomach symptoms that linger on and off.
 

 On top of it all, I have been studying computer science for 8 years. Early on I noticed that it would be a temporary path and I was a really bad student - that's why I don't even have a bachelor's yet. What I have is a 10k+ studying loan and my degree time is constantly running out. If I quit studying, I have to pay the loans back and I am not fit for work in my current condition. Lately I have been trying to get the studies underway since I managed to quit video games. The studies are something that I recognize as probably the biggest factor in my well-(or bad!)being. So far medical professionals have been reluctant to even examine me for anxiety. EDIT: Graduating is not far anymore but consider this: I really don't enjoy studying this subject and I have zero plans what so ever to ever work in this industry. I am studying because it feels that I am forced to.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 This week I am going to tell my doctor to run some tests on me because I am getting tired of feeling like a metal wire that's being extended by pulling it from both ends simultaneously. I am sure that I forgot something but I was hoping that the community here could help me out in some ways to let me know if there is something useful that I could tell the doctors to convince them to investigate it further or just in general: am I even fit for diagnosis in your opinion? Sorry for a semi messy post but I needed this... Thank you in advance!"
I’ve been thru so many dramatic events in my life and I’ve been that nice and understanding to the point where I didn’t know whether to be happy in my situation or not. Like we’ve both done of fair share of horrible things but idk if to wanna continue to hurt anymore because I lost a lot of people along the way and sometimes I feel like it’s not for the better.. I’m not stuck whether should I continue to feel at my low because of this or just try and work on myself to be better.
"Hi!!
 I drank Yerba mate today and I haven’t had caffeine in a long long time. I love coffee, I’ve been a coffee addict for years, but since last year, I had to cut back due to anxiety and panic attacks.
 

 Today, I decided to try Yerba mate to help with caffeine as an alternative to coffee.
 

 I didn’t know mate had as much caffeine as coffee.
 

 I consumed about 450ML and around 70G of Yerba mate.
 

 I’m super jittery, I have been shaky for like 5-6 hours. It is getting better but it hasn’t completely worn off.
 

 I’ve had a couple of anxiety attacks in the past hours and I don’t feel great. My HR is elevated around 89-105 and my O2 varies between 95-97
 

 Help!! Am I going to be ok?? 
 I’m scared I did too much!"

Hi all just got out of my appointment i could vent so much how shit the system is but i wont. I went a month ago and he said he thinks im on the spectrum as my anxiety is not getting better after treatment and meds. So i had a appointment today and i thought i would fight my case and he brought it up again and i said you cant throw a label at me i have spent 10 years trying to deal with my anxiety and you just throw this. I also am shit scared of relationships the thought of it makes me panic. He said thats a sign. Anyways I'm 29 manager of a supermarket now but feel depressed anxiety is bad again just moved up to 225mg effexor (again) 25mg quitiapine. My childhood was shit step dad was scitzo moved schools about 6 times etc. Then i moved and got my first full time job at 16 also got into a relationship then i got depressed a few months later tried to kill myself woke up the next day with panic attacks. I have had cbt. Emdr. Etc i just feel so broken. Slowly lost my friends over the years. I dont know its nice to vent.
"I feel proud to say that after starting medication and having a tough couple of years, I can finally leave this sub as I’m feeling happier than I have in a very long time. 
 

 My absolute biggest hugs to everyone here struggling. My advice is to find a few close people for support, go to that therapy session, try your best to be outside even a little bit a day, and be kind to yourself. You’re never going backwards, you’re always growing even on the worst days and I know you’ve got this 🙏. 
 

 Always available to chat if you need ❤️."
"I’m so depressed and suicidal i am stuck in a time warp my ex dumped me a month ago and said “I already moved on a long time ago, I just stayed because you couldn’t live without me”
 

 My ex was always working late, then going out to drink with coworkers or clubbing til 2-3am. If he had a night off, he went out drinking. I was always anxious and on edge on weekend nights, especially when I barely got to see him on the weekends. I was worried about where he was and if he was lying to me (he had lied to me multiple times during the relationship). I couldn't sleep, I felt so anxious. Most of my weekends involved crying at night or worrying what was going to happen next or what event I had to process next. One night in June, he created an argument, then stopped responding to me and I went to his house later that night and caught him dressed in his best clothes to go out to the nightclubs with his cheater / single friends. He was soooo angry at me like he'd been caught. He hurt me so badly and refused to ever talk with me about my feelings. When I brought up how I felt, he exploded on me. I dumped out his alcohol in the sink and he exploded ""THAT'S THE MOST DISRESPECTFUL THING YOU'VE EVER DONE TO ME, I'M GOING OUT, WE'RE DONE HERE LEAVE NOW."" I was balling my eyes out. His friends were going to a club with a cover charge with pole dancers and bottle girls. He always said I ruined his social life and didn't want him to have fun, when he wanted to act single.
 

 Another night in June, he went out drinking alone with his 27F female coworker bartender at 1:30am. He claims he was just getting a ride and she asked him to get drinks. He hid it from me at first and I had to pry the information out of him. I was so upset. He said ""I could've easily lied to you and hid it, next time I won't tell you."" He picked up the phone with her in the car… And she was silent. He said “I’m with Sam.” He ignored me for over an hour when they hung out, and acted like I was nagging him when I was crying on the phone. This happened more than once too. I was always anxious at night after that.
 

 He took my virginity after threatening to leave if we didn’t have sex and then when we did in April he said “whatever, you’re not really a virgin” and left for his soccer game. i was balling my eyes out and he screamed at me and got angry. he screamed “WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY??” 
 

 Another night earlier on in the relationship, he went bar hopping with his friends and they landed in a girls hotel room. One of the friends ended up hooking up with one of the girls in the room (and that's just to my knowledge). My Nex got blackout drunk and couldn't make it to the uber, apparently he collapsed and was dropped off at the emergency room and kept til 8am the next morning. He ignored me all the next day and I had to find out through mutual friends what happened. He tried to hide the information from me. I was so upset. When I asked him to show the hospital papers, he acted like he couldn't care less and hesitated to produce them.
 

 He would treat me this way and then blame me for not trusting him. He used to say, ""You don't trust me, it's damaging"" but act like he was single inside the relationship.
 

 I feel like a loser. He would invite me out late after work (midnight - 3am) and I never wanted to be out that late. But it was nice to have the invite. Now that he dumped me, weekend nights are the hardest with rumination and feelings of worthlessness. His life moved very fast and he was always doing something. It's hard to imagine the girl(s) he is with now, clubbing late, drinking and smoking, hanging with people he kept secret. Just knowing he's going out clubbing / partying tonight with a girl is making me upset and feel left out and awful since I'm a wreck, and can barely get out of bed or eat.
 

 it's been 30 days since I last saw him. I’m so depressed and anxious i can’t leave my house. painful flashbacks and dreams that wake me
 up crying. no job. can’t eat. It doesn’t hurt any less. When he dumped me he said “I was over you a long time ago, I just felt bad you couldn’t live without me” and “You make men feel trapped. No man will want to stay with you” “I want a relationship that takes up less time I want to live my 20’s”. He’s working with a record label and makes music and is related to a famous musician,
 he has it made.  
 

 He wanted me to dump him for months but I was in love with him. Now he’s out living his best life and i’m unable to get out of bed. i’ve reached out to over 80 therapists and MD’s seeking help and the best i could get is appt Jan 2023
 

 I’m 22F and he’s 22M"
"i don’t know what it is, but my roommate won’t stop making underhand and sly comments about me being autistic when i’m not. obviously there isn’t anything wrong with that, but it’s frustrating to be coddled when i don’t need to be as a grown (29f) woman. 
 

 i know, since i’ve been going to therapy for social anxiety/AvDP since i was 16, that my social skills are shit because i actively disengage from people and fear having relationships (friendship, platonic, or romantic). and, yknow i’ve had multiple doctors over the years test me just in case and i have come back negative for every assessment for autism. 
 

 i should say something, but confrontation is a huge trigger for me (regardless of what it’s about i instantly fall into shaky/panic attack mode) and for a while i just didn’t acknowledge it cause it just didn’t seem worth it. and i didn’t even want the need to FEEL like i need to defend myself cause if i was why would that matter to him so much?? how and why does that change anything about how he should interact with me (and it does) but now its at a point where it feels like he’s goading me to just announce it. like me being autistic is some big open secrets when it’s his own fantasy he wants to make reality to solve all his issues about me (a.k.a why i’m not social/don’t always constantly want to hang out with him) 
 

 this isn’t looking for advice, more just a frustrated rant in a space i know he or his friends won’t find."
"I've (25f) been scared of being dropped/abandoned since forever because of my experiences.
 

 I once flew out halfway across the country to visit my partners (polyamory) and was broken up with on the first day of what was supposed to be a 7 day trip, and left to fend for myself in an unfamiliar state alone. Later on, I was deprioritized, ignored, and eventually cheated on by a partner because I was having emotional issues approaching sex. I was trapped in a long-term emotionally abusive relationship with a man who would berate me for my fears of abandonment and would yell at me for needing regular reassurance of my worth and value. 
 

 I have regular issues considering myself to be a person someone wants to get to know, much less love or regularly spend time with, I fall into states of mind where I cannot believe that the people who claim to want me around are telling me the truth when they tell me, regardless of how they demonstrate it.
 

 These are things that I've only been working on healing for ~7 months since my previous breakup (cheater) and the second most previous (5 year emotional abuse). I have not had the ability to go to a therapist, although I am pursuing it currently, and right now I have a good social support group of friends, and a wonderful partner, but these are still things I grapple with on a weekly basis and cause me to break down and cry, seek out a lot of reassurance, have paranoid episodes, etc.
 

 Enter my friend (who I'm calling L), the person who introduced me to this current friend group of wonderful people. I get along with her famously, we always have a blast when we hang out, we've got lots in common and we make each other laugh ecstatically. We've been seeing each other once every week or two for months and texting back and forth regularly since we met. we've approached the subject of doing something more along the lines of fwbs, but we haven't done anything yet because she says she wants to take it extra slow because she doesn't want to mess it up by going too fast. Safe to say even though I have not known her long that I consider her to be a pretty close friend.
 

 Recently (very recently) I've confronted that I have feelings for her, I felt something for her since we first met, but I wanted to be extra sure that what I was feeling was real instead of puppy love that I've historically fallen into, and it is real. I've also learned since realizing this, after talking with her about certain intricacies of interfacing with her, that she is not looking for a relationship currently, and not super fond of the structure of a relationship period. She values her independence from anyone else's will and wants no obligation to perform.
 

 With his information in mind, she is also incredibly socially overdrawn. She already has a social schedule that is incredibly packed full from a full time job, several hobbies, and a full social schedule (1-on-1s, larger group settings, other social calls). The only thing that she doesn't regularly include is regular recharge time for herself, a point that I worry about. 
 

 My fear is this: even though she has so much on her plate already, she is still seeing new people &amp; making new connections; and I am terrified that my friendship will be dropped in favor of someone else. I cannot find a good way to believe that she will continue to make time for me in her life, and I am afraid that someone else will climb the ladder of emotional intimacy quicker than me and that she will spend time with me less and less.
 

 Truthfully I do want a relationship with her when I am more ready for it, but if I do I want it to be on her terms and respectful to her independance, which I respect deeply. Ideally, I just want a best friend that I can tell ""I love you"" to, anything else doesn't need labeling, I just want to feel special or valued slightly above the average friend to her, the rest is noise.
 

 How can I believe that she will continue to make time for me?
 

 How can I know that she won't deprioritize me in favor of someone else?
 

 What do I do to rationalize my emotions for her and my fear of abandonment?
 

 How can I trust that what she tells me about how she values me is true?"
Are you afraid of banter? I’m not talking about roasting each other just light banter. How does the idea of being put in the spot affect you?
"Hello everyone, ive been smoking weed for 8 years now, I started when I was 17 and now I'm 25. These past 2 weeks ive been feeling very very anxious when I smoke weed or a cigarette. It feels like my chest is so tight and my heart starts beating fast. I do cardio a bit as well and I only workout sober. So idk if its my health, or just my mental health. I've never really experience this until now and Im getting worried itll get worse. Obviously the best answer is to quit, but as you can see Im addicted to this shit. Im pretty sure people have experience this feeling too. If so, can you pls give me your best advice?"
"I have always had anxiety and anxiety around friendships is especially prevalent. I (25F) have recently gotten my life together. Went back to school, got a certificate from it, gotten a job. I started a month ago and really things have been looking up, or so I thought. You see I'd gotten close to this group and collectively we would go out for lunch near everyday, went out for drinks and the like. After I got a job that slowed down. I meet one friend most Sundays and I only really text another. Which is fine. There was five of us (including me) in total and the others are job hunting so we're all busy. But today I happened to check LinkedIn and while on there I wanted to see how their searches were going. I quickly discovered one of my 'friends' dis-connected with me.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 I don't know how to feel. I always felt on the edge of the group but I allowed myself to convince myself that was anxiety talking and self-sabotage but I don't think it was. It makes it worse that one day I got drunk with them and confessed that I didn't want to lose them, tears and all. I think guilt is keeping two of them in contact with me but if I ask them they are going to deny it. The one is see Sundays didn't really even invite me. He just made mention to me that most weekends he frequents this coffee shop and I should try it sometime.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 After all of this I just want to stay home and stop meeting up with them. I work from home, my family lives 2 hours away and now have no friends."
"Sometimes I get really weird sensations hard to describe but it's like sometimes the floor feels like it's moving up and down beneath my feet. 
 

 When I have a really bad episode my legs suddenly feel really heavy and slow and then my heart will race. 
 

 I think it's called pre syncope not sure though. 
 

 Had my heart checked out and all is well so not sure what to do to help it? 
 

 Anyone else get this and have advice on what helped? 
 

 I'm trying to exercise more but almost seems like the day after I get more of these sensations when I've exercised."
"As the title suggests I have been noticing an improvement in working memory but I'm having a terrible time with recalling memories of any sort. I don't expect to be able to remember names much easier (I suppose I just don't care so much), but If I'm explaining something or telling a story to someone from memory I have pauses and lapses. Its as if my brain gets stuck or something. I assumed it was anxiety but even when I feel very calm it happens a lot (I will be mid-sentence and not be able to recall many details and or the rest )"
"I have heard here that many people have found that Propranolol has been very helpful to them when it comes to treating anxiety. 
  
 I have taken up to 40mg of Propranolol in one sitting and up to 60mg a day but it has not eased my anxiety at all. I also noticed that it stops working after a very short period of time so I should be taking it multiple times a day. 
  
 Is my dosage off or is it just not working for me?"
Or does it make that fear much worse?
"Me (28M)Two days ago at around 12 am I was chilling watching TV and drinking a cup of coffee when all of the sudden my mouth went dry and everything felt weird. Like if nothing was real. Note that before this (like 3 days before) I’ve been feeling a rather discomfort feeling on my left side of my chest and arm. So the day I was watching TV and I went straight to my mom and told her I wasn’t feeling at all good, I never complain about anything like that. I guess something triggered my Anxiety/Panic attack because my heart started racing like it would pop out my chest and I felt like I was gonna faint or something. I had never had anything like that in my life so I got really scare. I had to go to the ER because something was not right with me, so we did. Once in the ER I was giving something to sleep for an hour because Apparently I had a small heart attack from too much coffee. Once I woke up I really started to feel worst that before and I started feel nauseous and all of the sudden my body stated shaking uncontrollably I couldn’t even move I just sat there and I was giving something stronger to sedate my body and muscles. I couldn’t even talk cuz my jaw was close shot. I need help because I still don’t feel my self again, I feel like the panic attack is coming back out of nowhere and I start to get scare again so I just start doing breathing Exercises but still I feel off all foggy and I just want to nap. Honestly I don’t know what to do to feel better or to feel like my self again even just by going to the store just the thought of having one on public scares me and I start to feel anxious and I just hurry home before something happens. Next week I going to have a heart check up and later I’m planning to go to therapy to see why I’m getting small panic attacks all of the sudden when I have never had one in my life."
"I've been having some pretty crappy morning anxiety almost every morning for the last few weeks. I have an extensive history with anxiety/panic, and trauma around emotional abuse in past relationships as well as bad experiences in the past with marijuana and LSD. Before experiencing these difficult situations, I still had anxiety in some ways here and there but it never got in the way of me living my life. I was always spontaneous, always outside doing something, always socializing and finding fun, creative things to do alone and with others. Now, I tend to go through cycles of agoraphobia due to panic attacks which makes it really difficult to go out and do literally anything with anybody. I feel like my path to freedom in terms of that is this giant mountain that I have to scale, but I'm constantly too mentally exhausted to be able to do it or make significant progress. Over the last 4 or so years, I've experienced these cycles of derealization as well which also make it really difficult to actually process traumas or make progress towards healing. This happened for the first time after getting out of a really emotionally abusive relationship with someone that I was really attached to. At first I had really bad health anxiety about derealization because I thought I was completely losing my mind and slipping into psychosis or something like that. But after learning what it was and how common that symptom is when it comes to anxiety, it provided relief but is still difficult nonetheless. Thankfully, my ability to reality check has always been in tact and my therapists over the years have told me that I pretty much have the complete opposite of psychosis; that I'm TOO self aware lol. Today, I'm just feeling extra overwhelmed. I feel like I'm losing sight of what my life is at all. I basically wake up with a pit in my stomach and my morning anxiety manifests as dry heaving until I can manage to eat something sufficient. I live alone in NYC and find myself missing my family a lot (who all live in Florida), but the idea of traveling is really stressful at the moment. For most of the day, I feel completely aimless and alone despite having a wonderfully supportive partner and it makes the anxiety a lot worse. I'm currently in between jobs due to being part of a mass layoff a few months ago and it's been stressful finding a new position. I'm just really overwhelmed and tired of waking up every day having to fight off this giant monster that is anxiety day after day. I'm 29 years old and I currently don't take any medication for it aside from a very small dose of klonopin if the day is especially crappy and I feel too exhausted to face it head on.

 I'm sure many of you have experienced this to one degree or another. Do you have any advice? words of encouragement? Thanks y'all."
"Me (28M)Two days ago at around 12 am I was chilling watching TV and drinking a cup of coffee when all of the sudden my mouth went dry and everything felt weird. Like if nothing was real. Note that before this (like 3 days before) I’ve been feeling a rather discomfort feeling on my left side of my chest and arm. So the day I was watching TV and I went straight to my mom and told her I wasn’t feeling at all good, I never complain about anything like that. I guess something triggered my Anxiety/Panic attack because my heart started racing like it would pop out my chest and I felt like I was gonna faint or something. I had never had anything like that in my life so I got really scare. I had to go to the ER because something was not right with me, so we did. Once in the ER I was giving something to sleep for an hour because Apparently I had a small heart attack from too much coffee. Once I woke up I really started to feel worst that before and I started feel nauseous and all of the sudden my body stated shaking uncontrollably I couldn’t even move I just sat there and I was giving something stronger to sedate my body and muscles. I couldn’t even talk cuz my jaw was close shot. I need help because I still don’t feel my self again, I feel like the panic attack is coming back out of nowhere and I start to get scare again so I just start doing breathing Exercises but still I feel off all foggy and I just want to nap. Honestly I don’t know what to do to feel better or to feel like my self again even just by going to the store just the thought of having one on public scares me and I start to feel anxious and I just hurry home before something happens. Next week I going to have a heart check up and later I’m planning to go to therapy to see why I’m getting small panic attacks all of the sudden when I have never had one in my life."
"Hey everyone, 
 

 That's me posting here for the first time. I've had a terrible morning. My company had planned a team building event today and I felt nervous the whole week. My feeling told me to take the day off or to even call in sick. But somehow I thought I should give it a go as I feel very often like an outsider in the company and that people think I'm very akward and stupid. I have to mention at this point that the company I work for has a strong social culture with a lot of events, meetings etc. going on. Which I guess it's great, but it's a nightmare for someone with social anxiety. I also feel like I'm the only one there that's introvert and social anxious. Anyways, today was this company event. I even took a bit of propranolol to calm me down which worked at the beginning. But then we split into different groups of 6 people (that were randomly decided) and we were supposed to start our first task. We had to build some pieces of wood togehter. The task was asking for logically thinking and the time was running up in the background. Honestly, I don't even know how to describe what we we were doing but it was pure pressure and stress for me. Everyone in the group came up with ideas and it was all very fast moving. Meanwhile one of our managers of the company was standing behind me taking notes on how we are interacting with each other. I was just standing there like an idiot watching the others trying to solve this task. My collueges tried to tell me what I should do and I messed everything up by not being able to process. I'm also not native English and just moved to the country which makes fast conversations still difficult for me. I could tell how annoyed some of my collueges were. I couldn't stop thinking that I'm being judged and hated. And than also that time pressure going on. I was so overwhelmed and I knew I can't hold back my tears. I started to cry in front of everyone and said that I was sorry and that I feel very anxious. One of the woman gave me a hug but told me to stop crying and said I should never show my weakness, which made me feel even worse for crying. But I knew it came from a good place, it just made me feel worse. The manager was calling for the HR woman which brought me outside to talk. We decided it's better for me to leave. So I went back in (still shaking and covered in tears) said goodbye to the group and now I'm on my way back home. I can't describe how embarrassing this whole situation was and how worthless I feel right now. I'm 26 and I feel like a little child. I'm supposed to go on Holiday tonight, but it makes me feel so bad. I won't be able to enjoy the time as I'm overthinking what just happened. It know it also will be terrible to go back to work after a week of ""hiding"". At this point I feel like quitting my job and never show up again. 
 Sorry for the long text - it helped me to process everything and to believe I'm not the only one that goes through these situations. 
 Thanks if you were reading so far, I know my English is not the best right now."
"For some quick background I'm a f27 and I've had anxiety since I was 7 and depression since I was 11. I've experienced it all. Minor anxieties of jitters and nervousness to severe ""put in a hospital, mental break down anxiety."" Depression has always been the ugly partner to the anxiety.
 

 Over the years to battle my anxiety and depression I've done tons of therapy, tried medication, diet change, meditation, yoga, working out, breathing exercises, ect.
 

 But it's different now. I had my daughter 3 years ago and had PPD, PPA, and paranoia. I thought that it couldn't get worse until one year after her birth I experienced an anxiety attack that I literally thought was a heart attack. My chest got tight and it felt like my heart stopped. Then there was so much pain and started hurting all the way down into my left arm. Hyperventilating like crazy and went to the ER just to be told I was fine. I experienced those panic attacks for a little over a month until I went numb.
 

 My chest has been hurting off and again since that day for two years and yesterday I experienced the same panic attack and thought I was dying. My chest spasmed heart rate spiked to 150, pain shooting through my chest and arm. I'm panicking because I can't go through this again and I feel like I'm going crazy and all my coping mechanisms are basically useless because of the physical pain and any sense of logical thinking is gone.
 

 I've had anxiety for so long and I've learned how to cope with it but this is an entirely different monster and I'm slipping into this dark place and I feel so alone. 
 

 I have a very scientific based mind set and do everything I can to get to a logical explanation (possible a coping mechanism to the years of anxiety). I have gone into the doctors and they told me the pain was inflammation of my cartilage. I've also heavily researched precordial catch syndrome (not diagnosed). 
 

 I know I have a lot of emotional trauma and wonder if there is anyone else out there that has experienced this and maybe I'm holding all of my emotional damage in my body. I just need to know I'm not alone. (I will note that both anxiety attacks happened when I was driving. I'm not sure if that has any correlation)"
"Anxiety, you stupid bitch you, have been nothing but destructive in my life since I was young. Destroying moments, my health, my sanity. I just want to say to you, fuck you! Fuck you for affecting me and my life so much! Fuck you for making waking up a chore! Fuck you for making me think that the end of the world is here, or for making me fear things far away in the future. And most of absolute all, Fuck you for hurting me and the ones I love! May there be one day where you are nothing but a nasty memory in the past, and may there be a day that everyone who suffers can get up and dump your ass to the street where you belong. Fuck you, and every single horrible symptom of yours!"
"28M here; been on Paxil since 2017. I've been suffering social and generalized anxiety since I was 16. At age 22, after trying Mirtazapine with little results other than improved sleep, I was put on Paxil 20mg (paroxetine) and it changed my life. Anxiety levels decreased rapidly and I became almost ""normal"" in that I could function like a normal person (date people, work in public, etc...).
 

 The bad thing is I feel so sleepy and tired. I don't feel weak and my bloods are normal, but the drowsiness is quite unbearable at times, and I need lots of caffeine to keep me awake and productive. This ""couldn't care less"" attitude that paroxetine gives you is good to stop caring about silly things, but it also makes you feel lazy and I find it very difficult to exercise or do things on my free days. Also, my libido is pretty low.
 

 I've been thinking about things like Modafinil or Wellbutrin which could give me the boost I need. I've read that Modafinil is very good to keep you awake and concentrated on things, whereas Wellbutrin is better for libido issues, lack of energy and it also has the antidepressant properties.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 What do you think guys? I wanna go visit my doctor and talk this with him but I'd like to know if you have any experiences with meds that can improve these SSRI's adverse effects.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Thank you."
"I (25F) hope I’m not alone here, but I feel like people I know and even strangers can hear my thoughts, see what I’m doing and see life through my eyes. I especially feel this way about people who’ve died that I know. My brother died recently and I feel like he can see everything I see and what I’m doing. I don’t know whether it’s my brain trying to stay connected to him, but it happens all the time and normally at the weirdest times, like when I’m in the shower. It happens with my friends who’ve died too. 
 

 Has anyone ever felt like this and how do you deal with it? It really affects me a lot. I’m not sure if it’s an anxiety thing, a grief thing, an ADHD thing (have that too) or a mix of the two :/"
"I've been unemployed for a long time before finding this one, and for some time it was something that really helped me, improved my mental health, but now... now I feel terrible. I feel scared of my boss who is very demanding and very manipulative.
 

  I also work 2 minutes drive from home, but since I live in the countryside, it's a very tight knit community... but not in a positive way. I don't feel like I'm off work even when I am, and my boss tries to wipe the line between private life and work. I hate it. 
 

 Both she and my coworkers are very judgemental, gossipy and can be nasty, and it got worse recently. I'm so tired, I'm snappy, I started to feel anxious again, I can't eat, nothing makes me happy or relaxed anymore. I take Prozac daily and it doesn't help anymore! I don't want to take Xanax daily just so I can handle work, it's only for emergency. 
 

 I decided to quit only after I talked to my dad and his partner, who both told me they'll support me in everything I do, and to leave that job - they don't have the best opinion about this place anyway. 
 

 I applied to a few different places, I planned emergency side jobs, I can help my sister at her farm to earn a bit too - but I'm still so anxious. 
 

 I can't stop thinking I'm a burden. I can't stop thinking that maybe I'm too demanding, or I'm too weak, that maybe it'd be better for everyone that I just force myself to work there. That I have to take care of myself on my own, with no help from anyone else. But when I think about staying there, I feel so terrified, I'm thinking about commiting suicide just to avoid that place. 
 

 But then it made me think - if I'm ready to commit suicide to leave that job, why not just straight up leave it?
 

 But I'm still so fckng anxious! I'll have to work there for a month after I terminate the contract, I'm sure they won't be nice to me, and starting another job feels like such a challenge - but it's less scary than staying here. 
 

 I'm just... people change jobs! Why do I feel so scared? Why am I still so anxious? Why am I feeling like a burden to my family who told me they have my back? Am I making a mistake? Will that feeling follow me to my new job? 
 

 I'm mostly venting but I also look for... idk, reassurance? Someone to tell me it's normal to be scared while changing jobs? That it's not the end of the world?"
"I know anxiety and stress can be REALLY hard on the stomach/guts in general. But does anyone else wake up already feeling like a tight stomach? Or with some sort of a pressure feeling? Upper stomach, mostly."
"Hey guys, I needed somewhere to get this off my chest. I (25F) have been struggling with anxiety for over four years now and it has only gotten worse…This year has especially been hard, but I am trying my best to manage it (I was in therapy for over a year; diagnosed with GAD). I do not have any friends, but I do have a caring and loving boyfriend. Last night, I went out with him and his friends and well as usual I felt very much like an outsider looking in. I feel this on a regular basis, but particularly when I’m surrounded by a group of people who have things in common but I don’t. I mostly just heard their stories of when they were back in high school. I always have felt a bit of an outsider and growing up I had few but solid friendships that dissolved over the years. I never had a group of friends and I guess hearing their stories made me more sad because I never got to experience that. I kept thinking I would rather be home and wanted nothing to do with them or my boyfriend. I slowly realized I was the problem. I complain about not having friends but then I do not make an effort to make friends. I am holding myself back. I thought this moment of clarity would be enough, but I just feel hopeless. I want to distance myself from everyone again. Damn it. I really thought I was making progress with this anxiety. I hate how transparent I can be and I try to hide it from my boyfriend but he sees my face and he knows I’m not okay. I know this all sounds really terrible and ungrateful, but I can’t help these feelings and every rebuttal I have against them I get another reason to distance myself. I’m not happy around his friends mostly I just feel left out because most of what they talk about is the past so I just listen since I can’t relate. I really don’t want to go out with them again but I know I can’t do that to my boyfriend but I also don’t know how to hide these feelings. The more I stuff them down, the more they bubble up. I tried talking to my boyfriend about it in the past but he doesn’t understand and just feels guilty. I know I’m the problem but that knowledge isn’t enough for change. :( I am trying though. I just hate feeling like an outsider especially when I am around people but I really wish I had a friend of my own separate from my bf. I don’t really have anyone to talk to, perks of being anxious and an over thinker. 
 

 

 Long story short, I complain I’m lonely but continuously distance myself."
"I’m getting married next April, and I think subconsciously this is taking a giant toll on my anxiety. My anxiety has been at some of its worse over the past several weeks. It seems untriggered at times. I was switched from Prozac to Pristiq about 5-6 weeks ago and it has seemed to help my anxiety a little bit but not much. Does anyone have any advice on how to relax about wedding planning? Or am I doomed for the next few months with my anxiety? 
 

 For what it’s worth, I have been diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder."
"TL;DR
 (27f) Recently got diagnosed with GAD and ADHD, taking Vyvanse, which is making my rumination cycle worse.
 

 I'm really stuck in a great dilemma currently which is greatly increasing my anxiety levels. I have an exam coming up in the near future. I scheduled it for the last week of October, but ended up wasting the last 3-4 months due to increased anxiety, where I would be dysfunctional and crying incessantly the entire day, instead of studying. It was due to my husband's sister who began sort of bullying me very randomly and it went on for a couple weeks (via text messages). I haven't been able to get her words out of my brain even now. They were all just remarks on my employment status, body shaming me and some other weird remarks(absolutely nonsensical, more of her own insecurities). But I haven't been able to stop ruminating about all of this even after I deleted her contact and stopped all forms of communication
 My worst dilemma is that, I am expected to fly timezones for her wedding which is exactly a month before my exams. I'm in the worst situation ever, I've already had to postpone my exam to January because of my Anxiety resulting from all of this and no one is ready to understand the fact that I cannot make it for the wedding. I'm pretty sure that I will be wasting more time after this, ruining my mental health even further (I'm sure they will say more things to ruin my exams and my mental health). And my husband is not ready to understand that I don't want to fly a month before my exams. I have no idea what to do."
"Idk why I tolerate so much wrong like I did things for people that didn’t even deserve it.. like I even did things for people that ended up hurting me at the end.. and I think to myself why did I do this to myself.. like I didn’t even deserve the majority of it.. 
 

 Just an reflection and needing an way to cope with it.."
"I can't even bring myself to get excited. A part of me just wants it over and idk why. We're going on a cruise which is something I've never done before.. maybe that's why. I mean, I'm generally unhappy in my everyday life anyway so I'm not surprised I can't seem to enjoy anything."
"If you are too, I send you a big hug. It's the least we can do in a sub like this, try to support each other."
"I (M25) have suffered from anxiety, panic attacks since forever, and I whenever I go through periods of anxiety and panics attacks I always plan to get back to working out and eating healthy but as soon as I’m not anxious I eat horrible and go out partying and give myself anxiety like I’m on a never ending loop."
"As someone who has gotten over social anxiety, I’ve realized that many peoples issues associated with social anxiety is the desire for approval. This is the result of the concept of “not knowing what to say” (and low self esteem).The reality is, there isn’t a perfect way to articulate, the goal of a nonchalant conversation is to establish/build a connection.
 

 Connections aren’t built by one party saying what the other wants to hear, it’s built by the mutual desire to understand each other. If, for example, you are having a conversation with one individual whom you’ve just met, what do you need to do to build a connection? I think many people here believe that they must say something that will click with the other person. Wrong.
 

 You cannot read peoples minds and people can sense your desire to force a connection and thus, will get a sense that you’re being inauthentic. You have to give **your** opinions and stand by them. You have to share what **you** like and explain why. Why do you need to explain why? Because this establishes your beliefs, people can then infer on your personality and will be willing to learn more about you. 
 

 And yes, you have to give your opinions too. It might be scary, the idea that you have to share your opinions is frightening because it’s personal and you have a deep rooted fear of rejection, so the most painful kind of rejection is what’s closest to your heart, your convictions. But what if I told you that someone disagreeing or disliking your interests are a good thing? Do you think that relationships are built in agreement? No, a good relationship is built on tension, there needs to be friction, otherwise, it will be too linear and boring. 
 

 Disagreements heighten emotions and are the bonding agents in a relationship. Agreements and common interests are great, but you won’t get along with everyone you share similarities with, many people are friends with people whom they share practically no similarities with. You need to transform your mind into understanding, believing, and knowing that seeking validation is wrong."
"I feel like something that’s really holding me back from whole heartedly being kinder to myself and believe more kind and positive things about myself, like my therapist is trying to get me to (for a year now) is this fear that that’s not what I need, and that I actually need to be harder on myself, and try harder and change things about myself and also that somehow, if I can be aware of all my faults and flaws, and self-aware and a good person and I feel like the yardstick for whether or not I’m a good person is if I am appreciated and loved by others Then it will prove that I’m bringing something positive into the world or growing or maturing — if I could just forget about myself, and stop caring so much about myself and my own pain and be more humorous and lighthearted, I feel that would also be a sign that I was a good mature person who brought joy into the world.
 

 For example, if my mother asks me to make her bed and but then I do something wrong (like accidentally put the blanket on sideways) and my mother criticizes me for making her bed the wrong way, for example, and says that ""it's ridiculous"" that ""I don't know how to make a bed at 25"" and that I'm way behind my peers and incompetent in many other areas where I shouldn't be, should I take a hard look at myself and let myself feel the truth of her statement as a way to practice self-awareness and motivate myself to try harder and ""grow up"" or should I try to say that everyone makes mistakes and it's just a bed? What if I get overwhelmed by the tone of her voice and words when she is saying this, and I feel so upset but also ashamed that I'm so incompetent (or that my mother is so ""disgusted with me"" (whether or not she really is), that I start to cry as she is saying this? And what if as I am crying she asks me why I'm crying and gets frustrated/exasperated that I take everything she says so personally and can't take critique without crying or feeling hurt? Should I take this at face value and try very hard to be less sensitive to what she says and toughen up and try to grow from her criticism, and recognize the truth in it, and also the truth in what she is saying about my hypersensitivity as a sign of immaturity and something to work on or should I try to not internalize what she is saying (basically, does she have a point and how much of what she is saying should I internalize as true and good feedback)?
 

 Does any of this make sense? I know I overthink things but I really feel like if I don’t, I would be worse off, and thinking and ruminating is a way to restrain myself or correct myself or avoid doing something worse than just thinking. I’m really asking for honest opinions here not just validation so please please don’t hold back. What do you think? Should I do as my therapist suggest and try to be kinder to myself and acknowledge that I’m too hard on myself and also admit that others have hurt/are hurting me and I don’t have to internalize all their negative feedback—- OR is what I need truly have more to do with pushing myself and thinking about myself less, being more grateful, and being a little stricter and tougher on myself?"
"I’ve never posted before, but recently found a lot of people on reddit suffering similar symptoms and its the first time I’ve found anything I can relate too.
 

 I’m 29M and have been having a number of issues since I was 22. I feel constantly tired/fatigued, headaches, tired eyes. Feels like tension around eyes almost permanently. I have this constant kind of heavy feeling in my head that never really clears. Like you haven’t been to sleep. This is pretty much every day for 7 years.
 

 On top of this I don’t always feel comfortable standing still, feel unsteady and find myself tensing to keep stiff/stay up. Better once I’m moving though do feel off balance walking at times. Have had this weird sensation that feels like being in an elevator, like dropping for a split second then back to normal. Some of this has caused panic attacks but its all the other feelings I’m more bothered about. 
 

 Throughout this journey I have tried multiple antidepressants, had an mri on my head, ecg years ago. Doctors have always said anxiety but its hard to believe my head can feel like this every day because of anxiety.
 

 Feel like I’ve just pushed through it for all these years. I go to the gym regularly even with these feelings, I dont drink or smoke and was perfectly healthy till 22. 
 

 It seemed to coincide with a health scare, that turned out to be absolutely nothing but I stressed for a few weeks with little sleep however once I was told it was nothing I thought I would just get better however I was left with this.
 

 I probably have missed some things, but the point of the post was I want to know if anyone else feels similar to me? Has anyone got anything that made them better? Any suggestions to try? Is this all just “anxiety”?
 

 I just want to get better and actually enjoy life!"

"This is going to be a long one but I literally have not a single person to talk to so here it goes ....
 

 I'm a (25F) and I live with my parents I had my daughter a year and a half ago and my son in july and my life is absolute hell but heres why. 
 

 So from the beginning my parents are narcissists and for the longest time I had NO idea what that meant I simply took it as a word applied to parents that physically abused their kids and my parents weren't that long and behold just because they weren't putting there hands on me the mental and emotional abuse from them did ENOUGH. My mom is very caring when she wants to be and will give you the shirt off her back but the SECOND you don't listen to her or do what she wants its world war 87. She will fuss constantly tell you all the things shes done for you and that she never gets anything in return that tangent type of thing my parents have 2 other kids and not to toot my own horn or anything I've done SO much more for her then the both of them put together but I constantly get the rut of being told how much I basically messed up with having two kids so early YET she has raised my nephew from birth and hes now 12 while my sister runs the road on herion all day and his dad does cocaine but never hear ANYTHING for it. Now that I'm raising my kids basically alone I hear anything and everything for it and I'm a great mother I do everything I can but to her it isn't good enough and never will be. Now my dad isn't much for conversation I call him the ""puppet"" because my mother has him trained to do every little thing she says and he feels like as long as he is ""working"" he can talk to anyone how he wants but yet ""my"" food stamps provide the food ""my"" tax credit helped him with ""his"" taxes.
 

 Now heres the depression part now that I've explained my parents in a very small nutshell. I am now dating this guy (27M) he's had a TERRIBLE background meaning his mother and father did a terrible job raising him long story short he's seen a lot of shit he shouldn't have seen and encountered a bunch of things that he shouldnt. In the beginning of our relationship things were a little rocky but fine I got pregnant very early into the relationship and he was NOT okay with that my whole pregnancy was TERRIBLE with him he was very resentful and rude we broke up on and off several times and he just wouldn't come to the conclusion okay were having a baby step up and be a man granted he has a son in a different state that he left when he was about one for personal reasons he still keeps up with him everynow and then but thats besides the point this guy has literally put me through hell and back but I love him I couldn't even explain the things that he's said or done. He always had this rude side about him which I hate. Now We began dating September of last year I had my son july of this year shortly after his birth my boyfriend started to change his ways theres a part of me that feels theres a motive but then theres a part of me where I feel like he's genuinely trying to be better for us and my daughter (which isn't his by the way).
 

 Now him and my mom CLASH she HATES him and because I live with my parents it makes it very hard for me not to be stressed out hes limited when he can come here leading up to the one day he's allowed over here I have to hear a song and a dance about it. If why she doesn't like him ""he's using me"" ""I'm his way out of his grandparents house"" ""I'm a booty call"" all of these hurtful things. So this past weekend we got in a argument because she literally doesn't even want me talking on the phone to him now because she feels like he's listening to everything going on in her house granted before I couldn't open up to him because he would throw it all back in my face when we argued but he doesn't do that anymore. So when things bother me I tell him.
 

 So now back to him he's wanting us all to move out but honestly with 2 small kids I can't see myself doing that because I personally don't trust daycares and he isn't really familiar with how to be a dad like I said he left his son around 1yrs old so everything is dammn near new to him all over again and another big factor my daughter may be on the spectrumwe are seeing signs and no one really knows how to deal with that besides me and my mom and its like he doesn't get that. So we constantly argue because its like he's ready but he's trying to make me get a job so we can afford it and I can't do that. He constantly says things like he wants to marry me but we need to be out first and he wants to be here for me but he cant because were not out first.
 

 So its like I'm drawn between two people my mom that solely knows my daughter and how to help but also throws her weight around because I live here and at the end of the day its her way or no way. And my boyfriend that was a complete dick in the beginning of the relationship some days still a dick now but trying to change and wanting to move out.
 

 I just want advice on what to do I'm at a loss for words ideas. And I feel trapped and lonely I feel like I'm living a double live between them 2."
"Title. Here's a couple of examples:
 

 - I had a ruler in my bag which I wanted to use so I took it out and left it right beside me. I was taking out my book and laptop and was trying to find my ruler in my bag (which was already taken out) and I fully thought I left it at home within seconds of this happening. I was cursing to myself cuz i really needed the ruler but found it right beside me and was so relieved.
 

 - I would wear a jacket over my hoodie unzipped. I was waiting in line to get some coffee so I would pull out my phone and check something then put it back in my hoodie pocket. Mins later I want to use my phone so I'm checking my jacket pocket and my pants and cant find it, forgetting I'm also wearing a hoodie, and was about to leave the line to check my car but found it in my hoodie pocket.
 

 Things like these tend to happen alot and it is very disruptive. But these things happen when I'm out in public more often than not. At home it would be like not finding the eraser on the table mins after I just used it.
 

 Is there any way to fix this?"
"For the past few weeks I've been feeling worse and worse, and it stemmed from my toxic job environment I believe. 
 

 Today I took a medical leave until i can see my psychiatrist next week, and knowing I won't have to go there for a week... fuck, I feel so good when i realize it. Then the guilt hits me - you're a fraud, you feel better, you're just lazy - I try to take my mind off work and responsibilities and it makes me feel anxious too! 
 

 I'm anxious bc I don't worry! Bc I don't feel bad! Bc Im avoiding a thing that brings me pain and makes me want to harm myself! What can I do? I need someone to tell me it's okay to walk away, to put myself first, bc right now I feel like a failure"
"Hey guys, I just want to share my thoughts on building relationships since it was very hard for me to grasp this a year ago when I had pretty bad social anxiety (I have more to say on this post but it’s already longer than I thought). Making friends, I believe, is a concept. There isn’t a guide on how to do it because a relationship of such kind is quite complicated in the emotional sense, but very straightforward.
 

 ***What is friendship?***
 

 I really don’t know tbh, I don’t think most people think about it, we just like being with people we like, it fulfills our desire to socialize and feel accepted. The core of friendship is giving and receiving value. You must “give” something to someone else because time is valuable, it has to be worth it. What is this value? It can come in the form of relatable interests to talk about, common hobbies to share with, a cool place to hang out, etc. first you must understand that and from there, think about anything you can provide that would be interesting or worth spending time with.
 

 ***What if I don’t have any values?***
 

 That’s not true, you can provide something. Ultimately, you can’t just exist and expect people to like you, sometimes you won’t even understand why people want to connect with you, they just will. Spending time with people will build value, people place more importance on how the interactions make them feel as opposed to what exactly was done, that’s why dates don’t need to be extravagant for them to be good. 
 

 Think about your personality, your likes and dislikes, your hobbies, what exactly are you? You might say to yourself “I have SA so I’m not social, I’m not the planner, I’m not the comedian, I don’t have a place for people to hangout, I don’t have a personality, and I’m not passionate about anything.” If you keep telling yourself these things, it will be true. It’s all in your head, many people don’t even know you have SA so guess what? You’re not going to be judged for it. You have to let people understand you, if SA is so strong, you can actually use that to your advantage.
 

 ***What do you mean by that?***
 

 You can use the fact that you’re socially anxious as something quirky. Tell stories as a way for people to understand who you are and at the same time, get your sense of humour. You can relate a past embarrassing experience because they’re funny. It’s easy to pull one of those out and it doesn’t require being witty. 
 

 “There was a time where I wanted to text a friend if they’re watching the latest episode of x. I stared at my phone for 2 hours and by the time I formed my message, I taped my pillow to the wall, spent another hour trying to press send, and afterwards, threw my phone at the pillow. Unfortunately, I missed the pillow so there’s a dent on the wall and the corner of my phone cracked 🙈”
 

 It can be so benign and all you need to do is tell your story with some energy and people will be attracted to you. **energy** is important, without it, you provide no value. If you’re monotone, practice modulation, watch videos on how to do so. If articulating is hard, watch videos on how to practice articulating. You don’t need to be a social butterfly to make friends, I’m quite introverted and can do so. Make people feel who you are and they will eventually reciprocate."
"I've noticed over the last year or so, I'm having a really hard time speaking. Whether I'm giving a work presentation or just hanging out with friends and family, I lose my train of thought/forget words when I'm in the middle of a sentence.
 

 Other people try to help me by finishing the sentence for me, but it gets awkward when they don't say what I was actually thinking.
 

 Do you think this is anxiety/mental illness related? I'm 28. I feel like my brain shouldn't be slowing down so soon?"
"The inability to sleep, to eat, to enjoy life. Imagine, not being able to watch your favorite TV show or play your favorite game due to some stupid anxiety. Imagine not being able to eat anything but Jell-O, imagine having to fucking buy yourself BABY FOOD just to eat. Imagine not being able to just turn off your fucking head just to sleep. Everything is a trigger. You once lived a full life, a job, just content. But a single day, brings that all crashing down. Just wondering when everything will get back to the way it was. Everyone says it's inevitable I will get better, while I think it's only inevitable that I'll be anxious forever."
"I've always had this really intense difficulty having the confidence to tell people what I want to be called. Let's say my name is something along the lines of Jacklin. I've been 'Jacklin' my whole life and I've never really liked it. I don't hate my name, I don't want to change it -- for me it's a part of my identity, just not the part I want to be known by commonly. 
 

 Whenever the teacher called on me in school at the beginning of each grade and asked if I had a nickname I'd prefer, I would just sort of shrink back and assure them whatever they wanted to call me was fine. They always defaulted to my full name -- which I can understand and get behind -- but I was always disappointed.
 

 I felt like kids that were cool and endearing got nicknames to match, and I definitely wouldn't have categorized myself to that relevant standard. Even being Jackie or Jacks was beyond the confidence of my self-determined clout...
 

 Several years ago, I was given a nickname only a few people ever called me -- the equivalent of what 'Jake' is to 'Jacklin.' Similar enough but not really the same. I absolutely LOVE this nickname. 
 

 As time went on, I moved, my circle and job changed -- Jake was kind of dead in the water. I've gotten a little better from when I was a kid; I can now (recently) comfortably tell people I prefer Jackie to Jacklin, but when I mention Jake I can't really do so with the same confidence.
 

 I don't really feel like I have a fair claim to it, if that makes sense.
 

 I usually throw it out in the context of a joke and it doesn't get taken seriously. Like 'My name's Jacklin -- Jackie is fine or if you're feeling cool-a-rooni you can go for Jake.' Or 'Hey management hired another Jackie? That's cool, I'll be Jake instead.'
 

 Everyone thinks I'm joking (because it definitely sounds like I am) and I'm still not Jake. 
 

 Now I'm transferring to another location in another state and I see this as a chance to start over a bit and go by the nickname of my choosing -- I can literally change my preferred name in our company system and most shouldn't bat an eye or even know that I was ever NOT Jake. 
 

 The only thing is, I did reach out to management to initiate my transfer as 'Jackie' -- and if anyone in leadership asks me about the discrepancy I will go into an /immediate/ and incredibly awkward panic. I know the solution is as simple as saying 'Oh yeah, that's my name but I just prefer to go by Jake.'
 

 But it is so hard to even form that thought when I feel like I've overstepped by choosing my own cool kid nickname. I guess part of me still feels like I don't have the authority to be making a decision like that, that I'm getting called tf out and that nicknames are these magic sparkly things that are bestowed upon you by guys in sunglasses doing sic tricks on their computerized teslaboards at the mall or something. See? I don't know, man. It just overwhelms me and I freak right out. 
 

 This is something I've had a hard time with for as long as I can remember. Before grade school (I'm 27 now). 
 

 Anyway thanks for your time, internet stranger(s). Any advice or words of encouragement would be friggin sweet, but I'm also happy to commiserate with my fellow (notquite)Jakes. 
 

 Viva la revolución, I guess?
 

 Peace"

"Hi, my partner and I have been in a relationship for about 4 months in our small hometown. Relationship Anxiety has been a part of our dynamic since the beginning with it coming out in pretty consistent ways.
 

 Her making the following anxious accusations:
 

 1. Accusations of cheating / infidelity (texting other women, ex's, dating apps) - there is no ground for this but it keep happening.
 2. Accusations that I am ignoring her needs - which she always takes back and says I go the extra mile in the relationship. But focusses on minor incidents very intently (Ex. Didn't kiss her at the start of a cooking class we are taking together when she arrived in front of the class)
 3. General anger or treating me poorly.
 

 She is seeking treatment, but doesn't effectively use the strategies recommended. She can have a counselling session on how to deal with these feelings and not employ the strategies even later that same day. It always ends up being me having to talk her through her anxiety each time, regardless of how I feel about it.
 

 The incidents are happening more often as the relationship goes on, from once every 1-2 weeks to 3-4 times a week.
 

 I think the more we talk about it, the more it is triggering her anxiety and its putting a strain on my own mental health (happiness/stress)
 

 I'm considering going a period where I internalize my feelings, work through them with my own to not add extra stress to her in the short term. To see if it helps ease her anxiety.
 

 I'm worried this will create an unsustainable situation though or just create a backlog of bad feelings to deal with later.
 

 Looking for any advice."

Recently I've been dealing with shortness of breath and other weird breathing problems. I've noticed quite a bit at work because I get so stressed (I'm switching jobs here in the next few months.) It's a super scary and uncomfortable sensation feeling like you can't breathe. Has anyone else dealt with this or have tips on how to overcome it?
"I (25f) have anxiety induced paranoia where I think everyone has bad intentions with me. I feel like people are talking about me behind my back, disrespect my belongings, and not want to be my friend/only stay because they feel like they have to. I want to cut everyone off and part of me really believes it is the right thing to do so. This is such an isolating feeling to have. Does anyone else experience this?"
"After over 10 years of putting off getting my license because of anxiety and external barriers (and also one failed road test!), I did it - I passed!!! 
 

 Something that helped me control the anxiety and dread to manageable levels was to write down only positive things about me and my experience. It's so easy to get into a negativity spiral with thoughts of ""I'm going to fail again, I haven't had enough practice, I'm bad at parallel parking, I'm such a failure"" - even stuff like ""I don't want to do this, I can't wait until it's over"". So, I switched it up - wrote how proud I am office trying, and that it's only failure if you give up - if you keep trying and don't get the results you hope for, it's learning and it's bettering yourself. Even for thoughts wishing it would be over with - I reminded myself that what I really want is to be not feeling those negative feelings, and tried to remind myself of the good leading up to it.
 

 This really helped me get ready for the road test. It wasn't always easy, but it was so beneficial!"
"For context, I’m 29F and have been suffering from driving anxiety for about 1.5 yrs. It started after experiencing a traumatic assault, not driving related. After the incident, I couldn’t drive at all without getting a full-blown panic attack. At 6 months, a lot of my driving ability had come back as long as I drove with a safe person. I still experienced regular panic attacks and figured out that being in a car at night is triggering (makes sense given the incident). So I can’t drive at night. Also I can’t drive in unfamiliar areas as that triggers me now too. I can’t drive in the rain or any inclement weather. 
 

 As of now, I can mostly drive without issue in my town as long as it is broad daylight and the weather nice. However, I still can’t drive long distances or with other people that aren’t my “safe person.” Otherwise, I will still get panic attacks.
 

 It feels like my driving anxiety stems from being scared of experiencing the panic attack itself and not feeling in control of my body(hands esp) while driving. All I can think of when I feel the panic start is how my hands start to shake and how my vision will blur. I don’t necessarily think about all the ways I could crash but I tend to focus on the “fact” that I can’t trust myself to drive right now because I know how scary these panic attacks are and what they make my body do that feels completely out of my control. Then I can only think about how terrible it would be to get stranded because I can’t drive. I tend to go down the rabbit hole from there. Overall, I think it’s like I’m scared of the fear response in my body that I haven’t healed fully yet. Idk tho, I’m just speculating, forever trying to psychoanalyze myself. I just really really hate the way this has negatively impacted my life. I want to be able to live alone again but at this point it feels like my safe person will be driving me around forever."
Hi all please need some advice i was on 150mg effexor and half of 25mg quitiapine for sleep but i was noticing myself going downhill last few months again so i got put up to 225 effexor and the 25mg i take all.

I work in retail as a manager belive it or not but thinking of packing it in i just dont know
"Hello peeps, I am desperately in need of help from experienced drivers! It is my first time posting here - so bear with me.
 

 I live in the Netherlands and have taken around 40-50 driving lessons till now (the past instructor was too aggressive so I had to change). I have also failed the practice exam two times now.
 

 What I notice while driving is that I start concentrated, so the first 30 minutes I drive pretty good. I have awareness about my surroundings and I am attentive - giving way to vehicles, bikes (a lot here in NL) and pedestrians where needed.
 

 After that I kinda get nonchalant, like I am not even feeling that I am driving. Combining this ""mindset"" with chatting w/ the instructor, I start making mistakes. I.e., don't see the red light on time (last minute breaking), at an intersection not checking my shoulder when turning left (for bikes coming from behind) - not looking ahead as I should.
 

 For the experienced drivers, what do you think the cause is of this? Any actions I need to consider to change the way I am driving? Is it because of tiredness? I am 27."
"I (29F) got married this past year. My husband (36M) told me before the wedding he “made good money” as a self-employed business owner. I was always completely transparent about how much money I made and what I had saved. With both of our families helping cover wedding costs, I contributed just over $14K out of my savings towards wedding costs. (It was not an outrageous or large wedding, we live in an expensive area.) 
 

 Fast forward to now: I’ve loaned my now-spouse $36k over the past two years to cover our shared expenses and help him pay down his credit card debt. 
 

 My net worth has decreased 42% due to the current stock market. My husband still hasn’t paid me back what I loaned him, or begun to contribute to our monthly expenses. Now I find out he hasn’t filed taxes in more than 7 years and our taxes haven’t been filed for this year. 
 

 I’m worried he is going to get caught for taxes. I’m worried he’s never going to contribute to our shared/agreed on expenses. I’m worried he can’t change. I’m worried I’ll never own a house, or have kids, because of his dishonesty, poor money habits and refusal to get a stable, W-2 job.
 

 Am I over-reacting or are these legitimate reasons to feel anxious? 
 

 TL;DR: First year of marriage financial stress has left me out around $85k and feeling totally alone while he promises “to make things right”."
"Last month I was convinced I had something wrong with my brain and luckily I got an MRI which came back normal. I felt great for a couple weeks then I started getting heart palpitations so I’m freaked out again. I’ve been diagnosed with GAD and health anxiety which has given me lots of physical symptoms over the years, but now I’m stuck on this symptom. I saw my Dr today who assures me it’s just anxiety and stress from having a two year old, getting married last week, and moving out of state next month, but he did say he wants me to wear a heart monitor for two weeks just to make sure. Now I’m even more freaked out 😩 the palpitations do seem to get worse when I think about them so I’m hoping it really is just anxiety but it makes me so nervous! Anyone else Rey these?!"
Lately I have been getting really anxious around those time in particular. Can anybody relate or maybe know an explanation why? Nothing seems terribly different at that part of the day expect I'm a lot more tired around that time.
"I'm 25, and I find that many times throughout the day I worry and fixate on dying.... whenever I laugh or joke with my parents or other people important to me, I get this...idk, impending sense of doom?
 

 Maybe it might be grief? I've lost two aunts due to cancer, and it happened back-to-back (over a year apart, in fact). That might be why my mind is revolving around this concept of dying. I tried to sit in the park very recently (my 25th birthday in fact) and I was so tense. My mind was racing a bunch.
 

 Recently, I remembered one time at an old job I had, where two customers were discussing that someone they knew had passed away suddenly despite being healthy/in shape.... I forgot about that until very recently. My anxiety has been spiking ever since then.
 

 I have no idea how to calm these thoughts. I try to exercise and eat properly, but then my mind is recently jumping back to that conversation I overheard.
 

 How do I calm these thoughts down? I keep worrying that I will end up being part of a statistic. I don't want to worry about these things, but these thoughts keep coming to my mind."
"It can be anywhere, mostly at a store..when i’m going up to talk to someone, an employee or something..i know that at any second..everyone around me is going to turn there heads to look at me..and sure enough, they all mostly do. I notice they don’t do that with other people, but the second i say something..everyone wants to turns there head and look at me..i hate it so much and i’m not sure they only do it to me..i was doordashing, walked in and asked the employee for the order..i had a weird feeling so i look around and see every employee looking at me..literally. It makes me feel like they are talking about me. It happens at work too..i’ll just be minding my own business, but i’m very away of “looks”..makes me feel judged that’s why i try not to look at other people that much. i’ve even had my team lead come up to me and say “they are just staring at you but all your doing is just working”."
Found out something today and it didn’t leave me at my best. I’m like why am I even worried about it or even care I’ve been trying my hardest to hold back a lot. But it’s best I put on an fake face. To be okay.. but I know there’s an brighter side I’ll be okay.. just gotta keep my head up
"So I am 27 and I was diagnosed first social anxious, paranoid, and narcissist while I was 15. I cope with this disease for many years by just taking drugs, Lustral.
 

 Many years passed, I was able to deal with many many problems. Nowadays, I remained under stress cause you know Pandemic and being unemployed for 3 years. But this year is more tough, I started to feel massive pain on my heart. I went to the doctor to check my heart condition and good news is I am healthy physically. 
 

 Now I believe that my disease triggers something physically everytime I am exposed to discomfort. Here the examples
 

 Looking for jobs,
 Think about my future,
 Walking in front of people in a bar cause as if they look at me,
 People laugh but I feel that they laugh to me,
 

 I go cafes three times a week alone for studying something and it is not a huge problem now. But still feel uncomfortable if the cafe is crowded.
 

 I gave up using antidepressants because I run out of money, I can not go to the doctor.
 I need different advices, no offense but suggestions like WATCH MOVIES, GO FOR A WALK, MEDITATION, SPORT, are not beneficial to me. I am sick for 12 years and these types of things could not help me. Any help? Suggestions?"
"To paint the picture I (M27) have ADHD and GAD and 3,5 years ago I have been diagnosed and treated for my GAD. I felt it went really well for 2 years after therapy, to the point I felt I had it under control and now after 1,5 years I got a bit depressed, anxious and had a panic attack 3 days ago for the first time in 2 years. I just can't understand how the control I thought I had slipped away so easy.
 

 My question is does this happen to more people and if how did you deal with it?"
"I feel like my anxiety has gotten worse lately I’m afraid of doing a lot of things and i feel like everything is overwhelming and not knowing what to do.. I never use to have it this bad now I feel like it’s just getting worse and worse.. 
 

 Need some advice on how to be better with everything.."
It’s a big part of my social anxiety. I always want to come off the best I can and I want people to like me. The thing is I overthink and I try to read people’s body language. If they are moody I always think it’s something I did wrong. I have gone out of my comfort zone to please people but no matter what I do I can’t shake this feeling. This is especially true with my coworkers and people I find attractive.
"Hi. Long story short, I began dating too early and the low self esteem mixed with that has lead to some baggage. I felt fine before, like dating was no problem and I was happy with whoever but I was never able to leave anyone, even bad relationships that made me feel used and disrespected. I wouldn’t say I was clingy, but I was very affectionate and open and hopeful about a future when I actually liked a guy and was in a decent relationship.
 

 Years later, I am now pushing people away. I doubt things, show emotions, then pull away when they show them back or I actively (subconsciously) push them away the moment I feel they are losing interest. In the beginning I am hesitant, then I get more comfortable and open up, then I push them away. The moment I am unsure or begin overthinking things. 
 

 I want to improve and be in a happy, healthy, loving, open relationship but I really don’t even know where to start. I am constantly telling myself they don’t mean it or they only think that way because they don’t know me or something else that makes me doubt they would actually stick around. Then I get short and it is even worse around my period (I plan on getting back on birth control to avoid pms until I can handle my basic emotions). I try to remind myself to be open and I get so excited to talk to them then something happens and they don’t call and it is totally reasonable but I immediately think “well it’s for the best because you were way too eager” then I’m irritable when we do talk after convincing myself to remember it will end anyway. 
 

 Sorry I am not sure where I am going with this. It is funny because I used to be the open one without reciprocation and now I am a terrible mixture of both. I open up just enough to seem sure of myself or opinionated and the rest I hide away. It gets hard to simply say I missed you. I don’t know what to do. I want to improve and have a good relationship but idk how. Is there a way to work on myself first? that is what I planned, or should I tackle this while dating? I don’t think I can handle another failed relationship. I can look at them logically but I can’t help but to internalize each one and see that I am getting worse. I am always teetering on feeling like I want love and can have it, and feeling like I am unlovable and unfixable. 
 

 I should also mention that I am still in the process of getting over someone two months later…it doesn’t help that I am comparing guys to him and upset or anxious when reminded of him suddenly. 
 

 My ideas of semi solutions involve erasing all negative things and researching different perspectives on things I think about so I am not opinionated. Maybe getting a fidget ring to slow my thinking and be less impulsive when speaking (idk if those really work). I’m open to any advice. I am at the age where my friends are getting married and I am worried that will not happen for me the way I currently am. 
 

 Sorry, I guess the short story was still long 😅"
"Hi! I am 26 F and have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety as early at 14. I’ve tried everything under the sun for my symptoms. I’ve learned to manage them the best I can. 
 

 Does anyone else feel like they downplay actual bad health symptoms unrelated to depression and anxiety, because of their years of those depression and anxiety symptoms playing out constantly? 
 

 I sometimes feel guilty for confiding in those around me about my anxiety and depression. So, when something is “really” wrong I feel very defeated and fearful. It’s so hard for me to advocate for myself concerning other medical issues when I’m constantly having panic attacks and complaining of symptoms that are “in my head”.

I also noticed (which doesn’t help with my anxiety) that whenever I walk by he looks down like nearly every time I walk by, and he sometimes does this to me in general.

"Hey guys 
 

 I recently came across this thread because I'm having anxiety about my.job and the more I read into anxiety the more I realise I'm actually in a constant anxious state.
 

 I'm 28 and had many jobs. Every job I've had I've quit because I go into a headspin if I have a bad day or a bad week. Its made worse by the fact I'm in an industry where there is a talent shortage so I'm always having recruiters offering me new things! 
 

 As I mentioned I think I'm in a constant state of mild panic. When I had a relationship last year I constantly sought reassurance from my partner and now I'm single again I'm now really worried I won't ever find love again which makes me nervous as hell on dates. The cycle continues.
 

 The weird thing is I've never had a panic attack but I'm always a bit nervous about something. Is there any advice people could give. I'm trying heavy breathing which helps, just wondering if there's anything else? All help appreciated"
"I am dealing with SA since I was 17, I am 29 now. I have been able to improve my anxiety levels in order to function ""normally"" at work and social settings in general. However, whenever I am in a social interaction, as soon as I open my mouth to speak, my whole chest, neck and face get extremely flushed. Even for minor things, like answering the phone. I am very self-conscious about it, especially at work, because it shows my insecurity, and people honestly get scared at first.
 Obviously, I try to cover my chest and neck area as much as possible, but it's not always practical. Have tried propranolol, prescribed by my doctor when I complained about stress-induced red blotches on my skin, but felt no relief. Just curious if anyone else suffers from such visible symptoms."
"Background: 26M, second year medical student, otherwise healthy. Yes I would describe myself as being anxious overall, but my bigger issues have always been with depression. I’m on two meds for that, but they are often prescribed for anxiety too.
 

 I went to sleep at around 1am and woke up at 530 with about 15-30 seconds of chest pain (it was probably MSK-related due to the position I was sleeping in). I knew one of the major symptoms of an acute cardiac event was an impending sense of doom, so I started to evaluate myself for that. I’m fairly certain that whole mental imagery thing I did was what triggered the attack.
 

 What happened next feels like a bad dream. I walked downstairs and saw my Dad sitting in the recliner. I said I didn’t feel good, paused for a few seconds, and stumbled to the couch telling him to call 911. The physical sensations were so overwhelming and intense, I’m not quite sure how to describe them. They included chest tightness &amp; palpitations (almost like my heart was slowly “sinking” to the ground). There was also a great deal of dizziness, lightheadedness, hot flashes, as well as pure and utter terror. My legs felt like they were getting heavier and heavier with each passing second. I ended calling 911 and I could barely say anything outside of “please help.”
 

 I started to feel better when the paramedics/EMTs arrived. There were also sheriffs and firefighters already there, so I felt really bad and embarrassed that I took up their time when I was probably fine. After talking with the nice people, I had my mom drive me the ER because this had never happened to me before and I wanted to make sure there wasn’t anything more serious going on. The PA I saw was not helpful. She didn’t even bring up the possibility of a panic attack, saying it was probably because I was hypoglycemic or hypotensive when I woke up. This is not likely as I am an otherwise healthy 26M with a history of anxiety &amp; lots of current stress.
 

 Anyways, what should I do now? Should I see my PCP about getting my meds changed? What about psychiatry or a LMHC? I think my biggest concern though is what do I do if this ever happens again? Sure I’m glad that I know what to expect now, but there’s no way in hell I’d be able to resist that urge to call 911 in such a horrible state."

 However I feel like it stopped working for me a few months ago which I read up on and is common. I talked to my doctor about this and they switched my medication to venlafaxine 37.5mg. This is a snri and I’m not sure if I’m going through withdrawals from my ssri or if I’m having bad side effects. My doctor assured me the transition should be smooth. 
 

 Everyday I have horrible nausea with headaches that make me sensitive to light. I have never had migraines before, or headaches regularly. At this point I’m so fed up with side effects that I’m considering stopping entirely. I know I need to ween off but it’s making me feel horrible. 
 

 I researched it and apparently there can still be withdrawals even if you are switching to another type of anti-depressant/anti-anxiety. Has anyone had similar issues? Any advice?"
"I finally got around to getting a bunch of pics, and am terrified to make my profile public. I'm just realizing how I feel like i'm a boring person, since all I do is work, go home, video games, repeat. And I don't relate to normal people who like traveling, hanging out with friends, social media, etc. Not to mention my crippling anxiety that makes me not be able to fully function as a normal human being.
 

 I'm okay with not getting many matches, but these fears terrify me. And then even if I do get a match, I would have no idea what to say and how to relate to other human beings :(. but just gonna say screw it and jump in when I find the guts to..!
 

 Also, I have no idea what sort of text I could put on my profile to make me seem interesting or fun haha. So taking advice if anyone has some :)"
"hi all, ive recently had my panic attacks under control by taking medication (Lexapro 5mg daily). last week while i was doing a quite challenging upper body weight workout, i felt my heart have these electric zaps. i completely stopped working out after with the fear that it might be heart related. 
 

 also a little background, i did an ECG test a little about a month ago and the cardiologist said it was all clear. 
 

 now i have this mild discomfort on my left shoulder blade area and i cant help but think it might be heart related :( but i really do think its anxiety related as well. im relatively healthy &amp; fit, i work out at least 3 times a week for 60 minutes."
"On Saturday afternoon we both were driving towards a hill station and got into an accident, where I was driving the car and I had to press the break pedal almost immediately meanwhile a car approaching from the back came and rammed into us. I have been having panic attacks since then and I consulted with a therapist this morning who prescribed me an anti anxiety medicine however last night when I was having a panic attack I told my boyfriend and he came to get me and took me to his house where I slept off. I kept shouting him during the call that I can't feel my hands and to cut the call and basically I was being rude to him but I couldn't think straight. Even when the cops came my boyfriend was the one handling everything and I couldn't talk at that point and I just backed away to which my boyfriend ended up comforting me. I know I did wrong and it was a lot for him as well, and everyone has a different way to handle things. 
 

 The entire time my only concern was and still is - that is he going to leave me? I know from what the things I did he has every right to walk away where I couldn't support him the way he did to me - but I am trying for him and for us. While now he has gone to the office, I am at his place and I asked him to promise me that he won't leave me and he said he won't but we need to talk about all of this and how he cannot rely on me in a tough situation. For him I would lay my life if I could. I wish I could just tell that to him. Anyways we won't have this conversation until night when he returns and meanwhile I am just trying to deal with my anxiety and not thinking of the worst scenario that he would leave me. I know he wants to talk about things and I genuinely want to hear him out his opinions and thoughts about all of this and help him in any way to deal with all of this. I am going to take some time to heal but my only concern is hearing him out right now without being an emotional mess and without having another panic attack. 
 

 How do I go about this situation? Tell me where I am wrong and I really want to have a second chance, coz I cannot imagine my life without him. 
 

 TLDR: Me (25F) and my boyfriend (26M) got into an accident, I had a panic attack and now he wants to have a serious talk"
"Hi, everyone. I (27M) just wanted share with you all the things that I go through with my anxiety. I'm still very confused about its triggers, but I guess I have identified a few. Some of the big triggers include stuff like fights or arguments, having to present or talk in front of a large crowd, being late to certain places (not to someplace I regularly go), etc. The symptoms usually are my palms and fingers going cold, heavy breathing, inability to focus on things, perspiration, etc. Sometimes when it gets too intense, the symptoms act twice the amount. I really wish I did not have anxiety, it has really caused me a lot of problems and I hate being the way I am. I was bullied and made fun of a lot throughout school and college. I'm trying to love myself but I find it really difficult to even try. I feel like the anxiety has caused a lot of self esteem issues, or maybe vice versa. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't exist. I tried therapy for a bit and it helped me for a bit, but now it's getting worse again. Sorry for the long post."
"Hello, I am new to this. First post.
 

 Basically, I have had severe anxiety for years. I tend to go into anxiety loops where I get stuck for weeks. It's v debilitating and has caused a lot of upset in my life. 
 

 Last Wednesday I got COVID. All fine, first few days high temp and felt like shit but I started feeling better Saturday and then yesterday I got hit with massive wave of panic that I haven't felt in a while. Being isolated isn't helping, but I don't feel like I have the strength to go through weeks of this again. I was wondering if it had anything to do with recovering from viral infection? I've read that can heighten anxiety but don't want to read too much as I'll start thinking I have issues I don't I am sure! Same old anxiety/panic symptoms: churning stomach, digestive issues, can't eat, pins and needles in arms and legs, tight chest, heavy head and eyes, random temperature spikes, racing thoughts...
 

 I am on sertraline and beta blockers and have been for a while, but each time I have these huge panic waves i don't find they prevent anything from happening. I spiral so quickly. 
 

 For context I am 29 yr old female, other than this I am perfectly healthy. 
 

 If anyone has any advice please share, I am honestly at the edge with everything."
"I've had a scratchy throat on and off for about a week and a half or two now. My voice something feels weak. Sometimes there's a bit of pleghm, sometimes its just scratchy. I have no idea whats going on. Does it sound like throat cancer??"
"26M
 

 So I've been taking 15mg for 4 days now and whilst I'm still anxious, the good hours are more than the bad. I'm also sleeping a lot better. 
 

 So pretty sure it's working and I just need to buckle up and stick it out.
 

 Symptoms I'm getting...
 

 - Sometimes really bad lightheadedness and unbalanced when walking around and stood up. Kind of like floor feels like it's moving up down side to side. 
 

 - Brief surges of adrenaline and shallow breathing for about 5 seconds
 

 - Minor headaches
 

 - Constant feeling of a head cold without having a cold or fever. Kind of like a whole body heavy feeling. 
 

 Does this get better? I know everyone is different so ideally only want to hear positive stories if possible. As trying to stay positive with this and give it a real good go for a few months."
"I'm not sure it really matters *that* much but I want to give myself the best foot forward when it comes to taking this new medication. The idea of taking it in general makes me nervous but I do want to try it. I'll never know if it'll work if I never try it.
 

 So what time have ya'll found it best to take it? Nighttime or Morning? And does it need to be taken strictly at the same time every night or is it okay if it varies a little bit? I try to take my birth control at the same time every night but occasionally I'm busy with something and forget till a while later. Would that be a problem in this case or is it pretty flexible? Obviously if it's not I'll just have to put more effort into making sure it's on time but I think it'd be good to know just in case. Any other helpful tips you have are welcome and appreciated! 
 

 If you're wondering, the medication itself is escitalopram/lexapro."
"Currently typing this as I'm mid panic attack so forgive me if I say something or spell something wrong. I was fine all day,but while on the phone I began to feel really anxious. DAE get a feeling where things are too good and you start to wonder if something is wrong with you? My body just feels off. I don't know how to explain it. I feel so anxious and scared. I just want to be ok again like I was earlier. I feel alone and I don't know what to do."
"I've (26m) been a member of this sub for a while - a few months ago I lived in the suburbs of a mid-size city on the West Coast of the US. I've always struggled with driving anxiety and only got my license at 21. I moved to that city in August 2020 because I work from home and found a perfect little place in the suburbs that was a cheap but spacious two-bedroom with the one downside that I had to drive for all my errands.
 

 This was tolerable for a while but then one day the infamous wildfires of 2020 hit. The sky was blood red and it was raining ash, and my city hit an AQI literally off the scale. They were estimating it may have literally hit 1000 AQI at some points which was insane. There were 50 mph winds and basically zero visibility, and my car broke down on the side of the road during this hell. I had to contact a local mutual aid group to give me a jump and get me to Autozone and get it fixed.
 

 After that, I was just totally stricken by horrific driving anxiety for a long, long time combined with pandemic depression and just could not drive even short distances without breaking down. I googled every route in advance so I could anticipate any surprises, zooming in on Google Maps to see what the exact intersections looked like. I was very reliant on others in my life, like my girlfriend, to drive me places after I made this decision of getting this place in the suburbs that started to feel more and more like a prison, especially after vaccines came out and I started wanting to go out more.
 

 My girlfriend got into a really bad car accident in 2021 but came out mostly physically unscathed. Her car was hit by a driver crossing a red light and it caused her car to literally roll over and flip. After that, it was completely unfair to expect her to drive for me and take on that burden. My gf had already been working with me on driving practice but after her accident it was so unfair to expect her to continue doing that. I felt overwhelmed by how much of a selfish asshole I had been. I was terrified of driving so I put that risk onto someone else - driving is a fucking burden and just moving that burden off myself to her didn't make it any less so. That's no way for a relationship to work.
 

 I started going to therapy. We identified a lot of the causes of my anxiety - the perception that I can't calm down and take deep breaths while driving (turns out I can, who would have thought), the fear as a POC of being pulled over by cops if I do something even slightly wrong, the shame that 16 year old kids can do this but I seemingly just can't, and just examining why the wildfires and the pandemic really drove this anxiety into overdrive.
 

 We started doing exposure therapy and going out slowly while driving (after months of just talking about the anxieties) and it wasn't always perfect - one time I missed my merge on a highway and was left on the shoulder of the road while an insane amount of cars sped by me, basically having a panic attack while my therapist was on a call. After that I avoided going out for driving exposure outside my preferred small areas.
 

 Then I started doing it again. We always had a goal in mind that I would be able to drive to the nearby city where my office was. While my work was remote during the worst of COVID, it became hybrid in spring 2022 and I needed to go in twice a week. I was stressed about this and the cost of Lyfts there and back multiple times a week and realized I would eventually have to drive or risk losing my job.
 

 It was a 15 min drive on the highway, and the highway always was my mortal foe. I placed an order at the Thai place near my office, put my therapist on a call, and this time I *did* merge. It was exhilarating. I got there, picked up my Thai food, and drove back. My driving anxiety wasn't cured, and I still can't drive like most adults my age can, but I *did* progress with the help of my therapist. And that is not nothing.
 

 But life is better now. I recently moved and live in an extremely walkable area in a really great city with loads of public transit options and an all-remote job. I haven't driven a car in a month. My gf has kept her car for the few errands we do need a car for, but she drives it so little now that a tank of gas can last her a month and a half, whereas we used to fill up almost weekly in our last place in the suburbs. I'm so thankful to now live in an area where I don't need to constantly expose myself to the anxiety.
 

 But I never would have gotten here if I hadn't first tackled it. Going to therapy, talking about my driving anxiety, confronting it...that let me keep my job and then be able to get into a situation where I don't have to drive at all. I now live in a place where my representatives and urban planners care about pedestrians and I am so thankful for that.
 

 We all deserve walkable, safe communities so we don't have to keep doing this insanely scary and dangerous activity. But it is where we are. If you live in a car-dependent place like I did and you can afford it, I strongly recommend therapy. There is no shame in it and the therapist will not be judgmental. They'll give you the tools you need to better yourself and they will work at the pace that is comfortable for you. I did mine over Telehealth but an in-person therapist could certainly be really helpful too.
 

 I am cheering for you all. You're not alone in this."
"Like I have certain conserns that I overthink over and over and I really feel like reaching out(?) here when it's getting really bad, but I'm so scared people will be like ""urgh, you again"" and complain about posting the same concern several times :( anyone else struggling with this? It's just that reddit is my main support network as I really struggle to reach out to my friends..."
"So I’ve come to realize that I don’t actually have social anxiety (SA) but rather I’m socially awkward. I’ve just come to this realization after trying to talk to one of my coworkers and having it go awkwardly wrong. After cringing 20 minutes, I did what I always do, look up random stuff. So I looked up how I felt in the moment which was awkward and it lead to me reading up on social awkward (SAw). Everything that was described about being SAw described me. It even mentioned that some people may think they have SA but they’re actually SAw.
 

 I’m sure I’m not the only one. Although I do get distressed from social situations, I think that might have to do with the fear of awkward situations rather than a fear of the situation itself. All this time I’ve just been wrong, now that I know what my issue is, I’ll be able to understand it better and hopefully find a way to overcome it."
"I have had anxiety and OCD behaviour since I was 4 or 5 years old but I have no idea how it all started or what triggered it. I am 25 years old now and my anxiety is so severe I can leave my house only once a week. I was on medication for 6 years and had therapy just as long but my anxiety is just as severe as always and nothing has helped me. One psychiatrist said I have PTSD and I was wondering if something happened when I was a kid but I just can’t remember it. On the other hand other psychiatrist said I don’t have PTSD. 
 I really want to find something to help my anxiety and I was thinking if finding the root cause could help. 
 What do you think?"
"I have anxiety every day, but the last two or three days has been really bad. I’ve been SOOO tired and feel like I’m in a fog, which has caused my anxiety to become worse. Just wondering if anyone else has noticed their anxiety being worse the last few days??"
"So I think we’ve all gone through this these last few years, right?
 

 I (25F) developed such a deep rooted anxiety of getting the virus, I’m talking still cleaning everything that comes into my house including myself. I can’t touch anything that I think could’ve been exposed to it; everything any hands can touch I clean it obsessively.
 

 You would think obvious things, like washing your hands when you get inside, and produce and stuff. Well, that, but also everything that a hand can touch, I have to disinfect. The light switches, the door handles, the fridge’s, the knobs from the stove. Every cabinet’s handle in the kitchen, and all doors. My mom is lax in comparison to me, so I feel I can’t trust her to wash her hands so I’m pretty paranoid that she will “infect “ the inside of the house. 
 I can’t touch anything when I come into the house and I haven’t washed my hands 2 times. My phone the same,: 2 disinfectant wipes every time or I literally leave it on the floor. My purse too. I get mad if ANYTHING that has not been cleaned from the outside is put on a chair in the kitchen or put at the foot of my bed. It’s affecting me So bad. If I go outside and I slightly graze my hair with “dirty hands”, as soon as I come back home, I have to shower, and I touch the shower knobs in just a certain place that I consider “dirty”, and that’s where I grao it to twist the water open; and another part of the know that’s “clean” so I can grab it to shut the water flow and not have to rehash my hands in the shower.
 

 So…yeah. I think I’m going through it. My therapist used to tell me that it might be ptsd and to try not to shower every time I went out, but I failed. Someone has felt something similar?"
"I'm (F26) on vacation with family and I'm currently in a hotel with them as we're picking a ticket for a bus for the rest of the week. And my right ear has kinda been ringing since last night before I went to sleep, and it's still ringing. (Were on the 14th floor) and just now I felt a hightened sense of fear or adrenaline out of nowhere and I felt dizzy and then I laid back and closed my eyes for a minute and now I don't want to get up lol. J c exzqzwzw●●●.... (I almost just dropped my phone on my face lol) smh... 
 

 So over the course of 2 years, how my anxiety feels has changed. It doesn't happened as often as it used to and idk what triggered it today because I wasn't thinking of anything that triggers it. Now I'm a little tired, I woke up around 9:30am and it's 10:45am now. Nothing hurts, sometimes my fingers feel tingly but they didn't this time. Hmm... I need a nap."
"Hello reddit, why do I suffer this so much.
 Literally I can't stand short answers because I automatically think I did something wrong and that the person is angry with me.
 It's really affecting my wellbeing in my job.
 I feel terrible. My bosses are super nice and friendly but when they leave me on seen or answer ""ok"" in messages, I just die inside until I personally talk to them. Same with my bf.
 I'm 27 and I hate this situation. 
 I'm going to therapy but I can't tell if it's helping"
"Hey guys, I'm 25 and I graduated nursing school a year ago. When I was 16, I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder and was prescribed Lexapro 10 mg and Vistaril 25 mg for my panic attacks. When I started college, I was able to get through school, work 2-3 jobs at a time, I had friends, I went to parties, had a normal life. Lexapro didn't really seem to do much in terms of my depression and anxiety since I still felt it and had my down days, and after I graduated nursing school and got a job that barely required me to work, I found myself having more anxiety and depression than usual. I went from taking Vistaril 1-2 every 2 weeks to 1-2 everyday. But the anxiety attacks still weren't bad, it was just to take the edge off. I reached out to a psychiatrist and he weened me off of Lexapro and started me on Wellbutrin XL 150 mg. I was on that for 2 weeks and it cured my depression, like I was in a great mood during the day, but it made my anxiety so much worse. It got worse by the day to the point where I was having panic attacks almost daily because of it so he prescribed me Wellbutrin instant release 75 mg. That medication gave me the worse migraines of my life. After that didn't work, we then tried Buspar 7.5 mg and Trazodone 50 mg to help with my insomnia. After taking Buspar and realizing nothing is working for me, my panic attacks got worse and worse and worse. It made me bedridden for almost 2 weeks straight. I reached out to my primary care physician and she prescribed me Klonopin 0.5 which is a benzodiazepam, and that seemed to work wonders for my anxiety. I then had a day where I woke up and my anxiety was already at a level 10. That day, I took 1 mg total of Klonopin and it still didn't help my panic attack. My blood pressure was reading 70/50, I was violently shaking, couldn't catch my breath, and before I knew it I was in the ER. They ran test after test after test and all my labs were normal. Sent me home with a $10,000 bill and said you just had a bad panic attack. 
 

 I've been taking 0.50-0.75 mg of Klonopin everyday for the past 2 weeks. Now my psychiatrist is starting me on Atenolol 50 mg daily to see if that'll help. I don't use reddit ever, but I can't find answers on google anymore. I went from a super productive nursing student with so much motivation and drive for my future, to now: not being able to drive, not being able to watch TV without my anxiety being triggered, all I think about is anxiety, when my next panic attack will come, I haven't seen my friends or family, only through facetime and for short periods of time. I'm grieving who I used to be before my panic disorder got so bad. When did it get so bad and why? When did I go from a straight-A nursing student to someone who is completely debilitated from her anxiety? I've become suicidal because of this, and I'm scared of telling anyone. 
 

 I wake up and all I think about is anxiety now. I don't know what else to do. My life is going downhill and I feel like I'm at rock bottom. Do panic disorders ever get better? Will I ever wake up one day and not think about anxiety? Will I be able to drive and travel again without the fear of getting anxious and having to be bedridden for the rest of the day? 
 

 All these questions that I don't have answers to. I have a bag full of 9 medication bottles, all bottles that didn't help me. Should I try TMS or hypnotherapy? I feel like I'm going insane."

"I need some reassurance about my heart
 

 Hi all, not looking for medical advice, just reassurance that I’m doing that right thing. I just need some perspective. I am 28F who is not overweight and I don’t have any medical concerns except severe anxiety. I have been having chest pains for months on and off and have had an EKG, echo, and treadmill stress test. They were all perfect. At what point can I stop with all the testing and assume the chest pain is non-cardiac? My doctor said the treadmill test was the last one I needed but my anxiety keeps telling me they missed something or that the treadmill test wasn’t that accurate. Are those tests enough to say that my heart is fine? I feel like I could keep going back to the doctor for more and more tests but maybe I need to focus on my mental health. I just don’t want to put myself in danger. 
 

 I’m scared of having a heart attack every time I get the chest pain and then it makes the pain worse. Would a heart attack at my age be rare? I don’t want to keep piling up medical bills if it is just anxiety or GERD or something. Thanks so much."
"Hi all, I'm currently living in downtown Los Angeles, working from home as a software engineer, for the past 4 months and I'm so distressed by the noise in my apartment. I've been dealing with noise sensitivity as long as I can remember. I've moved apartments 3 times now over a span of 5 years due to noise issues. Things that trigger me are music from neighbors, high pitch sounds, footstep sounds, and doors slamming shut. In my current apartment, I'm living on the top floor, but I hear door slamming sounds from my downstairs neighbors all the time. Pretty much every 10 seconds I hear a door slam. I also hear a high pitch noise from the surrounding area since I live next to solar panels... I've thought a lot about moving, but I would have to break my lease and spend thousands of dollars plus moving costs. In the meantime I've been wearing noise cancelling headphones and also just tolerating the noise, but it makes me have anxiety every day in my own apartment. I would say the amount of distress I deal with on a daily basis is 6/10. I also recently became friends with my ex again after 7 months of no contact due to us both having issues in our life and needing to support each other. Sometimes I text her when my anxiety gets unbearable and it helps to have someone to vent to. I have a therapist I really connect with as well, but he's super expensive and I only see him at breaking points due to cost. He wasn't willing to reduce his price.
 

 I feel like my anxiety over my living situation has been persistent and makes me not enjoy being by myself. I often want to be distracted by the presence of my ex physically near me so I don't have to worry about the noise. Before reconnecting with my ex, I would distract myself by using dating apps all the time obsessively, ANYTHING, to get my mind off my own thoughts and living situation.
 

 Sometimes, I have thought about moving to a more remote location away from Los Angeles, like to another state where I can afford a house. I can seriously buy a house right now if the price is under $400,000, but I'm highly reluctant to move to another state and ditch my entire family, and friends.
 

 After my breakup with my ex, I want to be more healthy and be able to finally be comfortable in my own skin, but my noise sensitivity is one of the biggest hurdles to that. How can I be happy if my life is just one huge pursuit of the next distraction to keep me from focusing on noises around me? Does ANYBODY have any advice for me. God bless you (I'm an atheist and I'm saying that, that's how desperate I am)."
"for context: i have diagnosed social anxiety and moderate depression (medicated but only half amount of recommended dosage bc of reasons) since 2021. i also have very low self-esteem in every part of my life (work, looks, personality etc.)
 

 my (27F) anxiety is mainly around men because of being bullied by boys in my class for six years in grade school. i have had difficulty speaking to men since i've been about 15, doesn't matter if they have been classmates, work collegues, friends' boyfriends or relatives. with the help of my medicine it has gotten easier but whenever i start feeling any type of feelings for a man it's like the anxiety comes back tenfold. i get scared to talk to them. 
 

 now i have met someone who is around my age who i would want to ask out on a date, but i can't because of my anxiety. i get scared that he'll think i'm weird. i'm also so scared of rejection, even if i now that logically there is nothing wrong with rejection. i'm just so scared of not being liked, that's all i want. 
 

 have any of you asked out someone you've been interested in even though you've been scared? i just felt like i needed to vent bc rn i'm just crying in my living room thinking out this."
"Alright. Hi friends. Obligatory phone post. 
 

 

 I (F27) have had a long standing anxiety, insomnia, ptsd etc which of course stems from childhood trauma. I’m working through it with my two fabulous therapist and psychiatrist. My meds were specifically selected for me because I have additive tendencies.
 

 

 Within the last year, I’ve noticed that I drink a lot during the week (not everyday). There are also days where are just don’t drink Monday - Saturday and only have. Glass and then I’m over it. Then there good be a week where I just don’t want to drink. So nothing is consistent. So first question - is this something I should be concerned about? 
 

 Whilst drinking I don’t usually realise my state so I pour that extra glass knowing it should be fine, whilst being cognisant of what’s left in the bottle, to re shelve . 
 

 

 A Main point to note, whilst receiving help, I do suffer from BED. It was my method to cope prior to finding therapists who suited and understood me and the good process we began. But I do still suffer with it. It’s curbed slightly, but now 100%. My lack of self control is quite poor. And is so demonstrated after drinking. 
 

 All of this is going on, I know I’m in a functional mania state. I know. I’ve been off 5 days from work. I’m a functional depressant right now. 
 

 

 Thank you for reading my long story, are they any advice that you could part onto Me? Happy to answer everyone in questions"
"Hi all!
 

 I am an interior designer (26F) and I just landed a job. I am getting very very stressed when I have to do a presentation or at a meeting. I know it’s my job to get with the clients and do presentations all the time have ever I have been really really anxious the past few weeks even though the work culture and people are good.
 

 Every time I’m doing a presentation even though I know I have a good eye to design my voice cracks every time I open my mouth and I know people around me can sense that. sometimes my voice is shaking due to my stress and I cannot control that. all of the people around me are native speakers and I am not and because of that I feel self-conscious, AND usually I’m not like that AT ALL! I’m an extrovert and pretty confident most of the time but whenever I’m surrounded by a bunch of native speakers I feel down! =(
 

 Sometimes I think that maybe one or 2 shots of vodka might help, lol. I’m serious — IDK, how to calm myself. If the stress is there, it’s there! 
 

 How do you handle stress/anxiety at work/meetings or presentations? 
 

 Please help!
 

 Thanks!"
"I am so upset that my anxiety prevents me from doing anything I would like to do. At this point I can’t even leave my house. I go to grocery shopping only 1-2 times a week and that’s it. I can’t study, I can’t work. I can’t travel. I can’t meet my friends. I can’t fulfill my dreams and it hurts. 
 I just watched a TV series and in it people were living like I would like to live and I got so jealous and sad. 
 I have had anxiety since I was 4-5 years old. I used antidepressants for 6 years and was in therapy for just as long but nothing has ever helped. Nothing. Now my psychiatrist is kicking me out of outpatients department because they think my anxiety isn’t bad at all. They said that I should stop using sedative medication I use only when I leave my house once a week and to just start going outside and to places. I just can’t do that. And if I do, I’ll get traumatized. This has happened before. I need to be in a certain mindspace to be able to challenge myself but now my anxiety is just too severe to be able to do that. 
 Honestly, I don’t know what to do. I am so alone with this matter and so hurt that no one is willing to help me. I am devastated and just so tired from trying to get better and trying to get help. I feel like giving up. Some years ago I got depression because of my anxiety and then I got help for it and eventually got cured. Now I’m ’just’ anxious and no one wants to help."
"So I’ve (25f) struggled with social anxiety for a long time and it’s definitely got worse over the years. I had to be signed off work for a month due to my mental health and now that I’m back there’s quite a few new faces and a lot of the people I used to speak to have left now. I’m awful at starting conversations with people I just never know what to say and feel like they don’t want to be talking to me. Today at work (I just work in a supermarket btw) I made the effort to start up a conversation with a cute guy that seems to work the same days as me. We were down the same aisle so I just said “so how long have you been working here then?” and he told me so I asked him how he was finding it and we spoke for a little bit but then conversation died and he didn’t ask me anything. I was kinda proud of myself for doing it but at the same time I left feeling a bit like I was just annoying him and we didn’t say anything else for the rest of the shift. I hate being like this, I’m so jealous of people that can have conversations so easily! I can’t tell whether he’s just kinda shy or whether he doesn’t want to talk to me. Can anyone give me any tips or feedback on conversation ideas or just how to get over this in general"

"Really struggling with this one the last few days, and very likely have another 2 months of dealing with this stressor: my roommate. 
 

 Things have been pretty rocky from the start, but especially so the last 2 months. He seems to have rules that only apply to me even though he suggested some and agreed to others. THey're always stupid things like temperature control or putting things back after using it (within a reasonable time frame). 
 

 However, he doesn't do these. Every week the last few months or so, he is slowly turning the temperature down more (even after management told us to have it a solid 5-10 degrees higher because of heat waves). During this time he would constantly turn it down. Then after the waves were kind of over, he'd turn it down even more. The last week or so, its' been even lower - lower than the temp we mutually agreed on a year ago. This isn't the only agreement he has gone back one, but all of them are pretty petty and insignificant. Another one is using some oven baking materials of mine (perfectly fine to use) and then just leaving it on the counter. I'll move it back to his side reminding him to put it back. He'll just move it to my side even though he knows damn well i didn't use it. This will literally go back and forth several times. To actually put the stuff away is basically the same distance and effort away.
 

 I genuinely think he is pushing and prodding to try and subtly annoy me and take advantage. Whenever he's done stuff like this in the past, if i react, he gives it back worse. If i don't react, he'll slowly keep pushing and taking what he can.
 

 So my question now is, should i retaliate or just ignore things (which as someone with pretty bad anxiety undiagnosed, will internally continue to wreck me - already had one panic attack yesterday and today.). Talking to him is also not really an option. We are not on speaking terms and i don't really want him in my life at all anyway."

"Anyone else feel a dull chest pain like in the sternum area more noticeable when I talk sometimes maybe the exertion of talking and then when I get up from standing when my heart pounds (I feel every feeling in my heart) for a bit I get the dull center feeling then it goes away after seconds!
 

 My upper back is chronically tight and painful and parts of my sternum and under my left breast is always tender to the touch! Maybe that’s what is causing the dull pain? 
 

 I had 3 echocardiograms, 3 holter monitors for a week each, TTT, stress test, EKGs, chest and spine x rays, spine MRI. 
 I have a naturally high heart rate too but my resting is fine."
I would like to be in a relationship and find a lifelong partner but I can’t meet new people or spend time with anyone else except my closest family members because of my severe anxiety. I feel like I’ll end up being alone the rest of my life.
"Hello, I have health anxiety in combination with social anxiety, I'm 27 years old guy.
 

 Since last year is worse, it's affecting my life.
 

 For example back in the days It was fun to watch a movie at cinema, now I have mini panic attacks, in the middle of the movie I told my gf that I don't feel good and I want to go home, it happened twice in a row 2 months ago and now I don't want to go anymore.
 

 Same with poker with the boys at night or a sunny day at a resturant, I'm so happy when we are going home, sometime I lie that I have to go because I feel dizzy or something, basically I avoid going to places like normal people, to enjoy a coffe and so on..
 

 Also drinking alcohol, when I'm drunk I'm laughing because I don't feel anxiety at all and I'm telling myself that I'm invincible and the next day all day long I'm really anxious, almost crying and terrified, so I don't drink alcohol now because I know how bad it will be the next day.
 

 I really like staying at home watching movies, animes, I enjoy this 100% since I was a kid. I enjoy staying at home (covid lockdown) it was nice staying with my gf at home.
 

 I have everything I want, I enjoy my job, everything is so good in my life but health anxiety is taking away all the good things I have, I hate it. \[I feel so bad for people which have real health problems :(\]
 

 I don't know if there are people with these 2 types of anxiety, and how they handle this.., therapist does not work for me, I'm looking at them like a normal people like me, they can die, they can feel fear so It's not helping me telling that I have nothing to worry about or that I can't control these things..I already know this without paying huge amounts of money..
 

 If anyone feels the same, I want to share this: I have whaterver I want, best gf, money, job which I really like, I'm good looking but does not matter, I'm praying for all of you.
 

 Sorry for the long post and for the bad english."
"My brother is 27 and I, female and29 in 15 days, live with my mom. My dad lives in another state and is trying to focus more on his other family because My brother does not take meds. 
 

 My mom has been through it since he went into a rage 6 or 7 yr ago and trashed our house when he got angry that My mom did not want to pay his phone bill, because he loses phone every two weeks. He eventually gets thrown out of the house because my mom gets uncomfortable with him, but then he is on the street and he gets picked by the police and they take him to the hospital; the hospital calls mom, mom takes him back because they gave him meds, and the cycle continues. 
 

 Every time my mom says to him ""it looks like he is getting better"" but the hospital just forced him to take his meds and it usually takes like two weeks for the hospital meds to fully leave his system before he goes through his mania. Through all this he has not been taking any meds. My mom tells him to take his meds and he can stay at the house, but he always stays and then she has to call the police when he goes through mania.
 

 I am very stressed out to the point where I am picking at my skin. I just started anxiety meds and I feel like I was making progress until we had to call the police again today. It is stressing me out that my mom is stressing out."
"My (27F) girlfriend (34F) have been dating for almost a year. We both have anxiety disorders, but they present themselves in very different ways. Mine is more of a “constantly worrying that the sky’s falling type” but hers is more of a debilitating “that makes me anxious so I can’t do that thing” type. I love my girlfriend very much, but we get into these moments where I start to resent her anxiety for the things it won’t allow her to do. For example, this weekend we went camping together. I realized as I started cooking dinner over the fire that I had forgotten to fill up our water jug. I asked her to take my car and drive around the campsite looking for a water Spicket to fill up the water jug. She told me driving my car alone made her anxious and that she couldn’t do it. I explain to her that she had driven my car before and she had been fine, and that I needed water but she refused to do it. I also couldn’t leave her to cook while I go look for water, because she doesn’t know how to cook. So I ended up finishing cooking, and then we both had to go look for water. The next day we got home and we needed to pick up my dog from my friend who is dog sitting her, and wash our clothes. Our dryer is broken so we asked my next-door neighbor and good friend if we could borrow hers to dry our clothes in, and she said yes. I asked my girlfriend if she could put the clothes in the dryer while I went to go pick up the dog. She said going over to my friends house to put our clothes in the dryer by her self made her too anxious and she couldn’t do it. I told her she had been to this friends house many times before and has hung out with this friend probably 30 times over the past year, so she should know her well enough to go over and throw some clothes in the dryer, but she refused. She also couldn’t go pick up the dog because the dog was at another one of my friends houses and that would make her anxious to so she couldn’t do that either. So it is in these types of moments that there lies the problem. Her anxiety makes her not able to do things, and so then I just get a longer laundry list of things that I have to do instead. This doesn’t happen all the time but when it does I end up feeling resentment because I don’t feel like I have a partner helping me with the things I need help with in our relationship. Since my anxiety doesn’t present itself in this way, my view of it is that if she’s constantly just like “nope, too anxious, won’t do it,” she’ll never have the opportunity to overcome that anxiety and prove to herself that she’s capable of these things. I’ve talked to her about that before and told her that I don’t get angry in these moments but do get annoyed when it feels like I’m not getting the help I need. How can I best help her in these moments and how can I get the help I need from my partner?"
"Hi everyone, I’m sorry this is going to be a lengthy post but I’d appreciate any advice more than you know. I’m really struggling. I have diagnosed severe OCD but it’s getting out of hand. I’ve had several obsessions in the past but my newest one was triggered when my boyfriend (25M) scheduled his knee replacement surgery. Yes he’s young for that and it’s the last option if he wants to get rid of his pain. I was so happy for him at first because he’s wanted this for a while but then I got an intrusive thought about how he could die during the surgery or after because of it. And I haven’t known peace since…I literally have googled and learned everything there is to know about the surgery and its risks even though it’s a pretty standard procedure. Anyway I’ve had several intense break downs and very very bad compulsions. It got to the point where I track his location on find my friends every time he leaves his house and have even missed work to drive to his house when he didn’t answer because I was convinced he was dead. While prepping for his surgery I found that him and his family has a history of Marfan syndrome and that cause a prett bad spiral even though he told me it’s nothing. But I was convinced he had a heart defect because of it and pushed him to get checked out and it turned out he didn’t. A few days before his surgery he wanted to come over even though my roommate had symptoms of Covid and he told me I’m being paranoid. I decided to not let my anxiety take over and he actually ended up with Covid so I quarantined with him and risked getting Covid myself again because I was so worried for him. His surgery got rescheduled to 8/17 and now I have even more time to worry about it and I’m scared Covid will have lasting effects. I saw a tiktok of a girl this morning saying her dad had a very rare autoimmune disease triggered because of long Covid and how he’s in really bad shape and I can’t stop comparing the symptoms to my boyfriends symptoms and have already learned about the disease. I have no life any more because of this. I’ve given up on my dream to go to med school even though I was so acccomlished because I can’t focus and I spend my entire day googling and worrying about him. I keep reading stories about widows and having panic attacks because I’m convinced he’s going to die. This isn’t me I’m not usually like this in relationships and I’m so miserable. Please help"
I have severe case of social anxiety and I’d love to hear what things have helped you to overcome it!
How do you cope with the fact that in the next year your long term significant other will likely be moving away? (We’ve been together for 2.5 years and he’d be gone for 3-5 years) and knowing that it probably won’t work out?): I know it’s not for awhile but it’s hard to not think about and worry about.
"For a short summary, I (26F) live with my relatives. The most that cause me stress is my aunt (47F) and my sister (19F). They bicker all the time and expect me to fix their problems with one another. They both aren't at home for a week. it's the 3rd day now, yet I feel stressed like they're still here. I have been diagnosed with persistent depression, I stopped my meds for over 2 yrs now, I'd like to say I'm doing fine but all I've just been doing is ignore these negative feelings, I'm just waiting to find work and live on my own. Hopefully support myself and pay for my own meds (my aunt was the one paying before).
 

 I feel like I just want to cry and sleep. Nothing happened bad this couple of days, yet I feel like I'm on the edge of having a mental breakdown."
"Does anyone feel like they're just riding a rollercoaster of anxiety? Mondays are always the worst for me.
 

 Any advice for how to lessen the effects?"
"Hey everyone, I've been struggling with anxiety &amp; panic disorder for the better part of 11 years. I've been through Paroxetine, Escitalopram, Fluoxetine, Venlafaxine, Clomipramine, Mirtazapine, Quetiapine, Olanzapine, Abilify, Oxazepam, and Xanax. Currently I still take Escitalopram 20mg and Xanax as needed. But I read a lot about Buspirone and asked my psychiatrist if I could try it. He prescribed it in a dose of 5mg once a day to take along with the Escitalopram. But now I'm scared to start it. Especially after horrid side effects I experienced with Clomipramine, Abilify and Fluoxetine. Clomipramine even had me going to the E.R. twice. But I can't live with this anxiety anymore. So what are your experiences with buspirone? Did it relieve anxiety and panic attacks? What side effects did you have (if any) and how long did they last? Are you taking it alongside an SSRI like me? Did it improve your libido?"

"Guys. I started a new job about 2 months ago and I feel miserable. It's my first job and I'm always unsure about EVERYTHING. I keep making mistakes that my colleagus need to fix, I don't really know when it's ok to ask for help, I'm slow, I'm weird. I'm quite sure everyone thinks I'm dumb. I also need to be constantly super careful because my job involves money and I feel SO unsuited for this. My anxiety makes everything way too difficult and I can't talk about this with anyone because I feel like an idiot. Is it normal? Will this feeling go away? I'm tired of waking up with this sense of impending doom!"
"I'm 28F and have always suffered with PTSD, anxiety and mild depression although I'm extremely high functioning (run my own business, social, in a solid relationship etc ) .I usually take Alzam or Xanor when I'm feeling panicked.
 

 I started taking 50mg Serdep in April as I was going through alot and struggling to cope and it went fine for a while until I noticed my productivity went all the way down and I started becoming really apathetic. 
 

 I decided to stop them around mid May and went cold turkey, 3 days later I starting getting severe upper abdominal ""pressure"" which feels like someone is pressing into my diaphragm, it also swells up as I get extremely constipated ( I've had these all my life but only usually if I over eat which hasn't happened in about 2 years). These ""spasms"" or extreme upper abdominal spasms lasted 3 weeks and after 3 session of colon hydrotherapy, laxitives and xanor daily, finally stopped.
 

 I thought it might have been caused by the antidepressant and resumed taking about a week after I stopped in the first place. 
 

 2 days ago I tried to ween myself off Serdep again by taking half my 50mg tablet a day and lo and behold, the spasms have started again. 
 

 I really want to get off Sedep, but the spasms are debilitating. 
 

 I honestly don't know what to do. Has anyone experienced the same thing?"
"Hello all, 
 

 I've been struggling with an anxiety disorder for almost a year now. I've been to the pits and I've been on the recovery path for a few months really starting in April. I've come a long ways from being a home body and unable to cope with life to getting back to living slowly. Occasionally, maybe even most days, I still struggle with feeling ""empty"". I find it hard to describe but often I feel like my personality I used to have is gone, I neither feel anxious or sad or happy or anything really, I tend to do work on auto pilot without really thinking about what I'm doing or feeling confident that I'm right. I know this is common and the way I see it is that I've spent months being incredibly anxious and worried that my brain and body need a break. This is ok too, really this beats the constant worry I had. But it seems to be taking months. I've resolved to try and power through it by continuing to work and do normal things but it's a struggle. I physically feel like my head is empty sometimes just an absolute space cadet. It's not brain fog really, I feel like I can think if I force myself to and get things done which was really difficult earlier this year with the fog. 
 

 I'm thinking of firing up some more meditation (it helped a bit to get to this point) and I've been doing exercise steadily for a while. The only other real issue I still have on a daily basis is neck and shoulder tension/pain that I've been focused on trying to ease for a few weeks. Any other tips or anything you can think of that relates?"
"So I (29M) started having really bad anxiety the last 12 months. I saw a medical professional and got some medication which has since helped, but I feel like I need to change the way I think about life in general but im not sure how to change what drives the way I think. I have always cared way too much about what people think and my confidence in myself is very lacking because I always doubt myself. I overthink things way too much, as soon as I think someone is disappointed in me or im not doing good enough at my job it creates such bad anxiety and I keep over thinking everything into this endless tangent.
 

 Background:
 

 My self esteem has always been built upon my job success, by being recognized at work. I felt I was never socially accepted or good enough growing up, so I dove head first into working at 16 and have worked my way up to earning $65K a year without a college degree. I built all of my mental secuirty and happiness on being succesful with my career. Through that developmental period I saw major success with my dedication to the jobs I worked which caused me to never really have anxiety until recently.
 

 I am very introverted/quiet/observant person, I feel like its a defensive shield to avoid emotions.The first 3 years at my current job were so amazing, I worked overnights for 3 years and because of the great job I did I was promoted to dayshift and relocated to a new city/got a 30% raise, I couldn't turn that down! This is where my anxiety starts...
 

 I struggled a lot with the change of social interaction initially because working overnights I never had to interact with so many people directly that it really took a toll on me mentally. I have a really hard time concentrating with so many people interacting with me directly that I get really anxious and can't perform at 100%. When I am alone and not being talked to directly by co workers I am able to perform really well. With 20 people reporting directly to me, many of them have abrasive personalities that have caused me to doubt myself and my resolve has waivered.
 

 Currently I am in talks to relocate back to where I grew up and will keep working for the same company, however I don't think they are too happy with needing to move me back, so I have been overthinking everything way too much/getting cold feet as I feel as though my boss isn't happy with me any more even though my performance has been good.
 

 There is a large level of uncertainty with moving back thats causing me massive anxiety, and being at this job the last year has me thinking very critically about how I can change the way I go about life, I want to be confident and not doubt myself but the anxiety is so bad.
 

 Any advice/coping strategies would be greatly appreciated.
 

 I have tried mental reinforcement, that moving back to where I grew up will be extremely beneficial and I try to keep telling myself in my head that my job doesn't define me."
"My boyfriend (24M) and I (25F) have been dating for almost 2 years. The relationship has been pretty great and I’m really happy with him. 
 

 The issues for me is I always have this immense anxiety that something is going to happen to cause the relationship to end. We talk everyday and see each other a couple of times a week. We’ve even talked about possibly moving in together sometime in the future. He always tells me how happy he is being with me and how much he loves me. When we’re hanging out and talking everything is fine and I have no worries. It’s when we are apart like at work or just busy with other stuff that sometimes my mind starts overthinking. Or I’ll see that he’s active on social media but he hasn’t talked to me in a couple hours so I’ll think he’s upset with me or maybe talking to someone else more interesting. I know I shouldn’t do that but my overthinking and anxiety gets the better of me sometimes. 
 

 He’s never really said or done anything to make me think that I have anything to worry about, but sometimes I just can’t help it. I’m always afraid that one day he’s going to wake up and realize that he could do so much better and that he’s just wasting his time being with me. 
 

 This is my first relationship so that could maybe have something to do with all of these feelings, but just wondering if anyone has any advice for how to deal with them? It’s obviously not good for my mental to be thinking these things all the time and also definitely not good for my relationship. Any advice would be helpful. 
 

 Thanks!"

"I am 25f living with my boyfriend 29m. We had two pet rabbits, one of which I had prior to meeting bf. She is 6 1/2 years old. Our other rabbit we got together. The rabbit we got together passed away very tragically this past February. It was absolutely traumatic and heart breaking for me. I now struggle taking care of my 6 1/2 year old rabbit. She's getting older, so with that comes some issues. I worry about her constantly to the point I feel sick. I have a hard time completing work because I get so anxious thinking about it. I love her dearly and I absolutely would never rehome her. But this is driving me mad. I give her the best care I possibly can but its tearing me apart mentally. Does anyone have any advice?"
"To give some context, I've always had pretty bad anxiety, and occasionally insomnia.  When I (27F) was younger, I was in a car accident where luckily nobody was physically hurt. Drunk driving was a thing I grew up with, so naturally I always disliked being in a vehicle and as a kid, my insomnia would act up and leave me with vivid nightmares about driving a vehicle. I've been driving for a while now, and I can't really shake the anxiety that I'll one day cause or be in an accident, since everyone insists it's a right of passage. I'm not sure how to approach addressing this in a healthy way, since I already don't ever drink and drive, take sleeping pills to ensure adequate sleep and I have never been in an accident while driving before.  
 

 I genuinely feel that this kind of anxiety isn't helpful, so I'm seeking a reccomendation."
"I have a tightness in the area where the sternum is, burping a lot, trouble breathing, pounding fast heart rate always, bubble feelings cracking in the center, gurgling stomach, stiff upper back, etc I already been to cardiology for 2 years to get checked and neurologist today again she said anxiety. Had my oxygen level checked with the finger device and it’s 98%. What do I do? It sucks and when I’m sleeping my heart rate is fine and I don’t feel these symptoms…"
"I have really bad anxiety. I'm 29 yrs old and I still don't have my drivers license. I have tried multiple times to try and get them. I keep failing the test because my anxiety gets to me and I completely forget what I've studied beforehand. Recently, I have made myself learn to drive on my own time and I'm ready to officially get my license.
 

 I know, (or at least I'm hoping) that I can't be the only one to have came this far in life and not have gotten there drivers license. I don't tell many people in my life that I don't have them. The only ones that know are my family and close friends. I always get embarrassed when I tell people. I just don't want to feel alone in this."
"Hello! I'm looking for someone who might have gone through something similar.I've decided to spend a few weeks with my boyfriend in his home country, but he works full time and most of the day he is not home. However, as the day approached, my anxiety levels started to increase like they didn't in a long time. I found myself having the same intrusive health thoughts again, and since my biggest fear is 'the heart' I'm afraid that being in another country, if something does happens, no one will understand me. Nonetheless, I've decided to embrace this journey, because I really do want to improve my self esteem and believe in my abilities.But Jesus, this is hard for me. I don't want to put all the pressure in my boyfriend, I want to be able to do it myself and finally feel like a grown person.Does anyone ever went through something similar? Being alone in a another country while suffering from any anxiety disorder?
 

 I'm 29 yo, I feel like I'm 15... not being able to be away from my comfort zone."
"I (27m) have been working at my current job for about 4 months now. I’ve always been quiet and just don’t know what to say in group situations. One on one I can talk quite a lot but it takes me a long time to get to that point with someone. 
 

 Everyone in the office is lovely and sits around talking to each other while I’m just sat at my desk in silence. They try to include me and I’ll go to lunch and things with them but still tend to just sit there. There was a works night out last month that i was excited for since it might be a chance to actually start talking to people but I ended up leaving very early and just had to hear about it from other people while they just said I was sensible for leaving early. 
 

 There’s another night out coming up but they have made a separate chat on social media where me I don’t have them on. It’s not like they’ve deliberately excluded me I don’t think but it’s just they don’t expect me to go since I don’t talk. I don’t go out for lunch as much since they don’t really ask anymore so I just sit at work and speak about twice a day. I just have no idea what to say on group situations especially when I’m not too familiar with the topic being discussed. 
 

 Outside of work I pretty much only have 2 friends and one lives over the other side of the country so I don’t really have a social life. 
 

 Does anyone have any advice?"
"Hello everyone, 
 

 A little less than a month ago I (26F) took my dad (60M) to get a colonoscopy and when he came out if it the doctor told us he had cancer. Ever since that day I have not known peace. I wake up every single day with insane anxiety to the point that I throw up. I dont have an appetite anymore and dont even really want to leave my house. My dad seems to be positive about it but I know deep down he is stressed out as well (I dont live with him so i dont see him). 
 Whenever he calls me I go into a state of panic bc I’m scared of what he’ll tell me. The topic of cancer triggers me so much I feel like I’m living outside of my body when I hear the word. I cant keep living like this. The doctors have been doing scans but so far all I know is that there are two options: removal or chemo and then removal. 
 I feel like I need to be on some sort of medication in order to feel normal bc I am constantly on edge. I’ve never been on meds but both of my parents are on anti anxiety and anti depressants &amp; I’m scared to tell them how I feel. I’m old enough to go to a doctor on my own but i dont even know where to start to get medication. 
 I’m scared to lose my dad even though I dont even know if thats going to happen. Doctors are nice and optimistic but I’m lost because i dont know if that is genuine or not."
"I'm a 26 years old person living with their parents. I have a dream to work in Europe but yet, I can't even buy bus ticket without my mom's help. I feel like I can't do anything without relying someone. Even if I can find a friend by miracle after a certain time i feel needy of them. Of course that will ruin our friendship in time. I am in the summerhouse of my parents and I can't even go to beach by myself. Whenever I talk to a stranger in the middle of talking I'm starting to wait my mom to speak for me.
 

 It really bothers me so I tried to buy the ticket to our home. The departure time was at the noon. We went to bus station and waited. It didn't come because I bought the ticket with a different departure location. While we return to home I cried. I feel like a failure. When my peers or my younger friends made it to Europe I am still incapable of doing my own things. Does anybody feel the same?"
"I recently went for an annual physical with my Primary Care Doctor, and I opened up and told her that I've been experiencing anxiety issues, mainly social anxiety. She asked me some more probing questions and determined that I did exhibit higher than average levels of anxiety. She of course recommended therapy and asked if I was interested in trying medication. I told her I was curious about trying a medication, and she thought Propranolol would be a good fit for me, since you take it as needed like before an anxiety provoking situation. So I took it for the first time a couple weeks ago before going out to a social event and I really felt a difference. The normal physical symptoms that I would have experienced (racing heart, sweating, face feeling hot), felt more dulled than usual and I was able to feel more relaxed. I can definitely see this being beneficial for me in future situations. I've had trouble starting therapy cuz it's so hard to find a good therapist, but I've been practicing meditation and mindfulness for a while which seems to have helped me a lot as well. Sorry if this is TMI, I'm just happy to find out that this actually worked for me lol Has anyone else had success with medications or having a helpful coping technique that you use?"
"I think I’ve spent so much time just not feeling that moments of emotional significance, like asking a girl out, feels so emotionally draining. Wondering if others feel the same way. The feelings are so intense that I don’t understand how people life with such emotions."
"Possible trigger warning (death etc) (26F)
 

 I’ve always had pretty bad anxiety, as I am a survivor of early childhood abuse, and then an abusive relationship in high school with continual childhood abuse simultaneously. 
 

 I suffer from some dissociation and use to have depersonalization but a lot of that reduced once I found my now current boyfriend. Unfortunately during the already extremely difficult pandemic, we got into a car accident with 7 of our friends one of them dying. It was a hit and run. I thought he was dead (my current boyfriend of 4 years) he also was worried as we were all separated in the hospital and because it was Covid no one could come and see us it was extremely hectic and traumatic. 
 

 Before this accident I use to be able to see my future and be excited for it. After this accident, and this whole pandemic it feels as though I don’t know what to expect and don’t really find myself looking forward to things as it feels like I’m just so continuously used to trauma. I struggle with health anxiety as well, and sometimes my ocd comes into play with these thoughts I have. 
 

 Is there anyone else whose struggled with this in the past or currently struggles with it? I just really want to dream again, and look forward to a future, but now it feels like I don’t see one. Especially with how our current world is recovering from something so traumatic, and feels like the trauma is never gonna stop. 
 

 Just being a survivor of trauma at such a young age I didn’t think I’d have to keep going and going. And instead of being excited for the future I just feel scared I won’t have one. I’m 26, female."
"I’m 28F and have had “anxiety” for about 2 years but suffered from mental health issues for a long time. I feel like my anxiety is really weird though - I don’t really worry much about stuff and nor do I get panic attacks, I just really often (like everyday) have a feeling which is a mix between feeling nervous for an exam (nauseous, frequently peeing etc.) and feeling like a baby (loud noises make me cry, always wanting to be wrapped up in a blanket even if it’s hot etc.) Has anyone else experienced these things? I don’t really know how to move past them, it feels horrible. (I am waiting for a psych appointment and am currently being seen by my GP)"
"I took antidepressants for my anxiety and panic disorder for 6 years and stopped taking them 1,5 years ago because they made me feel sick. I had tried 5 different medications. After I stopped taking them my depression got cured. (I developed depression because of my anxiety) Now my anxiety is so severe I can only leave my house once a week and when I do that I’m miserable. There are so many things I’d like to do but I can’t because of my anxiety. I’ve been in therapy since 2015 but they are going to cut me off because they think my anxiety isn’t severe enough. And to be honest, therapy hasn’t helped at all with my anxiety. 
  
 My brother has anxiety too and the medication he takes has helped him tremendously and I’m jealous of that. I used to use the same medication and I was very active at that time and even got into a relationship. But, the side effects were too severe and I had to stop using it. 
  
 I don’t know what to do. I want to live, Not just be alive. But I don’t miss that buzz feeling in my brain and the odd feeling I had all the time when I used antidepressants. I felt I wasn’t being myself."
"I (25M) have been having panic attacks for about 5 years now. I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression, and I've been on and off medication since then. Almost all of my panic attacks seem to be triggered by working. This first started when I worked at a poultry plant as a QA. I had been feeling very anxious because of something that happened earlier( I don't remember what it was). I went in to work and had a panic attack while filling out my paperwork. After that, I started having them every couple of days. I eventually was put on FMLA because I expressed that I wanted to hurt myself during them. I eventually left the job to move to another state with my wife( then girlfriend), but the panic attacks haven't stopped. I've been on medication for them before, and am trying to get on it again currently. The attacks have only gotten worse, and I can't keep a job because just being at a job causes me to panic and leave. I don't know what to do, because I'm the only source of income for myself and my wife, but I'm so terrified of working. I've had to repeatedly ask others for financial help, but I don't want to burden them to take of myself."
"I am a 26M from India. I have a great fear that people will judge me and laugh at my failure. This fear has kept me from learning to drive a bike. I know this fear is all in my mind but I can't do anything about it. Everytime I want to try new things, my heart starts beating faster and then I give up on the idea. I guess I am too influenced by what others would think of me.
 

 Please give me some tips which I can use. Thanks in advance."
"So I'm not gonna lie, I'm extremely sedentary. I know it's not healthy and that it probably contributes to how bad I feel. I've heard/read from many sources that exercise can help people with anxiety get better. The problem is a lot of my physical symptoms consist of things like feeling like my chest is tight, feeling short of breath, fatigued, dizzy/light-headed, and achy pretty much all the time as of late. Anytime I try to exercise I immediately become excessively aware of my heart rate, breathing, how heavy my limbs feel, and other uncomfortable symptoms which only makes me feel more anxious. 
 

 I become scared that somehow if I push myself, like actually try to get some cardio that my heart rate will stay high, I'll start getting skipped beats, and I'll feel really short of breath, whether from the exercise triggering heightened anxiety or otherwise. I know people say to start slow but even walking feels like a lot and doesn't feel like it really makes enough difference the either. Before anyone says anything, leaving the house and socializing also makes me anxious so using those things to distract myself while being active wouldn't help.
 

 If you felt the same way I do how'd you get past it and start exercising? How long did it take you to get used to it? Did it help? What kind of exercise did you do? Any other tips you can offer?"
"29m, Washington State. I've had OCD my whole life, diagnosed at 11. I'm married to the love of my life and we've been together 6 and a half years.

"Hey all, I'm a 25M and I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and severe anxiety. My doctor prescribed Qelbree for me (200MG first week, 400MG) afterwards. I'm currently on day 5 but I'm not feeling any different. My restless leg syndrome has mostly gone away, but otherwise, I feel the same. Most importantly, I'm getting anxiety from the medicine not working. How is Qelbree going for adults? Especially those with severe anxiety and ADHD. I'm driving myself crazy here.
 

 On a side note, now that I know I have anxiety, I'm even more anxious because I realize I'm getting anxious. Does anyone have any help or experience escaping that vicious circle?"
"I needed something stronger for plane flights than Ativan (I was taking 3mg and still having a horrendous time) so my psych prescribed .5mg Xanax. She told me to test it out at home before trying it on a flight, and thank goodness I did because it straight up did not work? I tested it last night, and it was mildly sedating but had no effect on the intense rumination / panicking I was experiencing. Yet for some reason the rebound anxiety I've experienced today has been absolutely brutal. Has anyone ever had this happen?"
"After years of dealing with SSRIs / their side effects / them crapping out on me, and having tried everything else under the sun, I worked with a new doc to try lamotrigine. Holy hell was it the wrong drug for me. I haven't been that bad since COVID hit – it was the first time I've ever ended up in the ER for what turned out to be anxiety. I recently switched onto Prozac, but the lamotrigine was making me actively worse (i.e. taking the pill would make symptoms worse, not just fail to treat the anxiety) and hasn't washed out yet and the Prozac hasn't come fully on board yet.
 

 I went from someone who was functional, working full time, had hobbies, was relatively active, still not perfect symptom-wise but in a place where I could've worked on it, to someone who cannot properly assess risk or make a decision, is overcome by anticipatory grief, and can barely eat or get out of bed. In the span of less than a month. My poor sweet cat (who I'm dependent on for emotional stability) even picked up some of my anxiety and had a flareup of his urinary issues, which of course makes me worried sick for him and for me and makes everything worse. And this is all because I wanted a pill that would resolve everything instead of just one that made me functional enough to do the work I should've been doing (picking up an exercise routine, making more friends, etc). 
 

 I'm hoping things will turn around within the next week or so as the Prozac takes over, but this is not the summer I wanted, and I'm now looking at going into my next semester of grad school (a crucial one) with more burnout. I'm 29 and I feel like I've lost most of my good years to this disease. I'm living 13 hours away from home and I'm so lonely and sick."
"Not sure where else to post this, but I need some advice.
 

 My parents sent my twin sister to live with me (26F) for over a month in another country.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 My sister has had severe anxiety for over 10 years. She has never had a full-time job, and has been living at home since graduating university over 3 years ago. Earlier this year, I contacted therapists and got her into therapy myself after years of my sister saying she would do it herself. My parents pay for everything (phone bill, food, etc.). Recently they started realizing that my sister has a problem and they have been venting to be about it.
 

 Long story short, when we turned 26 my sister was kicked off of my parents' health insurance plan since they live in the USA. Everyone knew this was coming and from what I understand every 26 year old in the United States goes through this. The extension they applied for was denied, and she will not have health insurance again until the end of the summer when they can pay for a separate plan or until she gets a job that has health insurance benefits. My sister does not have ongoing medical issues, but my parents felt uncomfortable about her being in the United States without health insurance and called me. The conversation went like this:
 

 Mom: ""Sister was denied the health insurance extension, so she won't have health insurance for over a month. She can buy travel insurance, so we were thinking it would be a great opportunity for her to travel since she can use travel health insurance.""
 

 Me: ""Oh great, do you want some recommendations on where she can travel?""
 

 Mom: ""No, we were thinking she can come visit you""
 

 Me: ""Maybe, but I live with my partner and have a small apartment, she can only stay on my pull out couch and it would mean we cannot use my office/living room for over a month-""
 

 Mom: ""What a good idea that would be so fun for her! See sister, they do care about you and want to help!"" (I was unknowingly on speakerphone)
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 So my parents bought her the first plane ticket to visit me, and she has been here for over a week. So far it has been awful for me. My sister refuses to go to a café or leave during the day, so she is often sitting behind me while I'm working my full-time job. She sometimes shuts down and just sleeps during the day. She usually sleeps all evening which prevents my partner and I from using our living room/office. We live in a small city apartment and its driving me insane. I've tried talking to sister about these issues but it usually turns into an argument or she gets overwhelmed and stays home anyway.
 

 I don't think I should be responsible for years of my parents enabling my sister, and that they should call me every time she needs something and expect me to help out because my sister is ""really unwell"". We are the same age, and we are both adults. I understand that this situation is complicated, but the fact is that our Mom called me to ask if my sister could stay. If my sister has directly reached out to me maybe it would have been a different story. I'm considering telling my parents they should get her an airbhb to stay in because I am not equipped to deal with all of her mental health issues. 
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 TLDR: Anxious sister is staying with me and its been difficult. I don't think I should be responsible for her because we are both adults and she should figure out some of these problems on her own."
"Hello Guys, 
 

 I think i have been having extreme anxiety hives for the past year. I have had them on/off for the past 4/5 years but i thought they might just be some sort of an allergy. But this year it has been absolutely debilitating to the point that it actually affecting my normal day to day life.
 

 In short, i would get extreme itching and inflamatory feelings on my skin ( whole body ) just like an allergic reaction/hives and some times it would leave red spots just like an allergy attack.
 

 I had went to multiple doctors to check for allergies but found nothing of mention, just some very very minor allergies to Dust and pollen, nothing that should be causing this extreme inflamation and itchiness.
 

 I honestly dunt know what to do, but at this point i am 100% sure that it has something to do with ny anxiety/depression as i immediatley get it whenever i feel anxious/nervous/down.
 

 Does anyone else suffer from this? Anything to do or any specific medications to take other than the generic anxiety/depression medication? 
 

 For reference i am 25 yrs male.
 

 Thanks in advance."

"Hi All, 
 

 I (26M) love my Dad (56) to bits and we have a fantastic relationship. Lately though, he has been triggered (rightfully so) by an intimidating neighbourhood bully. This has caused his anxiety to spike the highest I have ever seen it. 
 

 His psychologist recommended he speaks with a psychiatrist about getting on medication to manage the anxiety, but he doesn't want to (I respect his decision either way).
 

 Sometimes I am finding him incredibly difficult to communicate with about simple matters. I really want to respect his boundaries and I always try to be courteous, but sometimes when his anxiety gets the better of him, he can't think straight (totally understandable). It is starting to become very tiring.
 

 Do you have any advice on how I can learn to more effectively support/communicate with him when he is being a little difficult? 
 

 I am considering speaking with my psychologist and I also would like to know if there's any books or other resources that may help improve our relationship during the difficult times. 
 

 

 Many thanks everyone :)"
"To give a bit of context, I’m 27F married to a 29M. He’s usually really healthy other than some mental health anxiety and depression issues. About two years ago my husband lost consciousness on Easter Sunday during dinner. He was out for probably 5 minutes and when he came to he threw up on my brothers carpet. We called 911 to have him taken to the hospital. After all his tests they told us he had a swallow-syncope associated with a cold beverage. This means if he drinks beverages that are too cold or if he drinks cold beverages too quick he’ll lose consciousness for a few moments. I was in the bathroom getting ready for bed brushing my teeth and I heard a thud from my living room. My husband is on the ground face down and he isn’t responding to anything I saw. I went and got a cup of water to pour on his face to wake him up. My poor guy fell out of his desk chair and his his head on the bottom of the kitchen table. I’m massively worried about him and I’m not sure which direction to go to make sure he’s healthy."
Is it right to blame your parents for how you turned out??
"The past two plus years (and counting) have been really tough for me.
 

 I (27 M) graduated college at the tale end of 2017, and ended up moving right back in with my parents, since I was really depressed and isolated my final semester after being fed up with living in file cabinet-like dorm rooms for too long, as well as some other issues. I had been working at an indie movie theater near my house for the summers and winter breaks in between college, and had some really great relationships with my coworkers there. I stayed working there until a little over a year after I graduated, mostly because I needed the emotional attachment of being with my peer friends who I felt connected with, who had really helped me personally grow over the time that I worked there. As a neurodiverse person, this was very meaningful since making and maintaining friendships has always been a struggle of mine. By the time March of 2020 rolled around, I was mostly on my way out of the theatre, just covering a shift or two maybe once a month.
 

 In the early months of the pandemic, all of my friends were on Facebook, and it seemed like everybody was on the same page, doing what we could to help each other live through an uncertain time.
 

 In the time since, the theatre has reopened, but despite it’s fancy looking renovations, the few times I’ve gone into the building it feels somewhat like a fractured shell of its former self.
 

 One of my closest friends from the theatre sent me an angry, out-of-nowhere text message last fall saying that we don’t need to be in each others lives anymore, she felt drained whenever we hang out, and to not contact her anymore. That one still hurts.
 

 I don’t believe the pandemic is “over” and even if it ever is, there’s so much damage that’s been done beyond the 1 million+ deaths in America. I’ve been trying to keep my spirits as high as I can throughout the past two years by doing things that I’m comfortable with doing alone like birdwatching, hiking, cooking, watching great TV shows.
 

 I picked up a new retail job recently but it feels like yet another simple gig that I’m overqualified for. I haven’t made much progress since I finished college in whatever “career” that I’m supposed to have, mostly just bopping from one customer service job to another.
 

 I try my best to do things I enjoy, but it all feels a bit empty if I don’t have my friends anymore to spend time with, whether I was close or just casual with them, and I have no idea if I’ll ever see some of them again"

"Hi everyone ,
 

 29 F here , I\`m wrinting this post because i\`m seeking a little advice on how to manage my health anxiety that have worsend over last week ( my therapist is o vacantion and will return in September ) . A little context , when a was a kid and in my teenage years i never worry about health and etc , but in the last 2 years I shown signs of health anxiety , because about 2 years i randomly discovered 3 nodules on my thyroid Tirads 3 ( the doctor said that is a very small chance that in years will end up cancerous) , but than my mind began to wonder on WHAT IF , and instead of trust my endo i started google and was the stupid thing ever ..... Note : my husband in that period had also panick attacks also from health anxiety , but he i dont know how , but managed it , and till this day he is fine .
 

 Sincerely , i dont know how to stop google , to watch youtube vids with people with the same problem , i work from home now and sitting alone at home is not good for me because i end up in this rabbit hole of searching instead of going for a walk , do some yoga or meditation or play SIMS ( is my safe zone) . Plus my one year check-up is in november and I\`m already freaking out about the US and the nodules .
 

 Any little advice is very appreciated! Thanks ."
"I (27f) was bought up in a very anxious household with my mum being very shy and anxious too. This rubbed off on me and i was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder at age 9. 
 

 I’ve always been shy and I think if my mum had bought me up to have more confidence I could have been a very different person. Anyway I have never been a dancer. Not even as a child when musical statues was played. I come from a very large family and there have been lots of weddings throughout my lifetime but I have never danced at any or them. I used to sit at a table and socialise with other family members most of the time. 
 

 I’ve only been clubbing 4 times and hated it each time.
 

 Anyway my husbands family have always been so loud (we are Greek Cypriot) and very into dancing and music. My anxiety has worsened since being around them in the last 10 years. 2 of his cousins are getting married in the next 4 weeks and I am extremely anxious. It’s the first time I’ve attended a wedding that’s not in my family, and they are all dancers and I’m scared I won’t have anyone to sit and talk to. I’m going to feel awkward sat with my husband whilst most guests are dancing all night. 
 

 I usually just avoid these situations because they are just not for me. I didn’t go to both hen parties because they were all alcohol and party based. 
 

 I’ve never met anyone who feels this way. Can anyone else relate and do you have any advice for me?
 

 Thank you :)"

"Hi everyone! Im 29F and have history of anxiety, panic disorder, ocd and severe body dysmorphia, and depression. I've been seeing my therapist once a week for almost 3 years now (took about 9 months off in the middle due to lack of health insurance) I've recently started a new course of zoloft (on it about 8 weeks now) and am not doing PERFECT in life but I do feel that I have generally improved as a person over the last few years. I am not afraid of my anxiety/panic anymore and can talk myself down from a panic attack. I truly do believe I ended up here with all my combinations of therapy, books, mindfulness practices, and finally the low dose of zoloft just for that extra helping hand. Yesterday, my therapist stated she could tell I have been ""doing much better"" and she suggested that maybe it's time for me to reduce the frequency of my sessions. She said we could move to every other week, or even just move to an ""as needed basis"" where I could essentially text her if I needed and she would let me know of any open spots she had for a certain week. 
 

 My question is, has anyone here basically ""graduated"" from therapy? I am wondering if there's a certain way to tell if I'm ready to move to this next part of my life without it? I feel I mostly have the tools I need to work through things by myself, but I'm just feeling a little nervous about stopping therapy since its been a weekly part of my life for a while now. It also feels weird to me that maybe the medication really was just that last missing piece. I know some people just really do need medication, but I guess I was trying to convince myself I could do without (definitely glad i gave it a shot!) Just looking for some shared experiences from anyone who has the time, thanks in advance :)"
"Hi everyone. I'll (F28) be seeing a psychiatrist soon for my generalized anxiety + panic disorder and wanted opinions from those who have taken or currently taking Buspirone? I used to take antidepressants and antipsychotics for clinical depression about two years ago and had alot of unwanted side effects, so I'm avoiding the SSRIs route as much as possible. 
 

 I'm not taking any medication at the moment, except for the occasional Xanax when my anxiety levels spiral out of control. 
 

 How has your experience been with Buspirone?"
"All anxiety sucks, but man this health anxiety is really getting to me lately. It was has since i was about 11 but I’m super sleep deprived from dealing with a sick toddler last week and I think the lack of sleep is making it worse. I’m trying to keep it together for my sons sake but it’s so hard 😭"
"As the title reads, I am 25 years old. I have never had a strong memory and I suffer from ADHD. Lately it seems as though my memory is becoming progressively worse. I have a terrible time learning people's names but worse than that I am sometimes forgetting people's names who I've known for a long time. i have been to my family doctor, psychologist, psychiatrist and now seeing an endocrinologist. I have been trying for months to see a neurologist but it's a struggle due to insurance. I previously saw a neurologist for coldness and tingling in my hands but I was able to fix this with supplementation of magnesium (I take Adderall which depleted magnesium). I'm hoping I can get some ideas or feedback from others who have similar situation\ experience. 
 

 

 I first noticed it was my memory that had some issues when I started taking Adderall to treat ADHD. I was finally able to focus but I noticed I was struggling to recall things I studied. I began using notes and other tricks and tips from Google but my memory has gotten worse. I now struggle with mere sentences; I will forget what I was going to say, forget simple words or even sometimes say the complete wrong word."
"Hellom yesterday I discovered a little tiny ball on the back of my head, and it hurts when Iook up or touch it. Hurts like if it was a pimple, but it has no color, no mark, anything. It looks just like normal skin, but it's a tiny ball underneath. Should I be worried? Anyone has any experience with this?"
"(Possible trigger warning- talks about SH) 
 

 I’ve always had anxiety- like for as long as I can remember. I remember playing outside as a kid, and being afraid that every gust of wind would turn into a tornado and that every plane would fall from the sky on me. No exaggeration. I even thought at night that my parents would kill me, despite the fact they were wonderful parents and I had a very normal easy childhood (except for the anxiety). 
 

 Anyway, there’s no wonder that this much anxiety had physical effects on me. I remember being in early elementary school, so probably somewhere between the ages of 7-10 years old, and having an anxious habit of pulling my hair out. Not clump fulls at a time, but a few strands at a time. This resulted in the formation of a very noticeable and embarrassing bald spot. 
 

 My parents didn’t think about anxiety as a thing. They didn’t talk about it. They took me to my doctor, and instead of sending me to counseling or something healthy, my doctor gave me what I see now to be an unhealthy coping mechanism to stop me from pulling out my hair. I say coping mechanism, although I’m not fully sure that that’s the word to use. 
 

 She told me to start wearing a rubber band around my wrist, and every time I start to pull out any hair, I needed to pull it and let it snap on my wrist so the pain would remind me to not pull out my hair. I remember doing this constantly. I put all my effort into it, because I really wanted to save my hair. I would be walking around with welts all over my wrists where I’d snapped the rubber. But hey, my bald spot disappeared and I kept my hair. 
 

 Looking back, this just doesn’t feel right. I feel like it was conditioning me to hurt myself as an outlet, which I did numerous occasions after that, during my darkest times. 
 

 I hate that this was my experience and hope that no other kid was offered this as a treatment."
"I’m 26M and since beginning my sexual career (19), I’ve never not overthought every sexual encounter I’ve had. Whether it’s full sex or just sexual activities, I spend the entire time trying to last longer, what I look like, what I’m doing, how it’s affecting my partner, and overall wishing it were over. I’ve never been fully enjoying myself like a lot of others seem to be able to do. 
 

 I’ll be very into my partner, and have sexual urges and want to act on them, but the thought of doing it is a lot more enjoyable than actual having to. I feel like I’m failing in regards to my sex life because I can’t be fully present and enjoy it the way I feel I should. I don’t know what to do anymore. Luckily, my boyfriend is very patient and understanding, but I worry about my future sexually and want to be able to enjoy it. 
 

 Has anybody else experienced this? Any work arounds or anything to help myself not be experiencing so much inner turmoil? 
 

 Thank you"

"Wasn't really sure where to post this. I was working on a mini painting today and I started panicking because it felt like my hand was almost...numb. like it suddenly just felt weird. I'm really anxious about it and google is making it worse. If anyone has any insight or advice, I'd appreciate it."
"I (26f) hadn't used the vets for a few months, then last night, my cat had an out of hours emergency appointment, and it was a different vet (f30+) than I was used to, waiting for me at the door. My cat had had a stroke, and all she could do was give a steroid injection and ask me to come back tomorrow. 
 I was actually already going back the next day, for an apt with my other cat, and since my sick cat almost completey recovered overnight, I just went in for the apt with the other cat. 
 The vet (f30+) that I was used to seeing was there this time, and she asked about the sick cat, and I was like ""oh so you know? Yeah, she's better etc"" then a little later, I asked her ""so the vet I saw last night said I could get some tablets to help my sick cat?"" And goes ""yeah, that was me"" .....
 WHAT! How did my brain not see they were the same person?! I remember thinking, oh, different vet, but she looks like the other one, maybe they're related. 
 I feel so awkward and embarrassed that it's even possible for my brain to do this, but also, do you think I've accidentally insulted her? Like, pointing out that she looks like a WHOLE OTHER PERSON without her makeup and vet scrubs on? I feel really bad. 
 Like my SA is rooted in trying to fit in, but also, not causing pain to others cause I know how pain feels, so I hate accidentally insulting people, and I hate that this happened and all I could say was sorry. Like, she's a woman, who's a vet and owns her own vet office, and has a young baby, like, you want to be building someone like that up, you know? Not putting them down.
 Has this ever happened to you guys? Or been the recipient?"
"Nothing in the head simply anxious, tense, full of adrenaline throughout the day with no thought in mind. I try to engage a thought to my feelings to then solve the thought but cant quite match it. My mind running wild when it happens. What does your therapist say?
 Is being mindful the best option. I simply want to have some control over this constant feeling. 
 I am aware of situations and thoughts that provoke anxiety i use CBT and helps a lot. But its harder when this rush of random anxiety just strikes sometimes for weeks at a time. Why?"

It seems to be all I can think about, but I just can’t seem to figure out where to start. I don’t feel passionate about jobs, maybe animals but that is it. I have sat down with multiple people trying to figure out what direction to head but nothing seems to click with me. Even with men, I try and fail all the time.

"I'm 29m and recently took over the family business. An old fat farmer guy who's done business with my grandpa for years comes in today and completely disrespects me the whole time.
 

 Calls me kid several times before asking whats your name? Dufus? Continues to give me shit about the price of the job and how much I must have paid for the part and that I'm 29 so I don't know shit.
 

 I know from my grandpa this is just how he is and he's just giving me shit but it's not fucking funny. It was flat out disrespect and obviosuly what he actually thought of me. I just stood there awkwardly not knowing what to say. Boiling up like a steam pot inside about ready to explode on him. But I just took it.
 

 The anxiety levels are skyrocketed right now I'm just going through scenarios in my head of what I could have said to the old bastard. Fuck that guy if he comes back I'm telling him either be more respectful or go elsewhere. If I have balls that day atleast."
"Hi all! 
 I (27f) have been dating my boyfriend (28m) for approximately 6 months. We get along extremely well, we have shared interests and we challenge each other to learn and experience new things. He is really everything I could have hoped for.
 

 Approximately 4 years ago I was in a relationship with a person (24m) for about 1.5 years. It was the most traumatic thing I have ever experienced. He was a closet alcoholic, and I didn’t find this out until around 6 months into our relationship. His parents were lovely but they were happy to hand him and his problems off to me when we started dating, so I became more like a parent to him than anything. I checked his house, my house and his car daily for bottles, cans etc and I had access to his bank account where I saw multiple transactions at the liquor store per day. He had a breathalyzer in his car, so I would often have to go searching for him and find him passed out in the drivers seat of his car in a random parking lot with an empty bottle of vodka or beers. Along with the drinking was extremely good at lying. He lied about everything. You could sit in a glass dome outside with him fully noting that the sky is blue and he would scream at you in your face that the sky is purple until you believed him. He cheated on me with multiple girls (often bringing them back to my parents house during the day when nobody was home). One girl began following me around town and would come up to me and say extremely mean and hurtful things. He was physically abusive and did things like broke my car windshield, broke the knob off the door in my room and would push me into things like car side mirrors/poles etc so I would get hurt. He would also corner me and punch the wall around my head, or slam into me while I was in the corner. He smashed multiple phones I owned. Eventually I found the strength to walk away, but the damage had been done. 
 

 I believe I have severe PTSD from this relationship. I’m in therapy and have been for some time, but I just transitioned to a new therapist that I believe will be more helpful to me, as my old therapist was mostly just talk therapy. I’m also on 10mg of trintellex. Lately I have been in trauma and extremely anxious to the point of physically shaking, crying, panicking etc. My current boyfriend is very supportive but he is at the end of his rope. He is extremely stressed out as I seek reassurance multiple times a day, call him crying all the time, have heart to hearts with him 2-3 times a week and generally act like an anxious mess. I understand why he feels at a loss and anxious himself over this. 
 

 I am really hoping to gain some insight into self soothing techniques, ways to not forebode joy, ways to stay present and in the moment or any other tips to deal with this level of anxiety. I really want this for myself and so that my relationship can survive this period of anxiety. Thanks everyone! 
 

 TLDR: I need tips on anxiety after surviving a traumatic relationship."
"**TL;DR -** My fiancé told me to ""grow up"" and ""get over"" my lifelong, chronic anxiety. Did I overreact/act too rashly by breaking up with him?  
 

 **Context:**
 

 There's going to be a decent amount I won't mention because its simply too much to write coherently, or I forgot to mention it. I don't know where to post this kind of thing, and hope that this community could help me see past my anxiety demons to the truth.
 

 For some background, **I'm a 27F with ADHD, lifelong chronic anxiety, and intermittent depression.** *My (now ex-) fiancé is a 29M on the Autistic spectrum with some social anxiety and anger control problems that he is working on in therapy.* He also has a problem with holding onto grudges/events and hyperfocusing on the negativity of life/his day. We were together for 4+ years (not consecutively) and had spent the past two years of our relationship doing long distance (over 700 miles/1126 km) because of my schooling.  
 

 I just graduated college (FINALLY) and moved in with him in mid-May, while looking for a job and planning a wedding. Because I moved back to my home-state after 3+ years, I needed to form a whole new network for medical care as my previous provider was not able to accept ""new"" patients. To save money while making sure I didn't screw up my system completely (because the soonest appointment I could get would land 2.5 mo after I'd run out of anxiety medication), I did something....**stupid.** *I halved my anxiety medication daily dosage.* ((I know, I know, I really should have planned better. But I did try to get as much as I could before moving states, and ended up not being able to pick up the prescription because I was no longer a student.))  
 

 I have been taking this medication (Sertraline) for over ten years though (the same dosage for 5), and I did genuinely feel happier than I had in a very long time when I wasn't stressed out of my mind. On top of this, I only took my ADHD meds (short-acting) when needed, *and* got my IUD replaced a month before I moved in with him.  
 

 So...you could say my brain (and body) chemistry was a bit wacky for a while. 
 

 I do remember telling him about my anxiety about moving in, and how the stress from all the things going on in our lives would impact my ""day-to-day"" behavior for a while until everything settled down. He seemed to understand.  That understanding went away one morning, and we had a major fight. It ended with me screaming at the top of my lungs for him to get away from me, and me speeding off in my car, because I was so mad at him.  We talked it out though, both apologized, and came to a new understanding (while reminding each other of what we wanted the other to do when things get heated). 
 

 Fast-forward to the past three weeks, where everything started going downhill for me. We found our dream venue but were nervous about the pricetag associated with it. I went into overdrive on the budget, figuring out how we could keep it under our maximum price point --- and succeeded! After all this work, though, it only took one conversation with his mom for him to completely turn around and say that there was no way I was right about the budget. That it would be 3x more than I said simply because his mom said so, even though neither of them had asked (or listened to me talk about!) the budget and how we could make it work.  They ganged up on me, I snapped, and had a major meltdown. 
 

 Five days later, I was still very high-strung and anxious from the event, but also stressed (and busy) because of the training I've been doing for a new job (squishing 1-2 years of medical school into the span of 2 weeks).  He had made a mess with late-night cooking for himself and asked me to clean it up while he was at work. I agreed, not really realizing how bad it was. I was able to do most of it before my *I-know-it's-weird-but-its-real-I-swear* phobia of doing really dirty dishes that (1) I was not responsible for, or (2) I don't know where its been.  Its something I've dealt with since my grandfather died in middle school, and have almost gotten over with the help of therapy, dish gloves, and sponge wands.  
 

 *Anyway,* he came home that night to see half the dishes weren't done. We got into a minor disagreement about it - no voices were raised but it was *very tense.* He said he was more upset that I agreed to do something I ""wasn't or didn't want to do"", but that was not the case. I tried to explain it to him, it wasn't getting through to him, so I repeated my apology before letting him rail on me so he'd let it go.  
 

 Last Saturday, we were supposed to go to a venue for a tour. On the way there, he told me he thought we should postpone the wedding for *a while*, and that we needed to make couples counseling a regular thing because ""he didn't know me anymore.""  I asked why he didn't tell me the night before -- I was gone 6am - 9pm Friday because of training and work-related tasks -- as this was really inconvenient. *I could have planned on spending that time* in the car, the time we'd spend at the venue, and driving home, *on studying so I could pass training and lock down the job.*  Furthermore, it seems rude to just cancel on someone last minute (which we were forced to do anyway). He didn't see any of this as a problem...which began our longest argument yet. 
 

 I agreed with him when it came to things I knew I did wrong, things I said out of anger or anxiety that I had taken back and profusely apologized for.... Events that happened over a year ago that he was still bringing up, despite resolving them in counseling. He was citing several of these incidents when I asked him why he thought we needed counseling. Then he cited the most recent incidents when I asked what made him think he didn't know me anymore. The dishes thing two nights prior, and the two big anxiety meltdowns/spirals I had. **I couldn't believe what I was hearing from the man who would have constant outbursts of rage, negativity spirals, and two hour long rants, which I had helped and supported him through** ***every time*** **without questioning** ***him, or us.***  
 

 In all the time we were together, I only had severe meltdowns like these no more than 9 times. Out of these 9, only the two above directly involved him, *and were started because of his own behavior and my unmedicated rashness.*  
 

 I asked him what he wanted me to do with my anxiety and stress, if I should just snap my fingers and make it go away. To my surprise, he said ""Yeah, actually. You need to grow up and get the fuck over it."" I asked what he meant by ""it"", if he meant the dish-thing, or all of my anxiety. He said everything.  
 

 I was in tears afterwards and stormed out of the room. I called my mom and a friend for advice before jumping straight into moving my most important stuff into boxes and a suitcase, and told him I was done. I was leaving, because what he said hurt and was not okay. I've been with my mom ever since, and am still completely heartbroken (and potentially losing the job I was training so much for.)
 

 **A part of me wonders if I overreacted, if he would have changed his mind, if I made a mistake by breaking up with the man who loved me. Did I break up with the only person who would ever romantically love me? Did he love me, or did he love the ""perfected"" version of me that lived in his head?** 
 

 I know that most of this is my anxiety demon, but I still can't see past it towards reason. So I need to know if I overreacted, if I made a huge mistake, or if I was making at least a bit of sense....? **I know y'all can't truly know everything without being there yourselves, but I hope this context gives you enough of an idea to give me an honest answer.**

 Yes, I'm currently finding a new therapist too, but most are not taking new patients.  
 

 Thanks, and sorry, and thanks."
"I had a conversation with my therapist about this and there are some of the techniques she thought would be helpful - breathwork, reading words of affirmation and repeating to yourself and similar. What else would you recommend? I am thinking of creating a note to myself to work through this when and if a situation arises."
"So, I’ve been getting this back ache right in the middle of my back, basically a mix of upper lumbar and lower thoracic (just slap bang in the middle of my back on the spinal area, more so the right). It’s an ache that tends to hurt when I bend over, reach out for certain things across my desk and twist in certain ways. It just feels so tight and stiff almost. Paracetamol and ibuprofen don’t work for it and I feel like the stresses my physio gave me just aren’t working that area of my back. I’m only on my 3rd day of these stretches. 
 

 I suffer from health anxiety bad so I started thinking about it too much and googling. Long story short I’ve convinced myself I have a spinal tumour or something cancer related so now I’m on a spiral, just wondered if anyone else has had this pain? 
 

 I had bloods not long ago, like a FBC and they even checked my pancreas and liver functions etc and all that came back normal."
"Hi, 29M from the Netherlands. I was diagnosed with GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder) 5 years ago. I’ve been in therapy (cognitive behavorial therapy) on and off. Since my last therapy session a year ago I’ve been doing quite well. But I still have bouts of mild to severe anxiety now and then - and I’m just not sure where to go from here and what kind of help to look for.
 

 I feel like my anxiety has a pretty strong control over my life, but not in an extreme and disrupting way. It’s mostly overthinking, ruminating (A LOT), catastrophising, behaving insecurely and having mild anxiety attacks (not the full blown panic kind of attacks). My last therapist considered me as high functioning, but I feel like that label dismisses the effects I feel due to my anxiety. I’ve also never had medication because of my capacity to handle my anxiety well. (I go to work each day, work out, have an OK social life and have no real troubles other than being constantly insecure and worrying about everything).
 

 I’ve been doing meditation and mindfulness and that helps a tremendous deal, but I feel like mindfulness is more of a lifestyle/philosophy and that it’s quite difficult to maintain the mindset that mindfulness requires.
 

 Could anyone suggest me what to do? What avenue to explore? I’m not in therapy now and I don’t use meds. Just looking for friendly advice. :)"
Can anxiety cause breathing issues all day? 😭 since I laid down last night in bed I have felt like my chest/lungs are super tight and I can’t breathe but they are fine when I stand up. My heart has been pounding too and my resting today is up 20 bpm than normal. I went on Google and now I’m convinced I have heart failure at 25 years old 😭 When I take a deep breathe I feel a feeling in my throat that makes me what to cough too.

"Trigger Warning: Sexual Assault/Rape. Child Abuse.
 

 This has been the hardest year of my life so far, and I'd like to apologize ahead of time for the extremely lengthy post. I (28f) moved in with my parents a year ago, because I no longer felt safe in my apartment. Plus, I need to save up for a car. I'm a single teacher with nearly $900 in student loan payments a month. My lowest grade in college was a ""C"" I received in Personal Finance. I'm trying my best to adult. Anyhow... Last summer, I was raped in my apartment by a stranger. I've been in a few abusive relationships, but this broke me. I can barely leave the house, except for work.
 

 I ended up moving home a couple days before the first day of school, which made the beginning of the school year tough. It didn't help that my commute went from 15 minutes to 1 hour. This past school year seemed like a blur, and I felt like a horrible teacher all the time. One of my students, who was disenrolled in December due to poor attendance, lost a sibling to neglect a couple months following her disenrollment. The mother had left the home, and the youngest of the 3 babies (1yo) died from eating heroin for the second time in a few months. Before school one day, our school resource officer and the elementary building social worker came to my classroom to ask if I was \_\_\_\_\_\_\_'s teacher. I explained that they were no longer in my class, and they informed me one of the 3 children (my student was the oldest, they had just turned 5) had passed the night before. I lost it. I had advocated to keep the student in my class, because I knew they needed to be in school. My student loved school and was learning for what seemed like the first time. Our special services team had finally started a plan to get the student help with speech services and occupational therapy. I was devastated when my program disenrolled them, so finding out what happened to the little sibling was heartbreaking. I felt awful, because I wish I could've been keeping an eye out for the kids. Make a report if I needed to. Do something. I made either 36 or 38 DCS reports this school year. WAY more than I normally make in a year. All of the students in my class are living in low-income households, because of the type of funding my classroom is under. I'm used to making DCS reports, but not 36/38 in one year. Not all of the reports were for the same situations/families, but they were all emotionally draining. Binge eating and crashing in my bed as soon as I got home became a regular thing.
 

 I'm trying to be positive about the upcoming school year, but I'm struggling. I really want to get back to being the best teacher I can be. I had a really poor end of year evaluation this year. The new principle and AP came 18 minutes late and scored me poorly for not showing them enough. I explained that we had decided on a time (I was able to find the email and show them), and they didn't come at the time. They had thought it was 15 minutes later than planned. I teach 2 half day sessions, so our day goes by quick. It's kind of important to come at the scheduled time, because my 30 minute evaluation window was planned for them to see everything they needed before we transition to the next thing (which was specials in this case). They also docked me lots of points for using the word ""foundations"" instead of ""standards"" on my lesson plans, even though preschool doesn't have standards. We have foundations. They didn't know it was the same thing, and they didn't bother to click on the link in my lesson plans to the website with foundations. That would've cleared things up. After we talked, they gave me a MUCH better score. A score I'm used to seeing. The whole situation is making me dread next year's evaluation.
 

 My mom is Korean, and she doesn't believe in mental health. I was diagnosed with GAD in college, and I've been medicated since. I don't believe the meds contributed to my weight gain after college, but I did gain about 40 pounds following college graduation. Two years ago, I had worked really hard and lost 30 pounds! This year, I've gained it all back. My mom never hesitates to comment negatively on my weight. I think it's hard for her to see me like this, because I grew up being skinny. She paid for the enrollment fee and first 2 months at a gym, and now she seems to feel comfortable ridiculing me even more. I can barely leave my bedroom. I don't feel like I can go to a gym right now.
 

 My betta fish got sick when we lost power a few weeks ago from a thunderstorm, and I immediately went out to buy supplies to treat her. I tried 2 weeks of treatment, and then I posted to reddit a couple days ago asking for help. Nobody responded, and that made me feel really uneasy. My anxiety was through the roof. I'm guessing my post was too wordy (me? no...), or I maybe didn't word it all correctly? Maybe I came off like a b\*tch. I'm not sure. It's been hard seeing other posts in the thread (specifically ones where users are asking for help/advice) get answers. My betta girl means a lot to me. I got her about half a year before I was assaulted, and her tank was in the bedroom where it happened. I'm emotionally attached to this fish, so it felt personal when I didn't get any advice. I know I'm probably sounding like a b\*tch right now. I'm not upset with redditors. I'm just anxious about the situation.
 

 The reason I felt the need to come on and vent is because today, I found out that my only long-term ex (also my most recent ex) has been dating someone since March. They're either already living together, or they're going to be living together soon. I broke up with him 3 years ago, because we saw our futures differently. It was hard seeing him happy. I can't help but feel like my life turned out this way as a result of me leaving him. My happiest (and fattest lol) memories are from when I was with him. I made sh\*t choices after I left him, and then the hardest year of my life happened.
 

 Thanks if you read my sloppy vent. Thanks if you didn't. You're welcome for deleting several paragraphs lol. Fuck anxiety.
 

 Edit: Included a trigger warning for child abuse. Also, I know this is a venting type of post, but I would love any advice or kind words you have. This was a hard post to write, and a some of it is stuff that I've not shared with anyone."
"So I have been raised in an Indian family and my parents were extremely poor growing up. They put a lot of pressure on me to excel in academics. 
 

 I was told that I'm would be doomed that if I wasn't the best and had also suffered beating, yelling and emotional abuse just due to academics.
 

 I was always anxious as a kid, teen, in early 20s to till date (I'm 27 now).

"Hi 25F here! 
 I have had severe social anxiety since grade school. It’s gotten better over the years with the help of my wonderful therapist. I’ve had a few anxiety attacks that I think have been caused by major changes in my life (change is one of my biggest struggles). I left my job of four years in retail to become an office manager at a construction company, I started dating a past boyfriend and my family isn’t too keen on it (there’s a 19 year gap) and mostly don’t speak to me anymore. I just recently moved in with my boyfriend in June and it’s a bit different for I have lived with my parents for the last 24 years due to mostly my anxiety. 
 

 I need advice on how to communicate with him when I’m feeling an attack coming on and what to do in the current situation. There’s only two other people who I know thoroughly understands what to do and that’s my mom and my therapist. My past relationship of two years did not accept my anxiety and all the things that come with it positively and I automatically assume T will be negative towards it too. It’s hard to explain to someone who isn’t familiar with living with someone who has learning disorders, anxiety disorders and is on the spectrum, so I try to mask until I can’t anymore and it causes a slight strain to our relationship as a whole. Sorry if some sentences do not make sense, my brain is tired."
"Hi all, as the title reads: I'm 27(m) and can't drive. It's a thing thats bothered me a lot lately. I do want to drive, I just get so much anxiety over it.
 

 The anxiety came from two places really: Multiple car accidents, and my mom who died from cancer who loved driving.
 

 The accidents were pretty bad, and happened spread out from around 18-26. One of them resulted in 5 cars being tally wrecked, and another was with a drunk driver. Both times I was just a passenger, but they've affected me enough to where driving gives me anxiety. I get scared I might be the cause of an accident, or might get into one. Especially where I live in LA, constant traffic, bad drivers, everyday is an ""almost got into an accident"" type of day.
 

 It also gets me depressed. My mom LOVED driving. She was the first one in her family drive, and to get a car. It just reminds me of her sometimes. Before she died she taught me how to drive up the driveway of our house, and its a memory that comes up a lot when I try to learn to drive.
 

 Not driving has gotten in the way of me not doing a lot of things. Like I can't get to hard to reach places, or just coast the highway with friends, or be on time for work. My friends see me as lower than what I am since I can't drive. It's been coming up a lot and even as I tell them my arguments as to why its not totally a bad thing (like I save so much money) I'm reminded that I'm turning 30 in a few years and that my baby cousin I used to babysit is getting her permit soon. 
 

 Luckily, my job is hybrid with me going to the office only about once per week so not driving hasn't hindered me getting to work. But I do want to drive. I just don't know how to lower my anxiety about it. Does anyone have any advice on this? Has anyone started driving this late in life? 
 

 Thanks in advance!"
"Hi everyone. I'm 27 F and 240lbs. I don't even know where to start. 
 

 I used to be very active as a teen and in my early 20s. I went to Tae Kwon Do 6 days a week and even did indoor rock climbing after I quit TKD. I was very slim and didn't really eat much. 
 

 Fast forward to now and I am obese, out of shape, and exercising scares me. I'm afraid of passing out. I have minor heart issues (which will be fixed this Friday, hopefully. Going for an ablation). I have asthma so cardio has always been hard for me. 
 

 When I do try to exercise or even walk, I freak out when I can feel my heart beating fast. I've been working from home since COVID so I'm not really active at all. I did get a treadmill so that I can still walk without dealing with this intense Texas heat. But as soon as my heart hits 120-130 I stop because I panic. 
 

 I just feel lost. I want to lose weight and I want to be healthier. I just don't know where to start."

Sometimes I feel like it takes the whole fun out of my entire life. I think of horrible Sanrio’s when I go out and I can’t enjoy myself or have any fun. Even when I get really stressed out I start hyperventilating because idk what to do… need some advice on how to handle this…
"Does anyone else has this where stomach seems to burn constantly? Sometimes I get nauseous too. Im scared of cancer, obviously. I've been like this since last year, on and off . Not all the time, but days at a time every now and then, all day long, no matter what I eat. I can't go to a doctor. I'm exhausted and terrified."
"It's sad to say, but it's like I'm barely passionate about anything anymore. And it always seems like such a chore trying to get into something new. Not sure if it's like a Depression thing or if I'm just a low energy person, but it just makes me so frustrated. I don't really have a circle of friends at the moment, but I do have one best friend and my boyfriend. They do encourage me to try doing more things like reading or playing video games, which I do try doing occasionally, and then I always end up falling off and losing my enthusiasm for the thing. I used to love playing video games, learning new songs on the guitar, writing, or practicing singing, but it just seems so much more difficult these days. I also feel like it would help if I had more people with common interests to do things with, but that's also very difficult for me, especially now I'm 27F and it's hard making new friends as an adult and even harder when you get anxious in social situations. Anybody else have this dilemma, and if so, how do you cope with it?"
"Just posting to spread some love. I know how hard it is to go by every day, being frustrated with your inability to be social. The fear of acting regardless of how strong your desires are. It sucks when you want friends, receive a text or phone call, and avoid it out of fear of conversation. It sucks when you want to speak up, finally get the courage to do so and embarrass yourself. It’s sucks when you get invited out, actually follow through with it, only to hardly say a word, leaving a bad impression. 
 

 Just know that anytime you try you succeed. Why is that? Because you are strong. Being strong doesn’t mean you’re competent or confident, it means you fight in the face of adversity. Whenever you try, you’ve done a great job, even if it’s something as simple as leaving your home, it is a great accomplishment! You are battling your greatest fear, things won’t magically improve. When you take enough baby steps, you’ll eventually reach a mile. It may seem distant and daunting at first, but after many, countless steps you can make it, no you WILL make it. Be proud of your accomplishments, and may you have a blessed day :)"
"I am 26. I consider myself as an introvert and relatively timid guy. Nevertheless, I began to feel more and more comfortable in public events such as parties and birthdays. Making new friends was never easier to me than now. The problem is, sometimes I can't find the words to say or the people to talk to, which affects me. Of course, it might last just some minutes until somebody catches my eye but it's too late: my brain already started creating fake thoughts where I consider I don't belong there or no one would notice if I left.
 

 The curious thing is, I am perfectly aware that those are just temporary thoughts and the very next day will definitely be different, but it doesn't seem to be enough to get me rid from those feelings. Words stop coming out and I feel alone. Any recommendation?"
"28f and I'm starting to consider the idea of moving out of my mom's house to get into a different career field...but I'm scared. I would be moving to a new place with my fiance. Rent is a big commitment and its a whole other thing to worry about all the time. I would also have to learn a new area. 
 

 I assume this is normal, but how do you get the confidence to take the plunge?"
"I have GAD. Im not currently in therapy but ive been to several therapist before and has helped me ALOT CBT MEDITATION MEDICATION AND SUCH
 

 SO i have this issue that i want an answer to. I would love to take my question to a therapist but dont have access to one currently so would love your opinions.
 

 So i randomly started feeling anxious. In my room. The same routine as always. Room is cool and environment relaxed. Nothing threating has happened to me or family. But still feel anxious. Hands tingly chest tight you name it. Im aware of these sensation and im not afraid of heart attack not afraid of panick. Nothing (therapy helped).
 So i want to find the origin of this feeling so i start journaling and asking myself questions. I try to engage my feelings to a possible hidden thought but i cant find anytjing but anxiety and its sensations are still there.
 

 My question is. Is it really possible for the anxiety just to pop in for no reason at all? Should i just meditate and breath it away? What has your therapist said abojt free floating anxiety? 
 

 I obsess about the idea that every anxious feeling ABSOLUTELY has a thought and its always a thought. So i frutrate my self about not finding such thoughts.
 

 Please tell me im wrong lol jk give me your opinions. What does your therapist say? Thanks guys"

"My anxiety has always been the biggest secret of mine. I haven’t told about it to my parents either. Only a couple people know about it. 
  
 I met my friend after years of not seeing each other and I told her about my anxiety. We have been friends for 20 years. In the last few years I feel like my friend has changed and I don’t even want to be her friend anymore and that’s why I regret telling her."
"My (25f) bf (26m) and I have had a struggle lately because of communication lately. When he says that he’ll call me or gives me a certain time that he will call I’ll hold onto it and when it’s not met I get really anxious and question if we’re okay. 
 

 It’s an issue, and i see it’s started to put a bad strain on us. I just don’t know how I can counter act my anxiety. I tell myself everything is okay, he’s busy or he’s still sleeping. Which most cases he is sleeping or running late to work ( he works overnights) but if I don’t get a call like normally I get it in my head that we’re not okay. I’ll call him and then he here’s my voice knows something’s up but when he hears it’s the same issue it goes to shit.
 

 He’s told me that everything is okay but not in a soft way just more in a irritated way which makes me more anxious. I think at this point he’s kinda fed up with my anxiety and me not knowing that everything is okay he just needs space or some times he’s running late and the last thing he’s really thinking about is giving me a call… idk"
"As I said. That means I am not anyone's loved one or close to anyone. I am not able to share my problems with anyone (I need someone who can be physically present here). Unable to ask for help. When I do, no one wants to help because I am a stranger to them. Everyone tries to be distant. I am sorry to say, but it makes me hate everyone who just cares about their loved ones or their friends and not anyone else. Many of you may have someone whom you can share your pain with. But some don't. It makes me feel like I am not a part of this world and I don't deserve to live. I don't have any suicidal thoughts. It's just a feeling. I am even scared to post this. Though just going to hit ""post"". I don't know why I am going to post this. Or what I am going to get after posting it"
"For context, I (25F) have been doing a lot of self-development over the last year, which has included doing things out of my comfort zone as a way to combat my GAD that I was diagnosed with 10 years ago.
 

 Rewind to a few months back where a work friend of mine asks if I would be happy to house sit and look after her dog while she goes on holiday for two weeks during the summer holidays (we both work in education). Now my initial thought to this was that I didn’t really want to do it. I didn’t want to be pinned down to someones house and someones dog. But part of me felt guilty at the thought of saying no. I didn’t have any plans going on during those first two weeks of the holidays so coming up with a reason to not do it felt like the easy option. I also felt that in the spirit of doing things out of my comfort zone it would be a good thing to do so….I agreed. I’d met the dog before and have my own dogs at home so don’t feel like a complete novice. And while the dog I’d be looking after is much more excitable than my small, lazy pups, I felt that it would be doable to look after her.
 

 So six days ago I came to my work friends house for the first time and was initially struck by how messy the house was. Not just messy but….dirty. It’s also a very small house that is incredibly dark but I decided to remain positive and told myself it wouldn’t be that bad. We went on a walk with the dog and everything seemed a-okay.
 

 Yesterday I go to my friend’s house and everything all of a sudden just hits me and I am in fight or flight mode. I am at a house that I don’t want to be in, with a dog that I don’t want to look after (so turns out this dog is a bit mental as she is a collie x sprocker), for two whole weeks. I ended up calling my Mum because I was in such a flap and not able to even think straight about what I should do. Together her and I have come up with a plan but I just feel so overwhelmed. The dog doesn’t have to be looked after constantly 24/7 so I’m leaving her at home on her own for a couple of hours so I can have a break at my own house, and tonight we are going to test out bringing her to my house and whether she gets along with my dogs so we can bring her here.
 

 It all sounds like the situation is near enough sorted and I’m lucky enough to have a Mum that is willing to help me when these situations happen, but I cannot shake the anxiety it’s created in me. Anxiety is very physical for me so I am completely off my food, my heart is POUNDING, I feel like I could cry at the drop of a hat and the thought of having to do anything with this dog on my own feels absolutely terrifying. I don’t really know why I’m putting this on here - maybe just for words of encouragement or advice idk. I just feel hugely incapable and like a failure tbh."
"So if you don't want any background story here is the case:
 

 What do I tell my boss when she will ask about my (likely upcoming) sick leave? It's due to anxiety which I haven't told her I suffer with because they have bad experience with employees with mental health issues. She just started her summer break and I am assistant manager while she is away, I am also in a resignation period so I feel like an asshole if I go on sick leave now but I am so stressed about my current situation that I am scared I will ""break"". 
 

 I'm not good at faking sick (like having flu and etc) 
 

 Background in detail 
 

 Mid June I got the news that I got a spot in a master course that is very competitive to get into, I had therefore assumed I wouldn't get in and forgot about the whole application (I don't have very good grades u see)
 

 So when I got the news it was ~ 1 month to the first day of uni and I needed to find a place to live and its 6h+ away. 
 

  I was already in a resignation period with my job when I got the news, except it didn't line up with the course dates so I had to stress to try get as many of my shifts swapped with someone else, which has only been partly successful.
 

 I also hadn't terminated(?) the housing contract I'm currently in, so I also have to potentially pay rent for 3 months together with the new apartment.
 

 I also have a 2nd job which is supposed to be my primary income (I decide the working hours) which I now need to neglect due to the other stuff coming up
 

 Sorry if this was messy but I'm so stressed about moving out in less than a month, working almost every day and therefore not being able to hurry up with emptying the apartment and mentally prepare for a master course while doing all of this and while suffering from anxiety, avpd and depression."
"I feel like I'm going through the worst phase of my life. I (29f) was raised by my father, my mom died in a brutal accident when I was 8. I got verbally and physically abused by my relatives when my father left me with them for a couple of years while he worked in a remote location. I got bullied in school for ""dressing different"" and having shorter hair. Got bullied in college for being a virgin who didn't drink. Then met and married a wonderful man. And now I have the worst set of in-laws you could imagine. My spouse decided to go no contact, and life hasn't been easy. He's depressed, so am I. Somedays it's difficult to get out of bed. Some days I wish I wasn't alive. I have had therapy in the past and I kind of have the tools to deal with some shit but rn I don't seem to have the energy to do so. I feel suffocated. Like there's just no end to the miseries. So here's my question: what keeps you going? What book, movie, song, podcast, quote etc has gotten you through your darkest hour? How you find the will to get up and tell yourself it gets better? That you can someday be happy?"
"I (29F) suffered with extreme social anxiety during my youth, to the point that I was essentially mute until high school. This had a huge impact on my friendships and prevented me from having a lot of the experiences that most cherish most in life…. Middle school friendships, sleepovers, girl chats, high school parties, and uni nights going out are things that I have missed out on and will never have the chance to experience again. 
 

 Thanks to a lot of hard work, I have overcome a huge chunk of my social anxiety to the point that many people would never guess that it is something that i suffer with. I have also had a significant “glow up” and get treated a lot differently now by the opposite sex.
 

 The problem… I am now realizing just how much I lost out on, which I can never get back. I am absolutely gutted.
 

 I thought I at least had a close relationship with my sister (25F) since we routinely have deep talks, but I recently realized that she has a much different and more “fun” relationship with her high school friends because they experienced a lot of wild and formative things together. She has told me that it’s too late for us to grow that aspect of our relationship since that is something that develops early in life. She is also getting married and is in a completely different phase of life now. This realization also shook me.
 

 At this point, I am not sure how to move on. I feel very alone and like I don’t have anyone who truly sees me for me and loves me entirely. 
 

 How do I come to terms with 
 

 1- The idea that I may never have the sort of relationship I crave with my friends or sister
 and;
 

 2- I will never be able to fully recreate the experiences I missed from my youth, which is a HUGE chunk of life I am missing
 

 Thanks for your help 😊"
"Hello, everyone! I was wondering if anyone dealing with acid reflux or stomach issues in general ever had blood in their spit, specially after waking up??
 I'm not talking about quite literally spitting out blood, but having some blood on the spit. I thought it was my gums but they're fine. I snore a lot, so my throat gets irritated when I sleep, but this has happened without having snored, according to my girlfriend. I'm worried it's some cancer going on somewhere in my throat or digestive system"
"A few months ago, I was working out and hurt my back a little. (I have a history of sciatica, a microdiscetomy and chronic pain/herniated discs).. I'm 25. Anyway - proceeding this and potentially along side other life stressors - my body, my entire body from my face to my feet were having nerve pain? Misfiring? Tingling? .. this induced insomnia as I was terrified of going back into an acute flare of sciatic pain, and panick attacks (according to a counsellor I saw). This went on for about 2 months. I had MRIs completed, bloods etc and they all came back clear. The doctor then suggested an antidepressant and also is used for neutopathic pain - it completely zonked me for days. I took myself off it, and magically... the nerve pain was gone. The doctor had mentioned as there was no physical cause, that it was all emotional/mental health driven. My question is - has anyone else ever had this?"
"Hey all, 25F here. I take 20 mg propranolol once in the morning for anxiety &amp; heartrate (I don't take it in the evenings because of the awful nightmares it gives me). I started it around a month and a half ago. One thing I noticed is that my veins are significantly more noticeable and more blue in color. 
 

 I'm very pale so they were already visible to a degree, but the color is much more prominent. They're not darker, just... blue-er. Lol. Particularly in my wrists, hands, feet and chest. I'm always hydrated and due to health anxiety I'm afraid to look up reasons for visible veins. Are visible veins a side effect of beta blockers? Or are veins suddenly becoming more prominent a normal thing? I've never taken them before and I've never had this happen to me before."
"So I’m doing a little bit of introspection and understanding about my issues and came to wonder if others are like my or have these issues to baring degrees. I find that many people who are SA are quite emotional yet I can’t say the same for me so I’d imagine there may be some subtle differences.
 

 Is communicating an issue for you? If you have someone talk to (SO, siblings, parents, whoever you can actually talk to) are you able to share you thoughts and feelings? I find that I can’t. I’m not able to communicate and that’s one major issue that I’m trying to work on."
"My car stopped running while I was on my way home from a grocery store. I was able to pull off the main road and to a safer location. Kinda. I’m off main roads, but I’m right around a corner. Other drivers are definitely annoyed with me. I called a towing service to pick me up. I’m scared. I’m nervous it’s going to be a man, and I’m not comfortable around men. I’m having a panic attack, and I’m afraid I won’t be able to speak. I have another 30 or so minutes to wait before they get to me.
 

 Edit: I made it home! Thank you for your kind words! They helped me through a very scary experience."
"Hello!
 

 I am currently having anxiety (wanting to tear up) in regards to my roommate/friend. I have had this type of anxiety previously with this situation and I just want suggestions or advice to help reduce it.
 

 Basically she's not doing good, is sad/depressed and doesn't want to talk about it. I think I've done all I can, make sure she has resources available if needed (eg. distress center line, offering to drive her anywhere if needed). 
 

 I had some catastrophizing assuming everything is my fault she has reassured me it's not and it's personal, but I still feel so helpless not being able to help someone especially someone who is not doing good that's so close physically. She is my first roommate apart from my common-law partner. 
 

 It's hard not to be anxious when someone around me is not doing good. 
 

 I also wanna reduce my anxiety to not add on to her stress/problems because she feels bad for making me worry. Which I have said not to be sorry, I just care."
"Just went to a gastroenterologist and he said my tonsils are inflamed and I have laringitis. He said that just by looking at my throat for a few seconds. 
 

 I don't think I ever had this, and I didn't suspect it either. It doesn't hurt, no fever, no cough.
 Is it bad? Is it dangerous if untreated? Apparently had it for about a month now. He gave me antibiotics for 3 days"
I am 26 F and am looking for anxiety support group? None of my family or friends deal with anxiety so I feel very alone having no one to talk to that understands. I’m hoping to find some people willing to talk and support each other through anxiety recovery.
"I hate when I have to go do things that trigger severe anxiety but god damn when it’s finally over or if said thing gets canceled the relief feels so good. Almost enough to be willing to do other things that would normally make me nervous but just not as nervous as the original thing.
 

 Granted it’s not enough to make me willing to put myself in that state often but at least it’s a nice little treat for when I have to deal with high stress 🤷‍♀️"
Curious what everyone does during their days off I tend to get anxious because I’m just so use to working. So when I have a day off all I do is sit on my phone or clean.
For the last few days my anxiety has been kinda high? Or so I think? Idk anymore. I’ve been overthinking my breathing to the point where I constantly have to take deep breaths.. like I am hungry for air? So it makes me anxious. And then I have been nauseous so idk. I thought it was the new protein bars I tried but I didn’t have one today and I’m still nauseous. Can anxiety make you constantly nauseous and hungry for air like that? 😭
"Now let me preface this by saying, ive had throat tightness before, ive had the globus sensation. But this is like on the outside of my throat. More like the front of my neck. 
 So im currently terrified its a thyroid issue or throat cancer of course. But its like when i swallow the outside of my throat gets tight and will “click” or crunch when i turn my head. My voice is fine. I can swallow and eat fine. But its really annoying and i was wondering if anyone else experienced this?? Its only on one side and is like a pulled muscle almost idk its freakking me out"
"(25M) I had a massive falling out with these friends at the beginning of the year and ever since then life has felt a bit weird. I’m quite new to Reddit but it has helped. I also have ASD should it help. Took the initiative to go separate after some harsh words were exchanged and BAM, Started a new Job. However because of some issues I started the job late meaning everyone got to know each other and bonded so when I joined everyone and already befriended and clicked up. The first month I cried at the staff drinks because I felt so left out…It’s coming to the last month I honestly thought I would have least made more friends or some connection but honestly there’s only one guy I can say I feel a connection with. I feel like all the guys are really quirky and funny and then I pull up. It's like they don’t know what to say to me or don't crack the same jokes they would to each other. I feel quite left out in a way. (It’s like a theatre job 6 months contact job)
 

 I suffer from big Fomo(Fear of Missing Out) so I go to every external event they have (even if I don’t like one of them) just to feel like I’m part of something and not left out. 
 

 Tbh I don’t know if what I’m saying is making sense I guess I just wanted to get it out of my head. I really wish I could get a group of close friends again or even just a good mate and not feel like this. 
 

 The one cool guy that I talk to at work when he tells me he goes to have drinks with friends I get jealous, I even ask him how do you have friends to do that with and idk I feel like I push people away he’s so cool but I’m scared I’m gonna lose him he’s like the only friend i really have there.
 

 You see all your friends going out on social media meeting up it’s even worse when you see all the people you know all meeting up. My fear is the people from my work will all meet up without me and it will truly solidify how I feel about it feeling included.
 

 Guess I’m just looking for advice and some friends."
"I (27F) have had a needle phobia since I was 2. At 2 years old I was diagnosed with double pneumonia and the nurse kept getting making me bleed. This only got worse as my parents didn’t really do much and I also had a stroke at 16 and a nurse struck a nerve in my right arm… 
 

 My phobia isn’t as intense as it was before and all I do when scared is cry/pull my arm away. I no longer get scared into flight or fight… I have now have a bigger problem. I recently accepted an offer to work in a medical center, but they wanna draw blood and test me for tuberculosis. I wasn’t told about it until I got there causing me to go into a panic attack where I’ve been crying on/off all day. 
 

 Would anyone have any suggestions on how to tackle the last stage of this phobia? I’ve done exposure therapy which did what it could, hypnosis did nothing, and I’ve tried some anti anxiety meds but it hasn’t done much."
"I'm a freelancer but have a couple of places where I work consistently, and my coworkers from one of those places planned for people to go out and have drinks. Against my better judgment, I decided to go with them. Before I'd even left the house I had reservations and knew that I felt off but I decided I was overreacting and I could just brute force my way through my anxiety. Turned out that's not how that works. I got there, spent five minutes outside freaking out, and then went and joined them. Lasted about an hour during which I largely talked about my anxiety when I talked at all and then hit my breaking point and stepped outside where I immediately burst into tears. I kept trying to use all the grounding techniques that I'd learned and kept hoping I'd calm down but it just wouldn't happen, I just felt worse and worse and worse. Ideally, I could have just gone home but I'd given a coworker my phone to hold so I wouldn't stress about another job. Because of that, I had to go back in, in full view of everyone and still in tears, ask for my phone, and essentially run out. This is exactly why I usually have a rule that I don't hang out with coworkers. I can never undo that that happened. For the rest of the time that I work there, everyone will know about that side of me. I'm 28 and I sort of figured at some point this shit would become less debilitating and I could just live my life like a regular person but it's extremely evident that that's not gonna happen. And then to add to the fun, I had to take public transit home (while still crying) and a well-meaning person tried to ask if I was okay. I basically yelled at him to please not talk to me and ran away. I feel horrible because he clearly meant well but I just couldn't be around people. I'm just so frustrated. I really didn't think this would still be such a big issue in my life in my mid-twenties, and I guess it's a disappointment. And in less than 24 hours I have another shift working with them and will have to face everyone."
"Hello Beautiful People,
 

 I hope you are all doing well. Just thought I would maybe reach out to see if anyone could give me some help.
 

 A little about me, I'm 26M who is currently a medical student. 
 

 Growing up, I dealt with bullies in school a lot and I think that affected me growing up.
 

 I have fairly bad social anxiety. I truly wish I had more decent people around me in my life. I had to move around so many times growing up, and leave people behind.
 

 Medical school and pandemic have amplified things as well. Especially because, school and learning was always my solace and the thing that I felt good at. It was something I could identify with. But school is so hard now, I'm not meeting my academic goals, 8 hour long exams wreck me and feel somewhat inferior to classmates. This has pushed me to try and find other ways to identify myself, but I really only have my family who are close to me. It hurts to be in social situations like when I'm at the hospital or casually find people at school that they almost don't even seem interested to get to know me.
 

 I just get really nostalgic all the time too. I feel like I had no trouble making friends when I was young. Now, I just feel awkward and honestly scared to make things worse.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 That's a bit of what's on my mind now. Thank you very much for reading."
"Hey everyone, 26m here. I thought I got away from panic attacks but I've been suddenly having them again. No trigger event has occurred although I'm kinda worried about one thing in particular. I suffer from anxiety and depression and it comes and goes in phases."
Hey guys. I've been doing alright for the past few months but suddenly I've been having panic attacks since yesterday. There hasn't been any major trigger events but some small stressors.
[removed]
Has anyone tried to cure their anxiety by hypnosis sessions?
"So yeah we went out for a hike and got some food and had a chat and I was the centre of attention. I talked a lot more than I’ve ever done in years in a group setting and it felt great. I didn’t have to think about what to say, I just barfed out words and I didn’t stutter or embarrass myself. It felt good being able to just talk like a regular human being instead of being a nervous wreck. Definitely not the end of my SA but this felt really good."
"I've been strugling with anxiety/social anxiety since I was somewhere at the end of high school. I'm 26 now. I remember days when I couldn't normaly go to the market and things like that. It's been two months since the breakup and sometimes anxiety just gets me. During the relationship I was never happier, especially at the beggining. Maybe once or twice and that was near the end I felt anxiety kicks again, but that was short term. And now, it's not easy. Anxiety comes and goes in waves."
"The root of my anxiety comes from a fear of exposing my unworthiness. I used to show up to dates feeling so sick, knowing I had to perform to hide myself and be whoever that person wanted me to be. I’ve gotten much better at showing up to dates as my authentic self and reminding myself that I am worthy and anyone who doesn’t like me for who I truly am isn’t the person for me. 
 

 I just started seeing someone who makes me feel accepted, heard, and appreciated. But now that we’re 6 dates in and things are getting serious, all of a sudden my anxiety is back. It’s like all my walls just came back up, now that I’ve realized I really like this person and don’t want them to reject me. When I’m panicked I go into flight mode, so I completely shut down and can’t think clearly. I become closed off and cold - and don’t know how to stop this response. I feel like I’m self sabotaging. 
 

 Does this resonate with anyone else? Any tips for handling this very vulnerable and precarious part of a new relationship?"
"I (29M) is currently dating a 28F. We’re entering our 3rd week and we have been to 6 dates together. All dates are great and always ended up with a goodbye kiss. For 5th date, I told her I like her and she told me she likes me too. We text like once or twice every day. I do like this woman a lot and she communicated that she likes me, she also would ask me to text her when I get home, often telling me she was worried. 
 

 My problem is I think I’m overthinking things. I get anxious that what if one day, she wakes up and she changes her mind? What if one dat, the wind blows in a different direction? I associate this with my previous datings since I definitely have experienced that.
 

 Everything is going great now and I just hope my anxiety wouldn’t come ruin it. How can I calm my nerves and stop thinking about it? How do I just let the relationship run it’s course naturally?"

"I feel like I always have at least one physical anxiety symptom throughout the day and it sucks. I have GAD, panic disorder, OCD, and hypochondria. I feel tired all the time (could be because my almost two year old still sleeps like crap so I haven’t slept good in years lol) headaches, sometimes dizziness and dissociation feeling, just always feeling like my body is on edge. I’ve dealt with anxiety for so long now (nearly 20 years and I’m only 28) and have months where it’s bad and months when it’s not so bad. The past few weeks have been so bad That I’m very scared something is actually wrong with me :( I have a dr appt coming up but I’m still so worried.."
"It has gotten a lot better, but it's still there. Sundays used to indicate that school was the next day, which really spiked my anxiety. It would be really bad if I had a presentation or something. I'm 26 now, and this feeling shows up every now and then to fuck with me, especially if I have a dream about being in school.
 

 

 It goes away after I refocus myself which I've learned to do over the years. I just hate being tortured by the past."
"So I'm at that point with my anxiety where it's hit a new low. I was prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro/escitalopram by my doctor and was nervous about taking it but eventually I caved because my anxiety only seemed to get worse as time passed. What followed was completely awful. After about an hour I felt really short of breath, my heart was racing/pounding, I felt really weak and shaky, I felt nauseated, I kept getting cold flushes starting from my feet to my chest, I genuinely thought I might be having serotonin syndrome cause it felt that bad(there's no reason that would be the case though as I don't take any other meds that effect serotonin). My dad convinced me not to go to the hospital because he was certain it was just anxiety. I didn't get hardly any sleep(I took it at night), my heart rate stayed above 100 like the entire night(at least all the times I checked). Once I made it to morning I still felt weak and really anxious but after a while my heart rate lowered and I felt a little better. I couldn't do much, not even watch youtube videos which is usually my go to for distractions, it was just too overwhelming. I spent most of the time sitting in bed falling asleep and waking up every few minutes. The anxiety hit me again that night and the next morning and it kind of stayed that way for a few days. It took me around 4 days to finally gain my appetite back and feel more normal again(normal meaning at least able to function how I used to). Even so, ever since then I've been really easy to set off, my migraines have gotten worse, I've been having more brain fog, little to no appetite, I have more times when I feel depressed, it's been a bit rough this month :(
 

 I truly don't understand how or why I had such a big reaction to it. It wasn't a large dose and Lexapro generally has minimal side effects for most people. I did not continue to take it for obvious reasons. It's a bit discouraging honestly. I guess why I'm saying all of this is because I'm just wondering if anyone else ran into the same problem as me? My options are a bit limited. I can try other medications or try to exercise more. Problem is I'm terrified of both. I've tried exercising in the past but I can never stick with it long enough to get to a point where it helps and I'm afraid of what my body will do if I push it past a simple walk. Taking medications makes me incredibly anxious because I really don't want to go through all that again. I was initially nervous about taking it and even then I wasn't expecting that bad of a situation.
 

 Have any of you had something similar happen? Did you ever find out why your body reacted that way? What did you do moving forward?"
"I haven't made up my mind yet, just thinking about it I'm starting to think to myself, ""you're crazy, you're going to be humiliated or worse"", but at the same time I imagine what it's like to talk to people who probably don't have the slightest idea of what's going on in my head. Is the site very bad or not? Should I try Discord first? I need to gain confidence when talking to strangers, I really want to change."
"Hello I'm on 300mg effexor and tbh i feel worse i have been on them about a month and a half. And the month before that i went from 150mg to 225 since then i get morning shakes and sometimes throughout the day.
 

 Fyi i overdosed on anti depressants 10 years ago had lots of therapy also for it. My doc last year told me to go up to 225 i said no and stayed on 150 and i was feeling great till this year. 
 I dont think about the overdose really i just seem to be worse on higher doses. Saw my gp he said my symptons almost like ptsd. Or am i just worrying and its anxiety and im fucked"
"I (28M) started an SSR (Prozac)I a little over a month ago. I had a major meltdown after a 3-4 days of being on it and havent felt right since. The thing im experiencing now is a weird feeling in my ledt arm and leg. Have any of you ever experinced this? Is it the stress? It comes and goes and its not painful. About a week ive had it. 
 

 Just looking for a little comfort. PM me if you want to talk."
"For background, I (F27) have suffered from social anxiety since childhood. I used to experience extreme flushing of chest, face, and neck almost daily when interacting with people (it was particularly bad when public speaking or during conflicts). My anxiety primarily came from fear of blushing. 
 

 Today, I rarely experience flushing or anxiety and I want to share what has worked for me: 
 

 1) therapy - specifically, CBT techniques have been the most helpful. Also, trauma work. 
 

 2) nadolol 40 mg daily - this medication prevents me from experiencing the physical effects of anxiety when I start thinking my way there. 
 

 3) Rhofade daily - I put a little bit of this on my cheeks and neck most mornings and before public speaking to prevent flushing and it works. 
 

 The combination of these interventions has changed my life. I went from being timid and afraid to confident and comfortable. I’m sharing this in case anyone deals with excessive flushing with social anxiety and they want to try out these things too!"
Add me
"Before I start, I don't know if this is related to anxiety, ADHD, or depression, as I have all three, but I think it's mostly anxiety so its here.
 

 I hate responsibility. I don't know when it started but I'm 25 and I am terrified of my job, because now I have too much responsibility. I have an apartment, and its too much. bills and appointments and work and fucking feeding myself properly is too much i want a fucking break. im so tired and stressed but by all accounts I should be fine. i should be happy. i dont think i can live in the society we have because I just dont think im fit for it. i just want to be left alone. i dont want to take initiative i dont want to be proud i dont even want to succeed i just want to be fine and i cant even deal with that. i wish i was rich so i could be fine without a job and have someone take care of me and do my bills and make appointments. i put it off and i ruin my life. i hate it i dont want to be an adult, its too hard.
 

 i dont even know if im making sense but i dont want to live in the world that i have to live in. its not fair and its too much for me."
"Hi Guys,
 

 26M here, hungry and driven to get rid of SA. 
 

 Like all of you, it is holding me back from who I'm meant to be...I've been busting my tail the past few months and have seen some good progress, I'm better than I was before that's for sure.
 

 Looking for a potential buddy or even buddies who are also motivated to improve. We could build each other up, motivate each other, and go out to places to get out of our comfort zones and socialize/practice.
 

 We could start off with maybe discord or something to message each other and go from there. Ideally someone in their 20s or maybe 30s would be best I think, send me a direct message if you're interested.
 

 Have a good weekend guys."
"Thanks for coming to my post! Answers will be truly appreciated as I’m really desperate to figure this anxiety thing out😩
 

 I’m understanding through therapy now that part of recovery is learning to accept the symptoms and just let them be, while moving on with whatever else you were doing or were supposed to do when they occur.
 But how? HOW? Do I just keep on going when all internal alarms sets off and my instinct is flight?
 

 I’m soooo afraid of my physical symptoms - not in the sense that I think they can seriously hurt me, but because I find them so extremely uncomfortable and excruciating.
 

 So how did you learn to accept these feelings? How did you come to terms with just letting them be and doing stuff anyways?"
"25F suffering from GAD.
 

 How do you deal with the unpredictabilty of life?
 I find myself constantly spiralling about how life can throw curveballs at you at any given moment and you just have to… deal I guess? And what if it turns out being way too much and I just kind of break?
 

 I’m 25 right now and I’m actually stressing about having to live the rest of my life with all the challenges and ups and downs it will bring.
 

 I’m not suicidal, but I just feel like I have to foresee and tackle all challenges of the future right now and that makes life really unmanagable for me and my anxiety skyrockets.
 Can anyone relate?
 

 I feel like I’m stuck in a loop where I think “Yes I managed my anxiety well in *this* specific tough situation, but what about the next one? How do I know that that won’t be the one that breaks me for good?”
 

 I guess what I’m trying to say is that the anticipatory anxiety is ruining me and sometimes it feels like a selffulfilling prophecy. And sometimes it works out just fine, but I still don’t “learn” from it because there will always be the uncertainty of “next time”."
"I’ve been holding back feelings for an past lover that’s been in and out of my life for years. But it’s on both ends we always find a way to reach out and that’s cause we can’t let go. I know I can’t express my feelings cause I have many times and it didn’t make much of an differences what I do know is even if we’re just friends I’m ok with it. If something comes more of it I’ll be grateful of that. So many questions I wanna ask him but all I can do is wait patiently.. to even hear from him.. 
 

 Any advice.."
"I'm 25 m and I have social anxiety and Adhd. There may be something else bundled in there but those are the two big things. At the point of writing I've just dipped out of a big night out with some work friends, come home, and cried because I just didn't feel like I belonged there.
 

 I've struggled a lot with making friends throughout my life. When I was younger I got bullied a lot for being ""weird"", and even the friend group that I did have often chastised me for being overly sensitive. As I moved into secondary school a lot of this continued. I'd never felt truly accepted for who I was and valued as a part of a social group. My home life wasn't much better as my house was a none stop screaming match between my parents and brother so I never really got much exposure to the family group either.
 

 As such I kind of just developed on my own. I was happy enough to do so, but i never got to practice my social skills outside of playing with strangers online, so I've struggled making friends into my adult life. My interests are my own and I have never really had a social group where I share than more than one interest with them. I had a group of friends I played halo with online, but outside of that there was nothing else for us to talk about. I developed my own taste in music and humour as well, not particularly sharing these with anyone as I got older.
 

 Now I just find it so damn hard to relate to people.
 

 I'm not saying I never had friends, I had plenty and do as an adult, but I don't (and didn't) feel particularly close to them. Nobody ever seems to understand my jokes or share my interests or understand my point of view. Its like I've been alienated for so long that I don't even understand how a social group is meant to function. Most of the time if I interject in a conversation I'm either interrupted or totally ignored. And then I feel like an absolute idiot for even trying to get involved.
 

 I'd really love to feel like an accepted and cherihed part of a group, I love socialising when it goes well but I find it so exhausting. I don't seem to be able to enjoy myself in the ways others do and I hate it. I have tried so hard to emulate and understand but I just don't know how to fit in. I'm tired of being surrounded by people all the time but feeling completely isolated. 
 

 I don't know why I'm posting this really, I just feel like shit and I guess I'm wondering if anyone has any advice? How do you cope with overthinking every sentence you're about to say and the disgust you feel at yourself when it inevitably comes out wrong? How are you supposed to get close to people when 90% of the time you genuinely can't think of a single thing to say to them? What are you meant to do when neithr being yourself nor ""faking it til you make it"" are working?"
"I 26m am going through a rough patch atm I lost the space that was crucial to running my business as well as came to the realization after working very hard for the last year and a half that I couldn’t make my
 Car detailing business work from a financial perspective. I probably made about 10 or 20k in the last year which unfortunately isn’t enough to live off of especially given the city I live in is amoung the most expensive in North America. It’s with this that I have realized that I am only getting further from reaching my goals one of them being buying myself my dream car which is a 10 year old f150. 
 

 I’m pretty well stumped as to what I should do for work now a huge part of the reason I went to work for myself was that for years I had struggled in many different work places as I was subject to what felt like endless work place harassment and bullying. So going into a new workplace is very intimidating for me for that reason and it doesn’t help matters that most of the jobs I can do will basically leave me nothing to live off of 50k where im from is basically nothing and I probably would even get close to that. 
 

 I also broke up with my girlfriend of 3.5 months about a week or two ago. Although I think I made the right choice in breaking up with her it hasn’t helped matters and I miss her dearly. 
 

 I also feel as though I don’t have the support of my family it was only a few days ago that I was able to have a serious conversation with my mom about the going ons in my life for years she has been to pre occupied with her set group or what my brother who lives thousands of miles away is doing and anytime I needed to talk it was inconvenient for her or she didn’t have the patience. I started seeing a therapist a year ago and while that has helped he’s not super available and sometimes I need to talk to someone in the moment. 
 

 I have some support from my dad but I feel as though he is distancing himself as my mom did a few years ago which has been extremely difficult. 
 

 I was looking at becoming a trucker but my parents where pretty well against it and I don’t feel that I can take the leap without more support. 
 

 I’m not sure what to do honestly I don’t think I will ever be able to make a reasonable living and I’m having a very hard time grasping that as all my hopes and dreams are being crushed because of this reality. I guess in many ways I have lost hope. I’m sort of questioning if I should sell my car buy my dream truck and drive down to Florida which I really enjoy and maybe go visit my new nephew and my two nieces in California maybe that will help me re evaluate things and clear my head some more. 
 

 What do you guys think I would appreciate any help as my mental health is not good right now thank you"
"Hey guys, I have been an avid follower of this sub for a long time and this place has been a constant source of panic attack relievers over the last few months. In my last session with my therapist, he told me that GAD is cured after 6 months of literal hell and dedication. I want to share what worked for me.
 

 **Background:** As with my fellow GAD sufferers, I have been suffering from constant worries and usual panic attacks over the last few years but I decided to take action about this (didn't know it was GAD back then) after a full-blown attack that lasted for hours and hours in early May this year. Started my treatment late May. In one of the panic attacks I was contemplating committing suicide but thank god I had the courage to stick to my routine.
 

 **Symptoms:** Luckily, never had any physical symptoms but diarrohea and mouth ulcers were common because of cortisol developed by Amygdala.
 

 **Aftermath:** I am waking up everyday with a buoyant mood and my life including social life, dating life and academic performance, all have improved!
 

 So, let's finally begin:
 

 1. **Therapy:** Can't emphasize this more, CBT therapists will identify the problematic and impractical thought patterns associted with your Anxiety( especially if it's Cortex-based) and suggest you ways to cope with them via ABCDE, RRR techniques and so on. Some of these will work for you will and some not but these people are medical experts and you need to spend 2-3 months with a therapist before deciding to discontinue/move to a different Therapist. Self-therapy books do help but it's always better to have someone in the form of close friend or a therapist to assist in your journey.
 2. **Reading Books:** Rewire your Anxious Brain, The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety, and My Age of Anxiety, are the top 3 books I recommend. Finally, I'd suggest reading posts on this sub. **Caution:** there are chances of feeling uneasiness or having panic attacks by reading few content so make sure you tell your brain that this is medicine beforehand
 3. **Meditation:** atleast 2-3 times in a day for 12.5 mins everyday. It's only one day in the last 6 months I missed doing this wonderful thing.Buddhist style of meditation worked for me. Mantra meditation, guided meditation are other alternatives. There are wide variety of resources available online. It could be possible that you don't see the effects in the initial few weeks but I'd suggest keep doing it blindly.
 4. **Gym:** 6 days a week non-stop in the last 6 months except for the weeks when I was travelling. It's scientifically proven that doing physical activity for more than 20 mins almost everyday improves mental health. Technically, doing exercises helps the body release endorphins that rearrange the synapse between the neurons if done for 10 weeks to see a significant results. This is massive in improving thought patterns
 5. **Being open:** Being open about your anxiety with your closed ones will enable to learn new strategies, perspectives and many more things. More importantly, you will have shoulders to fall upon during a full-blown panic attack
 

 **Others:** practicing gratitude daily, practicing my hobbies( soccer).

 Let me know if you have any questions"
"I (25F) will be going to the dr pretty soon to finally(I say finally because I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety my whole life, just unmedicated) start some medication, but I am wondering how honest can I be with my dr? I don’t want to worry them too much, but I’m to the point that I need help and none of my normal coping methods help me anymore. 
 My usual coping methods are watching my favorite shows, listening to my favorite band, sleeping more (when I can), going to therapy, talking about it openly with people closest to me, drinking more water, and taking walks around my neighborhood."
"Hi everyone, and apologies for the long post but I will try to keep it as brief as possible.
 

 **TL;DR: I have social anxiety and I get along with one girl at office really well. She kissed me and asked for a relationhship but then rejected me. We are back to normal as friends but now I feel really sad because I feel like this girl is special and my soulmate. But this is only one-sided. I have no idea what to do.**
 

 I am 27 (M) and been lonely for my whole life. No girlfriends, not even a close interaction with any girl, few friends who are now living at somewhere else so I see them rarely. I do everything (going outside, eating, shopping etc.) alone.
 

 However, my relationship with one girl (28) at the office is special and I know her for 1,5 years. But our talks are limited to work hours only, we rarely talked after work so I never assumed anything other than friendship. However, while drunk she kissed me and said she wants a relationship. I said think about it when you are sober and we should talk about this later because I could not believed someone would ever think such a thing with me. After being sober, she apologised and said a relationship can happen naturally if it ever will. We talked afterwards and she said she consider me as her friend, she has career goals and not looking for a relationship.
 

 After these events, she stayed away from me, avoid talking to me and I was really sad that I have no one else at the office to talk to as a friend so I felt lonely. Last week, she was back to normal, she came to me and started talking and it was a slow day last friday so we talked for two hours straight. I was really happy.
 

 But now, I feel extremely depressed and cried all over the weekend because I really want this girl to be part of my life, that we talk not only at the office but all the time, that we spend time together outide work. I have two best friends from my childhood that I know more than 20 years and I really get along with this girl like she is a friend from my childhood though I only know her from work for 1,5 years. Never ever before I get along with someone this well. I truly feel like she is my soulmate and a person that I can meet one in a lifetime.
 

 I don't know if she felt heartbroken because I -kind of- rejected her when we were drunk and she stayed away or she really changed her mind about relationship. Obviously the former even makes me feel sadder.
 

 But what makes me feel saddest is that this is (or could be) a one sided thing that I am feeling. She talks with me for two hours, she laughs a lot, talks me about her secrets, gossiping etc. and she really does not feel anything? Are all the talks from 1,5 years is for really nothing? Does the drunk talk really not mean anything?
 

 I have no idea what to do next but I feel so sad that I am feeling amazing about this girl but it is only one sided and I have no chance to make her part of my life.
 

 Thank you so much if you read this to the end. Any comment is appreaciated."
"Hi all! I’m (25F) a well-seasoned health anxiety experiencer. It was triggered in 2019 after a traumatic experience witnessing a cancer-related deterioration and ultimately death of a close loved one. Before that any anxiety I had was purely generalized, but that experience set me on the HA path.
 

 2019 was the worst year for me by far — I started having panic attacks and it got to the point where I was agoraphobic and then spent some time in the hospital because of how awful it had gotten. It caused me to quit my job and take a semester off of college. 
 

 I ended up getting “better” (took almost a year) and moving past it… all up until just over a month ago! I hit another flareup and it sucks ass!
 

 But I’m already finding my success is coming quicker. I am a chronic “what if” thinker—what if I never recover from this? What if I’m gaslighting myself and it actually IS something this time? What if I end up in the hospital again?
 

 Nope! All bullshit. I’m still fighting through it, but I’m doing okay and here’s how you can too:
 

 1. Everyone says this but stay the hell off of Google. The algorithm is designed to scare the shit out of you, and it will tell you nothing useful. If you can’t quite kick the habit, add “anxiety” to your search. If you’re anxious about an ache or pain or uncomfortable sensation, you’ll end up
 feeling it BECAUSE of that.
 

 2. Try to logically examine why you might be experiencing aches or pains. Have you eaten today (I know it can be hard because of appetite loss but still)? Drink fluids? Bad posture? Eye strain? Sufficient sleep? Chances are you hurt because you need to take better care of yourselt.
 

 3. A CBT method of externalizing your anxiety. I make my anxious thoughts a separate existence from me. My brain trying to tell me I’m gonna have a heart attack? “Ah, that silly anxiety doing its thing again. No thanks.” And something that helped even more was externalizating the follow up “Well what if it isn’t anxiety this time?” Nope! That’s anxiety too.
 

 4. Exercising. I used to not believe this would help but it does. It teaches me my body is strong and healthy. Even yoga, meditation, deep breathing, etc. are small things that are still beneficial. 
 

 5. PLEASE TRY THERAPY! I’m on week 5 of CBT and let me tell you even if the methods aren’t successful for you, just having the opportunity to talk to someone is a breath of fresh air.
 

 6. Do not overly seek out reassurance. Family members, partners, and friends reassuring you may be helpful in the moment but it’s only temporary because unless they are doctors wtf do they know about health? It’s okay to get hugs or vent, I do with my wife, but I’ve also asked her to hold me accountable for dispelling my own thoughts. 
 

 7. Limit your doctors visits. I only allow
 myself what is required of me (checkups etc). I do have a few actual ailments that require imaging, but otherwise I don’t have the money to be constantly in ER or my PCP’s office. And for many, including myself, that relief is usually only temporary too. Doctors know what they’re doing though, so if you’ve been a lot PLEASE take their word for it. 
 

 8. 2 week rule: this is another good one. If I’m having a discomfort that lasts longer than two werks, THEN I consider a PCP visit. But more often than not it just goes away before then. Just recently I was having uncomfortable stomach cramps for 3-4 days (logically I think I ate bad eggs whoops), but told myself I have to wait 2 weeks before seeking care. guess what? They went away yesterday. 
 

 9. PERSISTENCE! Instead of retreating to agoraphobia this time, I literally FORCED myself to continue functioning normally. I have a job and a life, and neither stop. I continued to work, went out with my wife, did things we love, played games, and kept attempting at life normally. Each passing day I proved to myself that I was not going to give into this silly experience, and it has helped me tremendously. It can be really hard to not leave a “safe space”, but trust me when I say that the more you do it, the more victorious you feel. And you can even start small.
 

 10. BE KIND TO YOURSELF AND DON’T FIGHT IT! One of my biggest weaknesses is being hard on myself because of this irrational thinking. I get mad at myself for letting these intrusive thoughts get to me, and guess what? It makes everything 1000 times worse. Being mad at myself for struggling to be present solves nothing. You have to give yourself some slack. Take self care days. Tell yourself that it’s okay to be anxious, and that you are capable of having the strength to conquer it. Fighting anxiety makes it worse—learn how to accept the discomfort and roll with it. 
 

 11. Medication is okay to try if you think it’ll help. It can be a great crutch to push those REALLY struggling in the right direction, but IMO I don’t think it’s meant to be a long term solution. A lot of the work has to come from within. I have never responded well to any SSRIs/SNRIs, so I only really have myself to rely on. But having that boost is totally valid. 
 

 12. This one goes out to all my fellow cardiophobes/heart-focused HAs! Firstly, hearts do not just “stop” and you aren’t going to spontaneously drop dead. Your heart is an extremely powerful organ and can withstand more than you think, especially if you’re young. Most arrhythmias (that you probably don’t have if you think you do) are not only rare but also not life-threatening. I have a double whammy being cardiophobic AND having raging POTS. It is what it is. My heart is just an over-achiever and likes to show off. Don’t we all. I’m not going to say “you’ll know for sure when something is wrong” because with panic disorder/anxiety we mfs ALWAYS think that, but pain/discomfort that comes and goes is very normal. A sick heart won’t EVER stfu and will progressively get worse. Delete the HR/EKG function on your Apple Watch, you know next to nothing about normal heart rates and rhythms even with Google and you’ll freak yourself out. Look up York Cardiology on YT—this guy was a lifesaver and explains things clearly and realistically.
 

 13. If you’re on this sub then you’re clearly aware that what you’re experiencing is HA and not a real medical concern. Let that speak for itself. 
 14. Do NOT EVER give up. I know HA can feel like there’s no end in sight and that it’s insurmountable. I still struggle with that nagging feeling. But you CAN do it. The more you prove to yourself you’re capable, the easier it becomes. You will not miss out on life, and you will not become a shell of a human.
 

 I’m still getting through it and have bad days and great days, but I always tell myself I’m capable and celebrate my victories. You deserve to have yours. Sending love and strength!"
"When I was younger I was bullied by girls, and apparently I never got over it, I'm 26 years old.
 I can't smile or express any emotion, my body becomes rigid, I start to judge myself and hope they don't look at me. If I have to speak, I always say quick answers, so low that even I can't hear and I feel my voice breaking. I just think: ""I'm so ugly, don't look at me"".
 I feel very fragile for a man, very unmanly."
"Like, for example, I get extremely anxious at the doctors office, any kind of medical anything. I hate making visits and it's always a huge thing when I do. Today my parents scheduled for me to have a dentist appointment without saying anything to me first. Granted their reasoning was sound. Insurance is changing next month and they wanted me to get in before it changed because I haven't gone in a long time and there's a waiting period where it won't cover dental for the first part of next year so more than likely won't be able to get it covered before I turn 26 and have to get off their insurance. Hopefully that makes sense. Yes I know I'm 25 and still not really independent. I have issues okay and I'm already in a mood so I don't want to talk about it. That's not point anyway.
 

 Anyways the appointment was originally the 15th but now it's the 7th and I'm losing my mind. The world is ending, everything sucks, I hate my body and it's constant neediness, I wish I could completely detach myself from my body and just put it on autopilot while my consciousness goes and does something else. I'm tired of having to be pleasant on the outside while my insides feel like I'm being strangled. I'm so sick of this specific feeling, like an animal that's been cornered and has no choice but to either lash out or comply with whatever is happening. Obviously I usually comply but the amount of rage and anxiety I feel is excessive. It passes after little while but idk why my emotions reach a much higher level than usual. Similar thing happened when I got called in for jury service or when I've had school assignments that require me to step way outside of my comfort zone like asking strangers to fill out a survey.
 

 I just get so much rage mixed with anxiety. Constantly feel like crying. Maybe it's that I feel like I have no control, like I'm trapped. Anger because it's other people who are forcing my hand, it wasn't my choice and to them it's so much easier because they don't deal with anxiety like I do. But then I look like the bad guy for freaking out over ""nothing"". So instead I have to bottle it up and be pleasant despite everything I feel. And I know it's not their fault either, if I ever did lash out at them they wouldn't deserve it. They're just doing their job. I'm more angry at the situation. 
 

 I don't get this feeling as much when I have plenty of time to process that I'm gonna have to do something stressful. I especially don't get as much of that rage, even more so if it was my choice."
Im 29 single for 10 years i get really anxious getting close to someone. Took an overdose at 18 pretty much every day since i get anxiety attacks i did used to get a break from it and keep it under wraps last year got promoted worked my ass off. Then came this year lost my appetite then sleep went shit i was on 150mg effexor at this point and i saw the signs coming. Got offered another promotion just about had it too. Then i burnt out had about 2 months off at work in a job that allows 10 days a year. Got put up to 225mg then started getting tremors in the morning and tiredd so much. Cut my hours down at work that was a first. Went up to 300mg still the same and started therapy. psychiatrist made a brief comment about possibly being on the spectrum due to constant anxiety recently. Ended up in a+e Sunday that was also a first thanks to being so low. Today my psychiatrist said to my mum need to stop therapy as its too much for me. My mum asked about my meds he said they should work and she also asked for valium as i have had it before and do use it responsibly he said not while I'm in therapy. Isn't that just contradicting what he said... She also Told him because he mentioned autism that i now should be tested (fml if i am). Not at work anymore either I'm on an island with one mental health service so can't pick and choose really. So i don't know FUCK. Sorry i needed to get it off
"I finally decided to talk to a gynecologist about getting tubual ligation, and thankfully he agreed to it. (Which shocked me ngl. I was expecting a difficult fight, or a long waiting period, mandated counseling etc. So if you've been thinking about it don't be scared to talk to a doctor about it.) Originally I was told there was a 30 day waiting period, but apparently my insurance doesn't require it and they could schedule me sooner. 
 

 So I got scheduled for a week from now ( bc my alternative was January and I have plans to leave the job my insurance is tied to)...and suddenly I'm getting cold feet. I've thought about this for years, talked about it to most of my friends, family, partner, co-workers and my therapist...but now suddenly I'm scared. Not the procedure itself, I've had surgery before. Complications and recovery are pretty minimal. Its all FOMO. Fear I'm making the wrong choice, that I might change my mind. Yet I'm aware of the other options like adoption, volunteering etc and I'm open to them. And fear of committment is definitely not new for me.
 

 Is this normal? Did it happen to you? How did you get through it? If you've gotten your tubes tied how do you feel about it?"
"I (27M) don't really know how to explain this. For some months now I've been feeling a bit slow and weird. I\`m talking about memory, attention and cognitive performance in general, which I feel reduced. I was even considering going to a doctor because I had covid and I heard about this ""brain fog"".
 

 However,  something happened that really scared me. I was having lunch with some  guys I just met and I asked them how old they were. They looked at me  strangely, and say, you dont remember? You just asked a few moments  back. This happened today and I'm still shocked. It's not like after they told me that I suddenly remembered, but that I still have literally no memory trace of that.
 

 It  really felt like having Alzheimer, and I'm scared. I'm going to the  doctor but I wanted to know if someone here has any comment. I have  quite a lot of anxiety, and at that particular moment I was actually feeling really anxious, but again, I've been having anxiety many years and this is the first time something like this happens."
"I (27F) have social anxiety. In unfamiliar social settings, my brain shuts down. When I’m asked a question, I feel like the spotlight is on me, panic, then give the most dumbest answer ever. I could very well know the answer, but I don’t know what happens at that particular time. 
 

 This week, a minor accident happened on my driveway. The police asked me about some details, at that point I couldn’t even think clearly. For this reason, they pointed out the inconsistency with what other people reported. I feel like this is part of the reason they didn’t follow up as a result, and I didn’t get compensated. I just hate myself. I wish I could just act normal even in social settings. What can I do to reduce this blackout?"
"i’m thinking back to my old jobs and i don’t remember anyone’s name. i worked at walmart about 6 months ago and the only names i remember are like people that i actually had a connection to, so like two people and the team leader. Is that normal? I never take the time to remember anyone’s name..i always think it’s better to introduce myself to them but i never do them i just end up not really talking to them..i’ve even gotten close to a coworker there kind of and i couldn’t guess her name if my life depended on it. is that normal? i’ve always been HORRIBLE with names."
"I’m constantly anxious about leaving the house - worried that i left candles burning, irons on, stove on, etc etc. usually i combat this by double checking everything before i leave and taking pictures of the things off i can go back and look at if i’m Anxious. usually i unplug my hair straightener and put it in view of my pet camera as well. 
 

 today i was running late and didn’t do that. i’m almost positive i unplugged it anyway, because i remember using it to touch up my bangs quickly and unplugging it before it really even got too hot. but of course that’s not what my anxiety says. 
 

 anyways I suppose Im just venting. let me know if you think my house will burn down if it does happen to be left on and sitting on my bathroom counter 😞"
"We are both students and during her studies, she developed severe panic attacks, social anxiety and anxiety disorder which caused her severe stomach cramps. So she struggled a lot with her studies and often liked to be alone, but she had different interests, painting, activism, fitness, healthy eating, anime... Every time she had an obligation or a stressful situation she would take a Xanax and get it done and then go back to her hobbies and things that excite her. But after we returned after corona online year and a half lectures back live to the faculty I noticed that she behaves distant and disinterested. At first, I thought it was just because we hadn't seen each other in person for so long, so she was getting used to the stressful environment. But her roommates noticed the same. She no longer had panic attacks and anxiety, it was easier for her to socialize and it was easier for her to fulfil her duties at the faculty, but most of the time she was disinterested. And she repaired her relationship with her family who never understood her anxiety and always expected the best from her. But she stopped doing almost all her hobbies, started smoking, spends most of her free time watching tv and started to live quite unhealthily (she has a serious health condition of muscle deterioration that requires her to regularly exercise which she doesn't do anymore). As if she has built walls around herself or as if she lives in her own bubble and if anyone challenges her she just retreats without any reaction. And she just stopped enjoying herself. It is difficult to explain her change.
 

 And so this week the two of us sat down and talked. So she admitted to me that she is worried because this fall she got some new medicines instead of Xanax which she has to take regularly, it's the smallest possible dose, but it affects her a lot (sorry, I don't remember the name of that new medicine). And that she is worried that the way she behaves because of the medicine would drive her friends away because her roommates criticized her for her behaviour. But even then sometimes she does not immediately understand or notice criticism towards herself in some situations. She also admitted to me that she has lost interest in her former hobbies, that her libido is low and that she generally feels numb. That she often says something without thinking how that comes across as cold and wrong, or in her words "" feeling whatever"". So she asked me to hold on with her and not to blame her if she say or do something like that to me. But she doesn't know what to do because she is aware of the problem when she looks back on some situations, but that she can't go back to the old way where she often had severe anxiety and panic attacks. But still, when she thinks about stressful situations she gets cramps and has nightmares so it doesn't even help her completely.
 

 **TLDR: I'm worried because my best friend has completely lost interest in everything she used to be interested in because of the medication for anxiety and panic attacks, and I don't know how to help her or make it easier for her. Please can you give me any advice?**"
"Has anyone ever panicked over something so much that they couldn't even think straight? I randomly panicked today and had to have my mom take me to my apartment, I'm 27 lol. Anyone relate?"
"So I got prescribed diazepam 5mg for 5 days I never took it before so kinda scared to take it . 
 I asked my doctor will I get addicted to it and he said no as long as u don't take more than one at night or something like that . Idk why he gave it to me for sleeping when I habe my mirizapan for that. He also gave me another antidepressants but I heard if u mix mirizapan and the new one u can get serious reaction from it .. so I'm just wondering should I take the diazepam I'm scared il get addicted to it"
"I just want to see if this is an option. Would this be a bad idea? I’m currently using my phone almost all the time to keep myself less anxious. So having that taken might be a major detriment. But I was thinking I could meet people there since I”m by myself for most the day and I think that’s one reason for my anxiety getting so bad again (people who also need help though). What can they do for somebody suffering anxiety attacks and things like that? I really don’t want to be locked in a room all night with no way of getting out, or not being able to eat when I need to (I seem to need to eat more frequently then most and get really anxious from it some times). 
 

 Any suggestions?"
"I haven't met any of my friends in 4.5 years (I'm too scared to message them). I haven't really left the house in 3. I live with abusive parents who have prevented me from getting a job. Everyone from my past has moved on. I'm going to fail grad school.
 

 Everything was perfect when I was in college 5 years ago. But then I had to come back home. I wouldn't even know how to start my life again."
"This is kind of long story since there's a lot of history behind my experience, so thank to anyone who took the time to read. 
 

 About 4 years ago when I was 23, (I'm 27M right now) I was having sharp headaches in very specific parts of my head and I read once that someone who had experienced that happened to be having an aneurysm. That caused me to have probably the worst anxiety attack in my life. I began having pain in other parts of my body too around that time. I became a bit manic and wound up going to an urgent care doctor who had a CT scan machine. They checked my head out and said that I was fine and they didn't find anything. At the time I was following a ketogenic diet, with one meal a day fasting, and drinking a large cold brew coffee every morning. I didn't know that this was bad for your stomach. Anyway the doctor asked me if I had taken advil for the headaches, I said yes I was taking the recommended dosage every day, and he told me it would be fine to double that to alleviate the symptoms. So I did that. Then not too long later after taking 1600 mg of advil (or something like that) on an empty stomach everyday with black coffee, I felt a painful swelling in my abdomen on my left side.
 

 This was the first time I had ever felt this so I was pretty panicked. Was also feeling major fatigue, peripheral pain in my arms and legs, and overall just feeling terrible. I went to a different urgent care doctor after that and he said I had Gastritis. The diet he recommended didn't really help, and from searching online I found what I was feeling could leaky gut syndrome. There wasn't a lot of study behind it online but the diet that I found in articles for that actually helped a lot. At least temporarily. 
 

 Over time I had experienced a bunch of weird symptoms despite the gastritis being better, like muscle twitching, mild sore pain around my mid back and neck, heavy fatigue, and mild nausea. I didn't have insurance at the time so I was just carrying on praying it would just stop and that I didn't have cancer or something. 
 

 Fast forward to april 2020, at this point I'm 25, and have gained a bit of weight. The health issues I were experiencing made it difficult to follow a low carb diet that always kept my weight down, and to stay motivated to work out. However, april 2020 gave me a lot of free time as it did everyone, and I started focusing on my stress and got back on a good diet. Keto again but this time no advil. For the months from april 2020 to August 2020, I was feeling great. I lost around 30 pounds, and hadn't had any health issues ir weird symptoms anymore. I fell off the diet after agust though, and then by october I gained a few pounds back and then one day I woke up and felt very dizzy, and my heart kept beating weird. I also was shirt of breath, and it felt like there was something inside my lungs preventing me from filling my lungs completely. I just couldn't quite get full breaths which was very uncomfortable.  
 

 I went to the ER, and they did bloodwork, and chest xrays, and found nothing. I just kept living with it and working with this for the following months until Jan 2021. 
 

 Finally I had health insurance again. I got a Primary care physician, they send me to a cardiologist, I had a full work up, stress tests, EKG, and ultrasound or whatever the test is to look at the structure of your heart. They said I was experiencing PVC's but they went away while I was active during the stress test. They told me they didn't know why I was having the PVCs, but probably weight gain (at this point I've gained 30 pounds back, around 230 lbs, for a 5'8"" male. For the following months I start doing things that I enjoy and trying to eat at least a little better, and exercise more, and the PVCs never cane back. But there were still some issues... 
 

 My lung capacity improved over time, but not entirely. I still get out of breath sometimes and I don't know why. Granted I could be out of shape, but at 5'8"" and 230, I know thats over weight but I have family thats way larger and seem to function without these issues. 
 

 The G.I. problems would keep coming and going, and I woukd have bouts where I would wake up and be dizzy, and weak, and always seemed to happened when my stomach wasn't right. And I would also feel sharp pains inside of my chest that I was worried was cancer (another thing to note, I worry about cancer a lot because I work with pesticides, and grew up around cigarettes smoke indoors, and vaped a lot through my early 20s). 
 

 I saw my doctor about this stuff but I've fallen into this cycle of seeing my doctor, my doctor prescribing meds without diagnosing cause if the pain inside me, and then switching insurance at the end of the year, switching doctors, and having them do the same. None have ordered ct scans, or sent me to a G.I. Specialist. American healthcare, particularly in CA sucks right now. 
 

 Last fast forward to last Friday, I had been doing alright and feeling alright for the past year. Some pains popping up hear and there, and still out of breath but I try not to let it get to me. I always did have this looming ""when is the other show going to drop"" if the pain and breathlessness was undiagnosed cancer or something. I also have a friends whose mother suddenly passed away from undiagnosed lung cancer that exacerbated these thoughts. Last friday I developed some back pain on my middle left. Then throughtout the day it was spreading to my stomach area on the left, and just gnawing at me. By friday night I was feeling really fatigued, and weak, and nauseous again. Saturday morning I woke uo in even more pain and weakness, but my girlfriend and I had tickets to LA comic con, and I kept telling myself it was just anxiety. I kept wondering all day, did I have pancreatitis? Was it pancreatic cancer this whole time? Did it spread from my lungs? Is it my kidneys? I tried to keep those thoughts out of my head, and I kinda felt better throughout the day but not completely.  
 Sunday/monday a bit better, tried to do some stretching, and went to the gym, tried to eat stomach healthy stuff, high and fiber and what not, and I was okay but still not feeling well. Today, Tuesday, I woke up much earlier than normal and could not go back to sleep due to the gnawing on my left side, inside of me. I felt really sick and nauseous, peripheral pain in my arms and legs, constantly using the bathroom with not much happening, and the pain radiating around my back and feeling hot. I had to call out of work and wound up going to that same urgent care doctor from 4 years ago with the CT scan machine. Unfortunately the machine wasn't working today, but besides that, I had bloodwork done, ultrasound of my kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen, and a urinalysis. Everything came back fine. They gave me a ""G.I. Cocktail"" which was a mixture of Milanta, some other sruff and numbing agents. The doctor said that it would go through my system and numb my gastrointestinal track, and if I stopped feeling pain, they could confirm that it was G.I. related at least. Unfortunately the pain didn't stop at all. The pain to begin with was moderate, and maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10, but still too difficult to function normally with. They spoke to my PCP, and I'm going to see a gastroenterologist soon, and I'm going back for the CT scan of my chest and abdomen next week when their machine works again, but anyway what I'm really here to ask is this: 
 

 Besides the gastrointestinal stuff, could all of the other pain really be from anxiety? Has any one else here really experienced this to that level? Sharp recurring chest pains, Deep Fatigue, constant nausea, random nerve pains throughout my body, pain radiating around my back to my chest and left side? Now that I'm home from the doctor, half of me is glad that they found nothing, but on the other hand I can't even lay down and relax comfortably because I just feel so sick and like my body is failing on me. Half of me keeps telling myself ""you're fine, it's anxiety, you know this, you've been through it before"" and the other half of me keeps thinking ""this is the worst you've felt so far, it's probably more than anxiety, am I going to feel better? How am I going to make it through work tomorrow, the doctors found nothing and I have no excuse to call out, they haven't looked at my lungs or stomach yet, I probably have cancer"".  
 

 This sucks."

"I (f26) have been trying so hard to get in shape, I’ve been going to the gym most days. I’ve been working rly hard on myself physically and mentally 
 

 But today when I was at the gym I was in the free weights area, a boy walked past me to get some weights from the end amd he knocked over my water bottle, he shouted ‘I’m so sorry’ and I said ‘ it’s fine’ and I smiled and picked my bottle back up then went back to lifting, then the boy said to me ‘what u working on today’, I looked at him and said ‘what’ and he said ‘are u doing your shoulders’, I said ‘oh yeah shoulders today’ at that point he sat on the bench next to me and started talking to me, I felt nervous coz I have sa, I was planning on doing a lot of sets but I thought I’ll just do 2 then leave, then his friend came over and the 3 of us where talking for a while then we started talking about education then they asked how old I am, I said 26 they where saying I look much younger and they couldn’t believe I was 26, one said u look so young and innocent like a virgin and they both laughed and I laughed too then the other one asked ‘are u a virgin’ and I said yeah, then they where both laughing again, I felt like everyone in the gym was staring at me and laughing at me, I pretended it didn’t bother me but inside I was dying. They where asking me why I was a virgin, they both talked rly loud so it was embarrassing. When I eventually got away I went to the locker room and started crying. I can’t go back to that gym now I’ll have to go to one far away. 
 

 It rly sucks coz I’m working rly hard on my health, lately it feels like I try so hard but I end up in a worse place than I was before."
"My boyfriend (25m) and I (25f) have been dating for nearly 2 years and live together. He is the kindest human. This is the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in but I’m having these anxious feelings. I have thoughts of “do I really like him romantically?” “Do I want to buy a house or get engaged to him”. I’ve been honest with him that I’m having these feelings and not sure if my anxiety is what causing these feelings or if these feelings are causing my anxiety. 
 

 

 Has anyone ever experienced anything like this?"
"hi all, thoughts and reassurance greatly appreciated
 

 lately i am just feeling insane from anxiety.  i was diagnosed in 2020 with OCD which often goes hand in hand with anxiety (atleast for me). specifically when things feel out of my control/knowledge, that really sets me on a spiral. 
 

 tonight as i was refilling one of those daily meds containers, one dropped out (20mg lexapro) and fell on the floor into a pile of clothes. i searched high and low for it, shook out every piece of clothing and looked anywhere it may have rolled but haven’t found it. i looked so hard in that particular corner of the house that i’m wondering if i just imagined it falling?? or if i picked it up and somehow forgot??
 

 i also got it in my head that one of my cats must have eaten it for it to disappear, even though i don’t remember any of them being in the room with me when i dropped it/was initially shaking out the clothes. i feel like i’m going crazy with these obsessive ideas i just ruminate on."
"Hello,
 

 28yr old male here. Struggling with anxiety and panic attacks which have turned into panic disorder since 2017. 
 A little bit of background before I get into my situation: I grew up I in a cult basically sheltered from the outside world until highschool when I did experience normal I felt evil for doing so. Mother had severe anxiety and depression growing up I blamed myself for doing 'evil' things which God disproved of which caused her and my family to go through all this. I submerged myself into my beliefs around 17 and was 100% in. 
 I was a bright kid, always positive, quick witted, great with numbers, real party guy lots of friends decently chill to hang out with from what others would say about me. 
 Fast forward to 23 yr old me, I had the first panic attack developed some sort of hyperawareness of my body and what I am feeling. I get dizzy, clammy and the classic panic attack symptoms. I freak out I go to the doctor. Im fine. It's been the case up to now that I'm 28. 
 

 Here's my situation: that bright kid is gone. Nothing brings me joy that would back then. But my biggest issue is that I am not as quick as I was before. At work I feel slow. I work in finance and sometimes I need to be able to articulate and communicate with our clients and analyze data but now I feel foggy, slow, anxious... basically incompetent. I overthink my decisions which causes there to be errors and above all a loss of trust from my team and clients. Also my memory is shot now and I feel as if I cannot sleep. I wake up tired. 
 

 Anyone with anxiety go through this and how have you overcome it? Should I do more tests to see if this can be maybe something wrong with my brain? 
 Please help.."
"I’m currently considering taking CDB oil (not containing THC) on a regular basis to prevent or calm down my body in terms of my regular panic attacks from GAD.
 

 I’m doing therapy as well but I constantly find that my nervous system just won’t relax so that I can heal, so this is why I’m considering the CBD oil.
 

 So I want to hear about your experiences with it.
 People with other types of anxiety are welcome to comment their experiences as well!"
"I (29M) have been struggling with my anxiety and depression since graduating college, though had a growing social anxiety and depression since middle school. Recently, I have been questioning if all my accomplishments are worth it with my lack of social life. However, there is a fear of socializing, and losing what I have now (family image, girlfriend, the few friends I have now, etc.). It seems as if I am in a perpetual loop in which I am fearful of being alone, but fearful of socializing to find myself and risk losing what little social life I already have. 
 

 Thoughts?"
"My social anxiety makes me feel like I am in a freaking prison. And it can feel so damn lonely. Seriously, I am unable to word out my feelings, unable to invite anyone for anything, holding grudges for pretty much everything, always this strange feeling in my stomach and chest, feeling like I'm about to cry... I don't know what to do anymore"
Do you live in the same house as your parents or alone or do you share with strangers? I was thinking that if I move out of my parents' house I can get a room and force myself to socialize with strangers.
"I've always been scared of lifts, huge crowds and cows. Yes, cows. But these fears were few and far between and my life was full and enjoyable. 
 

 I (27F) have had a bit of a traumatic childhood; I was SA'd by one of my family members, and abused in other ways. I was a bit anxious as a kid, but slowly got better and by my late teens, enjoyed life as one should. I had no panic attacks, no anxious thoughts unrelated to my fears, and everything was good.
 

 I joined the military at 22 and went on deployment, thoroughly enjoying being busy and working hard. I has loads of friends and was comfortable financially.
 Deployment was good - I had a constant routine, company and a busy life. In a huge plot twist, I got SA'd when I was overseas and I was too busy to process anything that had happened. A lot of bad things happened to me in my last unit that I swept under the rug and never dealt with.
 

 I'm 27 now and 5 months ago I got based in a big city, doing a more corporate job for the military. I quickly got settled, making friends and living my best life. Life was never better.
 

 Over the past four months, however, something in me has changed. The free time of this 9-5 posting means I come home and have time to think.
 

 I live alone in a flat and worry I will die alone. My chest and throat feel tight and I have panic attacks. Sometimes I worry that if I breathe out for too long, I won't be able to breathe in. This panic has trickled into most of my afternoons. My body tingles and aches and I feel so out of control.
 

 I enjoy my job and don't want to lose it because disclosing this to medics will make me non-deployable and that is the only thing that gives me routine and social life.
 

 I have to pretend to be strong, even when it trickles into my job. The other day, I tried to talk and words wouldn't come out of my mouth. This has never happened to me before and it scared me so much.
 

 I've decided to go for private counselling.
 

 Any words of reassurance? I could really use some kind words :("
"Hey there, I'm 25 (f) and gf is 24 
 We both deal with our mental struggles, she's always been there for me as I have her. Although a new behavior is making me really anxious and my anxiety about the situation is preventing me from being fully there for her. 
 

 Let me reiterate by saying our relationship is wonderful and extremely healthy, we've already talked about this with eachother. I'm just looking for advice for myself. 
 

 Lately she's been going through some mental struggles, and of course that can tend to effect your mood, but she's never been short with me like she has (and she's being short with everybody, not just me, I just notice it more because we spend the most time together). Which I know is completely normal, she's going through a lot in her family right now and I can only imagine how hard it is. But I get really stuck in my head and instead of letting her feel her feelings, I start feeling paranoid that she's upset with me or not talking to me because I said something etc. I don't want to feel that way, I want to be there for her. I just get in this mindset ""I don't act like that when I'm upset so why is she?"" But everyone is different and it's so incredibly selfish for me to even feel that way when she's going through what she is going through. I want to be the best partner and be supportive in every way that I can. When she snaps at me if I ask if she's ok for the 3rd time in 5 hours I tend to freak out a bit in my head. I don't want to. In no way do I want the attention on me, I truly hate that I feel this way. How can I be the best partner for my girlfriend going through a rough time?"
"I've struggled with social anxiety my entire life. Thankfully I've always been close with my cousins (we hang out, travel together, we're like a tight knit friend group) so I've never felt lonely and have been able to experience a social life. But I think being close with my cousins has also made me not wanna put myself out there as much as I should. 
 

 I know I'm still young but it sucks thinking about how I wasted most my teens and 20s not putting myself out there and creating new memories with diverse groups of people. I'm finally at a point where I'm actively exposing myself to social situations, but I wish I could've done this sooner. I'm at that age where a lot of my peers are starting to get married, have children, settle down, and all of this just makes it harder to make friends on top of my social anxiety. It's much easier to make friends when you're a college student in your late teens-early 20s, when most of your peers don't have many responsibilitie holding them down. 
 

 I'm just mourning all of the lost possibilities and ""what ifs"" of my youth I guess!"
"Hi everyone! 29F here. For some background info, I am currently taking 25mg zoloft and I see a therapist bi-weekly (for anxiety/depression/ocd and other things). I haven't had a panic attack in a long time, and 2 days ago I woke up at 6am in the middle of a full-fledged severe panic attack. It took hours to work through it and I ended up going in late to work (thankfully my boss was supportive). Since then I've been feeling physically like crap. I basically feel hungover or like I've had the flu or a stomach bug. I'm nauseous/woozy, dizzy, exhausted (almost fell asleep driving), I have the shakes, and I go back and forth between having the chills and being hot and sweaty. I'm trying to stay hydrated and eat, and im trying to take it easy. Does anyone have any suggestions or relate to this? I'm not necessarily in an extremely bad state, just feeling pretty poorly. I know its not unheard of, so I'm trying to curb my health anxiety by reminding myself that this is normal and I'm not dying or losing my mind🙃 tips are appreciated, or if anyone can relate and just wants to vent feel free! 💕💕"
"My (27F) bf (30M) of 7 months has anxiety, he used to take medication and he stopped recently. He knows I’ve never been married or pregnant before. However, i was talking with him about using nipples cream, and I said it’s usually used by pregnant women. He said so did you have a miscarriage? I said what? He said you were pregnant right? I said no? He said weren’t you married? I said no what are you talking about? He spent around a minute telling me that i was married. Anyways after that I felt his heart race for a few seconds then he said he was joking. It didn’t seem like it. Was that hallucination? And is it a symptom of anxiety? Or something that could happen after going cold turkey? I’m worried about him"
"Ill start by saying. I know i need professional help, I know i need exposure therapy and cbt. I know the things im doing right and wrong in healing myself from my traumas, anxieties, and bringing down those walls ive built for so many years. 
 

 This post is going to be a vent. A cry into the ghost in the machine. Whether anyone reads reacts or cares— thats another story. 
 

 My story starts with drugs. Lots of drugs. Lots of fun as a matter of fact. With people I love and bonded with for many years. Those days were of salad quality. I was awkward, but i had people who understood me, thought i was hilarious, smart, poetic, talented. 
 

 Well, those days are over. After a while, drugs became my friends. Because drugs were the only thing that allowed me to be present and engaged enough to HAVE FRIENDS. And i was self aware of that. So i decided to not fake myself anymore and just hang out out with my only “true” friend. Drugs. 
 

 Im now sober. 4 months. Just like i was for 4 years binging on anything i could get my hands on im miserable but now with no chemical help. And Im truly alone. 
 

 Hate fills my heart, im disconnected from love, from “god”. And i hurt. So fucking bad. I feel crooked and broken. I feel as if im being influenced by some horrible dark entity looming over my life making damn sure my love and my connection are stifled. Theres so much cognitive dissonance within me. And people FEEL IT. within 10 seconds of interacting with me. 
 

 I want to reach out, but I dont.
 

 I want to help people and make a positive impact on the lives around me, but i cant.
 

 I want to pursue hobbies and things i love (music, art, philosophy) but i have no motivation to do so.
 

 I want to die, but im scared to.
 

 I want to wake the fuck up. But i am so tired. 
 I am so tired. 
 

 Im 26m and i havent cried in so long. But today is my day to fucking cry"
"It's like a nervous reflex that's super hard to control, I've brought myself up to be like that to protect myself from rejection, so with girls I can't keep eye contact for even a second, even though I know she might be a little interested in me, I always think that she's misjudging me, that's brutal. And that's why I always try to appear as uninteresting as possible, but deep down inside I just wanted to at least try to say something, but my anxiety won't let me, and I don't know if that's good or bad because it could be that my anxiety be protecting me."
"Im 29M and I've been living with my brother for the past 6 years, I don't have a job but i want to get health insurance so i can go to an ophthalmologist and get a deep eye exam as i am having problems with my vision for many years. i also would like to start therapy for my anxieties, Is it possible to do this?

"Hi All,
 

 I've been sick this entire year, and I cannot figure it out. Due to rapid weight loss and inability to consume enough food, my doctor said I need to check into the hospital if this doesn't improve within a few weeks.
 

 When I first got sick in January, I was extremely anxious over a dating situation that didn't workout. This seemed to flare-up extreme symptoms (vomiting and inability to eat). I have had social anxiety that I thought I had gotten over around 2019, as I became very confident and made many new friends, but this incident seemed to bring it back full force.
 

 I thought the anxiety started to get under control over the spring, or was at least manageable to the point where I should no longer be perpetually extremely sick. I was diagnosed with Celiac disease in July, which seemed to be the answer.
 

 Now, here I am several months later and I've gotten worse with no clear outside stressor. The following symptoms are present:
 

 -Perpetual nausea, all felt where the stomach is located
 

 -Vomiting
 

 -Poor appetite. When I'm not feeling well, I cant even hold down water.
 

 There are more, all stomach discomfort related.
 

 My GI can't figure it out as I shouldn't be this sick from Celiac anymore, and suggested it could be anxiety and I ""may not even realize it."" The symptoms are relentless and I get virtually no relief. It's been debilitating for months where I can barely leave the house due to nausea. The thing is, I want to go out and do things, but physically am too sick.
 

 I do notice that I often feel ""on edge,"" so I know a general and perpetual anxiety disorder may be the issue.
 

 Has anyone had extremely debilitating nausea issues on a daily basis for this long? 
 

 Despite possible anxiety, I can still function for work and am not by any stretch psychologically debilitated. My mind is a bit cluttered, but if it's anxiety, it seems to be more ""subconscious.""
 

 I've also tried therapy, meditation, endless natural supplements, aromatherapy, and yet nothing seems to help the nausea. 
 

 I don't want to start the SSRI route unless I'm 99% sure I'm sick from anxiety and nothing else, as that's a rabbit hole and takes a long time to start working."
"I was bullied when I was younger and I've always had very high levels of social anxiety and self-doubt especially when I'm around girls my own age. Today I went to my college library to study, I always avoided going to areas where there are a lot of people. The library was full but I sat down at a big table and then I went to the bathroom and when I came back there were 3 girls at my table and oddly enough I didn't feel very unsafe, I used to start shaking my leg or looking at my the floor or perspiring or put my hand on my face or think about how ugly I am, but not today.
 

 This success is due to the fact that this last year I finally admitted that I have anxiety, I started sharing stories for the first time here on Reddit about myself and besides, my appearance has changed for the better since I got braces.
 

 I hope that in the future I can make friends, go to parties and get a girlfriend."
"Does anybody else have this problem? I'm pretty much glued to my phone for 12 hours a day to keep myself distracted (even though I think I might not need it as much now). My therapist is having me listen to affirmations for 21 days or whatever, and I think this might help with the negativity. But its hard and sometimes feels like its worse when lessening to them, often correcting what they are saying in my head. 
 

 Does anybody have anything they could say about these things?"
"Everything that has happen so far. With people I’ve encountered in my life like not anyone has ever told me they apologize for hurting me but I have to be here dealing with thinking and assuming everything is good when In reality it’s not.. but I see it’s time to accept how they will always view me and let go.. cause I just need redirect myself so i will be okay.. I shouldn’t have to feel bad for who I was back then cause who I am right now shouldn’t reflect me today.. 
 

 In my head"
I don't really talk much at work and I already feel so anxious. I don't want to go but I feel like it would be good for me. I just want to get blackout drunk.
"Hi all, 
 

 I will try to make the post as short as possible. 
 

 I suffer from what my psychiatrist calls recurrent ""moderate"" social Anxiety and followed by depression/low mood. My anxiety causes me to experince many social situations as very overwhelming and uncomfortable and I often feel the outcome from social situations as a defeating experinece, since the physical feeling of anxiety causes me to not be able to ping pong with people or give back when people cross my boundaries and that cause my overall satisfaction with life to go down, which causes depression, and the depression cause me to feel less happy when social and then I feel even more defeated, and the circle goes on....
 

 I first tried psychoanalysis. I was doing it for about 5 years, with minor breaks from it. I have now been trying CBT for around 7 month. I have tried mind body- therapy, breathwork and many other things. 
 

 I have been continuing to live my life in a somewhat normal way, meaning that I expose myself to social situation everyday and put myself out there (I also play live music), but it never seems to get any better. Now I am just unhappy in most of the situations. I also workout and eat healthy, drink less alcohol. Workouts seems to give me some relief, but unless I do it everyday the effects will go away quickly. And sometimes life dosn't allow me to work out every day. 
 

 Around december 2020 I started to realize, that maybe I need a change of ""brain chemicals"". I never liked the idea of antidepressants, so I started with ""natural"" supplements such as magnesium, Rhodiola Rosea, ashwagandha etc. And my desperation also led me to try cannabis products and psilocybin, which I dont really recommend. These ""drugs"" had a short term healing/relief, but nothing lasting. 
 

 I then decided to try anti depressants last december 2021, I was on Venlafaxine with very good results on my mood and anxiety, but had so much hair loss on it and it was dose dependent, so stopped. I then tried Setraline with very minor improvement, but a lot of sexual side effects. Some months ago I tried Trintellix which did nothing but give me sexual side effects. Some of the sexual side effects seems to be a bit too persistent for my comfort... I still have way less sex drive, even months after quitting. So I dont really wanna use SSRI/SNRI's again. 
 

 My psychiatrist prescribed me mirtazapine, which I didnt try yet...
 

 I am also looking into some Nootropics that might have less side effects. 
 

 I would love to try TMS, but where I live it is not a possibility unless I pay full price myself. 
 

 Is there anything else you guys can recommend me to try, a trype of therapy, non SSRI/SNRI drugs, other things ???  
 

 

 thank you so much"
"I had a job interview this morning for one of my first ""real"" jobs. I feel like it went well and I filled out the online application they sent me afterwards that had a bunch of tax-documents, etc. I'm hopeful that this will work out so I can finally leave my stupid retail job, but I ended up feeling really anxious for most of today thinking about the job; whether or not it's going to work out, if it's something I'll be underprepared for, if it's going to take up a lot of my time and energy, etc.
 

 I'm also supposed to send them a picture of my college diploma. I graduated about five years ago, and they sent me a diploma in the mail, which I put away somewhere and never looked at it again. I spent most of this evening turning over pillows and going through bookshelves trying to find the damn diploma, but no luck. I don't like stressed and anxious about a missing diploma, and I don't like the idea that something that inconsequential could make or break me getting hired for this job.
 

 TLDR. Job hunting is scary and makes me anxious"
"My life is good right now. I’m making 80k a year at a job I find fulfilling. I have three friends that I’m comfortable with and a pet that I love. I have more free time than I used to, and I’m mentally together enough to enjoy it. I feel the most content and peaceful that I have in my life.
 

 I’m terrified it won’t last. I’m terrified of losing my job, alienating my friends, going through another period of depression, losing my dog, the pandemic dominating our lives again, being arrested, heck, of my parents somehow finding me. I lose sleep by worrying at least twice a week and expect the worst of anything unexpected.
 

 Maybe I should mention that I got all these things fairly recently. I used to have my own business, but it went under due to the pandemic and I lost pretty much everything. I used to be a very guarded and antisocial person and pretty much assumed that my friends only cared about me for my status, but one of them helped me when I had nothing, and I’m very grateful for that, and to find out that some of my friends still wanted (and still want) to do with me. I know now that I have loyal friends. I got a new job, and got the dog after I moved out of my friend’s place because I realized that I don’t like living all by myself. It’s like I was so used to loneliness before that I didn’t realize there was an alternative. Honestly, even before the whole pandemic thing, though, I’ve always felt like good things don’t last.
 

 For right now, what I do is count my blessings each night. Today, things went well. Today, I had much to be thankful for. And if everything goes to Hell tomorrow, I can handle it. I’ve been through some difficult times before, and I’m strong enough to handle anything. That’s what I tell myself.
 

 I don’t know if this is something I should do something about or if my current system is okay. I guess I just wanted to get it off my chest."
I (28f) was on the pill about 4 years ago and suffered bad panic attacks and suicidal ideation. It was so bad that I stopped and eventually felt better after a few months. My gyno has hinted at trying birth control again but I'm super scared. My past experiences traumatized me pretty badly. Has anyone else experienced this or have any advice? Thanks.
"*\*\*sorry long post! I was up all night thinking about this!\*\**
 

 My parents would scold me when I was acting weird-- basically like a kid. I'm also the oldest sister so I had to have some kind of ""maturity"" but this basically lead me into being outcasted by other kids my age. For example, I was watching Cartoon Network and this really funny scene came up and I busted out laughing. They told me to stop laughing like that and the next day, Cartoon Network was blocked. 
 

 I was enrolled to this club where I started to play competitive tennis which I really enjoyed and even made some friends. Until one day my dad was telling me to stop hitting with them because they sucked at playing and it wasn't going to help me progress with my skills. At that time I didn't understand because I just played tennis for fun, I wasn't looking into going serious and those were my friends! We stopped going to the club and I lost contact with everyone there. I practiced with my dad and I didn't really enjoy it because it felt more like a chore rather than something fun. When I didn't perform well in practice, I would get punished like getting yelled at during the car ride home, grounded, silent treatment, tv/phone privileges were taken away, etc. 
 

 Fast forward to high school. I never really made friends because I couldn't relate to anyone or if I had met someone our friendship would never really progress because my parents were strict. I didn't even bother participating in any school/after school activities because I knew it was inconvenient for them to take me (they wouldn't even compromise). I didn't participate in any clubs because those required funds/activities unrelated to school and I already knew they would not be okay with it.
 

 I'm 26 years old now and my relationship with my parents are okay. I see the way they treat my brother and sister and let me tell you it was nothing like how they treated me. People would tell me to cut them some slack because maybe they didn't know what to do since they are first time parents. I don't really see how that's a reasonable excuse but okay I guess. Idk if they realized what they did to my childhood because I never really opened up to them about how I felt (and I don't plan to). But it just made me realize that when it's my turn to have kids I wouldn't want them to experience what I felt."

I’m a 26m and live with my fiancé and our two dogs. I had a job where I worked 50hr/week plus an additional 10hr drive time(hour there and hour back). I made alright money but wasn’t happy at all. Recently I just found out we’re expecting a child and although it made me the happiest I have been in a long time it put the pressure on. I found a new job 20min from home that I thought would be my out and after one day there I quickly realized it would only make my situation worse. I’m still in good standings with my old company but do not want to go back and only have enough money in savings for another months worth of bills. I’m desperately looking for a new career but my anxiety makes it feel like I can’t breath sometimes. Does anyone have any similar experiences with this type of anxiety? I just want to be a great dad and I already feel like I’m failing.
"I'm 26 years old and today I had my last college exam (it went well), I've always had social anxiety but lately I've been getting better.
 

 Briefly, when I was catching the bus there was a group of 3 teenagers, I look very young but my jaw is too deep and I've always been bullied for it in the past. I walked past and 2 girls looked at me and then I turned around and stood still, all of a sudden I hear ""boy in black"" (I was dressed in black) but I wasn't sure, then I hear them getting closer behind my back and I felt they were scared or embarrassed then I take a slight look back and they squealed in embarrassment but I kept to myself, then they just stand there looking at me and in profile and she says I was ugly.
 

 I don't want to have anything to do with younger girls but that situation only made me revisit the ghosts of the past, my anxiety doesn't allow me to solve basic situations of misunderstanding, I always seem ignorant, I feel too insecure to open my mouth, precisely the mouth manipulated by my mandible, I think that only surgery will resolve these insecurities of mine.
 

 Edit 1: I may not have explained it very well, but she probably saw me walking from the front, I have a very symmetrical face, the typical babyface and many times girls saw me from the front and thought I was attractive and then when they wanted to meet me they saw the my jaw and they didn't like it and to vent the frustration they called me ugly, this has happened MANY times to me in the past."
"I want to start this post with apologizing for my bad English. I was born in the Kurdish part of Iraq, during the war we fled to Sweden. No matter how hard I try to remember, I have absolutely no memories of my childhood, neither good or bad even though I was 9 years old when we fled Iraq. The only thing I know is that I lived and was raised by my grandparents ( fathers side ) before I was taken away by 2 strangers that supposed to be my parents. The reason to why my grandparents took care of me was because of my parents fought all the time, I really mean fought according to my grandparents my father broke my mothers nose and arm several times and because my mother couldn’t do anything back she started to protest by refusing to breastfeed me and throwing me out of the house even tough I was a infant. I was then taken away from the only 2 people in the world that cared for me. I have lived with anxiety and panic attacks since I was 13 years old, today I am 29. I tried to talk with my father about 2 years ago and asked why they did all the things they did to me, “ we did our best, our childhood wasn’t better than yours “ that’s exactly what he answered. Today I have no one, I mean absolutely no one. Sure my so called mother and father are alive but they are just two strangers to me. My grandparents are not with us anymore, well my grandmother is but she is so old and unwell. There is not a single night I don’t cry myself to sleep I’ve cried every night since 2002, I’m really not exaggerating i have cried every single night since 2002. I have never worked 1 day in my life, I’ve been a criminal my whole life. I’ve been in and out of jails since I was 17 years old, there is nothing I haven’t done except murder and rape. I know it’s not an excuse to say that it was my parents fault because it wasn’t, I choose this path I’m not trying to make it sound logical or right I’m just trying to say that I’m so extremely tired of that tough guy attitude and that criminal lifestyle because that’s not me. I’m not tough, far from it. I hate being a criminal and hurting people, I regret every day of my life. I always feel like I’m under water, I can’t breathe but at the same time I never pass out or die. There is absolutely nothing wrong with Sweden it’s a wonderful country but for me it’s a prison. Not because of the country or people itself but because of all the memories and because my parents choose this place, Sweden will always be the thing that replaced my grandparents. I wish I could move to another country but I have absolutely nowhere to go and no one to go to, I’m all alone."
"Hey y’all!
 This morning I’m getting a procedure done to remove my pilonidol cyst, it will be done in office under local anesthesia. I have GAD, CPTSD, and ocd so as you can imagine I’m nervous.
 Which would be better for this type of situation, I’m having a hard time picking.
 My propranolol helps calm my body down but not really my mind, and hydroxyzine might make me sleepy.
 Thanks in advance!"
I (M28) have noone I can tell without embarrassing myself I hope here someone understands me because today I had a presentation at uni and I had to talk for only five minutes or something. When I stood Infront of the class I got soo extremly nervous that if I wanted to talk I couldn't. I just excused myself and said I was very open about because what else do you want to say besides I am so fucking nervous. So I don't know what to do with this bullshit desease because we got the next two presentations for January and I just can't anymore. I am in a major where talking is necessary and I worked so hard to get here. I am basically a fully functioning human being but one thing I can't shake is nervousness in public speaking has this ever happened to anyone else? Hell I even like to party from time to time but this makes me embarrassed I can't put it into words the amount of shame I feel especially at my age
"Hi all,
 

 I am 27 years old and I am alone for many years. I used to live with my parents until 22 and they were the only people I see apart from few friends that I met once or twice in a year. I am now 27 and for the last 5 years, I live in another city and I am completely alone; only seeing people at the office 2-3 days a week and meeting with my childhood friends again once or twice in a year. 0 relationships in my whole life, my first kiss came 2 months ago in an absurd way which I posted here (still virgin). And I have social anxiety, I really hate meeting new people, finding something to talk with new people is one of the biggest challenges for me. With my close friends I am the most talkative and funny guy but with new people, I am all quiet.
 

 Anyway, as briefly mentioned above I had a brief interaction with a girl and due to my inexperience, social anxiety and general stupidity, I mess everything up and even though she was the one approaching me, I failed to have a relationship. I was basically like a plant for the last 2 months, nothing gave me joy, I just walked long hours as staying at home made me feel depressed and I could not concentrate into anything.
 

 Now, I am still not that good and think about this girl almost all the time but I feel much better because I came to a realization when I was reading a sort of sad Tweet about how we are all lonely and we might die alone. After the events with this girl, I used to start crying after reading such sad stuff. But that time, **I just thought, I can't be sad about this all the time, even if I will be alone my whole life and could possibly die alone as a virgin, it is not the end of the world.** After saying this to myself, I suddenly felt proud of me to ignore such sad stuff after a highly sensitive period.
 

 And this thought brought me back to life (partly). It is closer to a religious thought like god is testing you with something (such as sickness, disability or unemployment etc.), it is your test and you must bear with it. I do not have any religion so I do not believe that test stuff but personally. I would also like to note that I am not *advising* anything as this is highly subjective.
 

 But when I thought, my finances could be considered as great thanks to my parents and I have never seen poverty, I have no known health issues and I am trying to lose weight, I have a house and a car, I managed to visit and study abroad, I have a job with a great income, I finished law school and did masters and I am able to survive by myself one way or the other. **Since so much could have gone worse for me in the life, I am ready to accept social anxiety and loneliness as my destiny and live my whole alone. If loneliness is written for me in the future, so be it.**
 

 I know this sounds depressing and like giving up trying to change for the better and I agree, this is submissive. But still, this though made me the happiest in the last two months and I can function as before."
"It's not even particularly stressful events or activities either. Sometimes it's just normal stuff or a personal project and I'll start to feel this build up of stress till I finally reach a point where I don't want anything to do with it and even just thinking about it makes my chest tighten up. 
 

 For example I've been working on a painting for my grandma as a Christmas gift for quite a few months now. I chose to do it of my own free will. When I first started, it wasn't so bad. I even enjoyed it to an extent. But recently it's like it's slowly been weighing on me. I finally finished the picture a few days ago but now I have to get it framed and it's like every fiber of my being wants to be done and rid of it. Every little hiccup feels overwhelming. Doesn't help that I'm starting to run out of time(I'm sure this is a huge part of it since I don't feel like I can take a break from it and it's starting to look like I'm going to have to step out of my comfort zone to get it done). I know it's not a huge deal but it just feels like a lot. I'm sure my tolerance for stress has greatly diminished since my anxiety has gotten worse over the years but it's sad that even something like this, that's supposed to be fun and heartwarming, is setting it off so easily."
"I (25F) have been having a rough time with health anxiety lately related to gynecological matters. I’m trying to calm myself, but it’s really difficult. Does anyone have any advice?"
"Is it normal to feel worried all the time? I want to emphasize ***all the time***.
 

 All the things I'm going to explain are worse when night comes, much much worse.
 

 I feel in **danger** all the time, it doesn't matter where I am this feeling doesn't disappear.
 

 When I get sick I think I'm going to die, not joking, literally I think that. It doesn't matter if it's just cold in my mind I have cancer or something like that and that will leave my family alone without my support, in my job I always think I will be fired in any moment.  
 When I'm at supermarket, when I'm driving I always feel and think the worse. I tired, that fucking chest pain is terrible.
 

 And that's not enough, those thoughts and feelings trigger more and worse thoughts and feeling that I can not control 'em. Please from the bottom of my heart tell me something to be a better person, I want to fix this behavior.
 

 I'm 25 male, no friends, no father figure."
I held on to memories and a bond I thought mattered when all it showed each time that.. I shouldn’t have put myself in that position to care for someone that much. That is more than capable of hurting me and not giving damn about how I felt..only themselves.. I cried my tears but all it’s ever showed me that they didn’t deserve me in there life my past might of ruined you.. but who I am now shouldn’t reflect that. If you see the old me respectfully don’t even say anything to me.. because I know what I deserve and I deserve someone to keep it 💯 whether it’s good or bad and wouldn’t leave just cause of none sense. I honestly do hope you get what you dish out..
"Is there any merit to this fear. I'm just thinking about where this anxiety is exactly, and that the reserves might be all charge for a big episode or something. 
 

 Is this just paranoia?"
As the title says. It doesn't make me feel good because I can't do anything with 0 friends or family in another country.
I give people chance after chance just to get always disappointed I’m hurt but I wish we was adults about everything but all we did was argue about everything that happened instead of talk I just wish it wasn’t this way but I gotta be stronger than my own emotions because all it’s ever done was get me hurt… he was deadass the only person I legit was comfortable with but I can only say so much… because it doesn’t matter anymore..
"I moved a good 45-50 minutes away from my job because I had to. I tried to keep it going, but found myself paying more for gas than I was making traveling to work. Also, my boss became very stressed at me and had threatened to fire me on a couple of occasions. Yesterday, I found out the only way I could get to work was through Uber (car tires became deflated) I decided I am done. I decided it was unfair to them to only be able to attend on a limited schedule as well as unfair to me, having to spend my money on ubers and gas and having little to no money at the end of the week. I have been out of my mind anxious about being unemployed although I have been looking very rigorously even before quitting. I feel bad for quitting on the spot, although I was getting so stressed about the driving and money I woke up one morning and seriously contemplated hurting myself as an excuse to not attend. Woke up this morning pretty anxious, hopefully I work things out."
"My (26F) mom (58F) has an a lot of anxiety and depression. She started taking omega3 supplement to help her.
 

 Today she said to me ""you should take some too. Its good for the brain. Like me you are missing something up there""
 

 I know she is referring to my anxiety. (I'd say my anxiety is of medium intensity).
 

 I know anxiety disorders are real illnesses. But i dont consider myself sick. I have a different brain chemistry that i need to take care of carefully but i certainly am not ""missing something up there"". That made me upset.
 

 Do you consider yourself sick?"
"Does anyone else is Hyper Aware of their body and feeds up their anxiety? Like any small change, sensation, or get scared of things that probably were there before but notice now?"
"I'm sitting here looking at a chat on my discord, with people I don't know, thinking that I wish my life wasn't this way, I'm sure my former bullies from the past would be pleased to know that I became someone so lonely, isolated and that I would never ever have a girlfriend. Who would have thought looking back at the way I envisioned this going to happen.
 

 Anyway, I want to radically change myself because I have no alternative, I can't kill myself and my life won't just end out of nowhere, but I don't know where to start either, I've thought about starting to make videos on TikTok, make friends on Discord but I feel weird for bothering, going to Omegle but people just want to troll, starting playing Valorant to interact with girls and simply sharing my photo here on Reddit on r/rateme to feel more ""valid"". I've even thought about emigrating to another country, because I feel that my parents undermine my self-isolation behavior and because the country where I live (Portugal) is old and it's very difficult to make friends with young people."
"For context I’ve had a number of traumatic experiences growing up and have suffered with anxiety for a while (depression a very long time ago). I’ve been seeing a therapist for the last four years who has helped me loads to manage it. I met my husband back in 2019 and was just blown away by his funniness, kindness, generosity and looks and we gelled together so well. I love him to pieces however I first experienced anxiety when I moved out from my toxic household and moved in with him, I was constantly doubting our relationship and love for him and it killed me. 
 

 This eventually stopped when I moved out for uni and completed my last year, everything felt perfect with him again. When I moved back I remember thinking in the first few weeks how much of a fairytale our relationship felt and just felt so in love with him however when September came I got hit by the same anxiety. It is crippling me, affecting our intimacy and I just don’t know what to do. Is my anxiety trying to tell me something? I love him so much and it just feels like life is incapable of letting me be happy. I feel like I’m going to lose him and his beautiful healthy family I’ve become a part of and I just don’t know what to do. It’s been months and I still feel anxious about everything, I just want it to end and not lose him in the process. Has this happened to anyone else?? Any advise on how to stop it :("
"Does anyone else still look for more answers even after the doctors told them everything is fine? had a clean head MRI, Clean Cervical MRI, Clean head CT Scan, Clean EEG test, 2 doctors, 1 neuro, neuro reffered me to a psychiatrist. But it is so hard to believe that all my physical symptoms are related to anxiety."
"Hello there, (27m with ADD)
 

 A few months ago I had this really bad night where I could not fall asleep because I had this constant feeling of having to go pee. Now I've had this happen before but usually I sleep well the next day and it doesn't happen for months.
 

 Sadly this time was different and it kept on happening every single night... I would not sleep for at least 2 nights in a row and the the third night I would be so exhausted that I'd sleep like a baby. First thing that came to mind is that I might have a UTI and I need to see a doctor so I did. She checked my blood and urine and everything was fine. Another week of almost no sleep went by and the doctor told me to go see a urologist in the hospital. After a couple of tests it was clear that everything was fine and I was as healthy as I could be.
 

 After a few weeks of searching for answers on the internet I ended up with a somewhat of a diagnosis. In the end it happens to be anxiety that is causing this constant pressure on my bladder. I would say that I'm happy that it was anxiety but I'm not. I'm having to constantly tell myself that my bladder is fine and I'm all good. At least this way the pressure goes away for a while and it is manageable. Now because of all the bad nights of sleep I ended up creating a sleep anxiety where I get really anxious around bed time. I absolutely hate going to bed now because I never know if I'm going to sleep or not.
 

 My body gets so hot when I get anxious and I feel my heart rate going up. When that happens I'm just completely awake and all the feelings of tiredness are gone.
 

 Now I've learned a trick or two to at least get some of the anxiety away. I know that I need to grab a book and distract myself so the feeling can go away. I know that I need to tell myself that everything is fine and that it is not the end of the world is I can't sleep. Sure they help and they make sure that I at least get a couple of hours of sleep instead of none.
 

 The thing is I used to be such a good sleeper, I could go to bed at any time and get myself to sleep like it was nothing. Now its just one big struggle and it is really making my life difficult. I work in construction and I usually have to wake up at like 4:30AM. Sleeping only 2 hours a night is just exhausting combined with a hard labor job.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 I would love to visit a therapist but they are all booked full for months and it's just not really going to happen anytime soon.
 

 Now after this long as story the question really is like how do you deal with this?Do you have some advice for me or things that worked for you?"
I’m letting them go all they’ve ever done was effect every part of my life. Made me question my worth and etc and who I am today all I wanted was for you to have an permanent place in my life but all you’ve showed me that you will always be temporary and I don’t need that anymore. I do wish u nothing but the best but it’s time for me to do no contact because I feel like it’s for the best and I need to break this cycle. 🔄
Thanks
"For context I (26f) have had quite a traumatic upbringing, surrounded by toxic family and extended family members, monstrous exes who were all kinds of abusive, a mother who was constantly sectioned growing up etc. I had never known a healthy relationship until I started seeing a councillor a couple years ago and made more better friendships. I met my now husband (30m) in 2019 and things were great but I was constantly anxious and waiting for something terrible to happen, he always proves me wrong however treating me with love, patience and understanding.
 

 However since moving in with him I find myself so anxious and it feels like I’ve gone into self sabotage mode. Everything is perfect and he is just perfect but something just feels off and I’m so anxious that I’m going to lose him. Like sometimes I wonder if it’s just because I’m not used to living in an environment that is not argumentative, explosive and puts me in survival mode that life just feels boring?
 

 I’ve been anxious and triggered since September constantly worries that I’m going to end the relationship or that I’m going to lose him and his healthy family and I don’t know why? I’ve communicated everything with him and he only shows me love and understanding which makes it worse somehow. I felt like everything was going okay but last week my mum was sectioned and admitted into hospital and I’m not sure if that has made me feel worse. Seeing her reminds me of my old life and it’s made me feel so distant from my partner and I hate it. I just feel like something is wrong but when I’m not anxious I know everything is fine. I just feel like I’m not cut out for this and should just be alone because I’m incapable of being happy but I love him so much and don’t want to lose him. Has anyone else felt like this? How have you overcome it?"
"So does anyone feel old ? Like I'm 25 but I feel old idk 
 Like I'm going to have a heart attack or just die .. maybe I'm depressed cause I don't feel my self u no . I feel like everything around me is just boring. Life is getting boring . I'm fed up . Not arsed to do things. 
 Then on top of things I keep getting this feeling that I'm just going to die at anytime even tho I'm perfectly healthy... And I'm cool with it but then I don't want to die if you get me .. idk brains kinda scrambled at moment. This post probably doesn't make sense but anyone feel like this ? Or am I the only one"

"A my old workplace, there were some people who I didn't know how to say no to and let them take advantage of me because of me being a people pleaser. I guess eventually this person actually believed (or they were still trying to take advantage of me in a way) and wanted to keep in contact. I tried giving hints that I couldn't keep in touch as much a they wanted to and I eventually ended up blocking their number. Even though they were a piece of shit person (took advantage of me, mocked me, humiliated me, etc.) I still feel bad for ghosting them. I guess half of it is that I feel ashamed for not having the guts to just tell them off like a normal person and half of it is that the way I went about it is not the right thing to do and I feel bad for people despite their actions towards me.
 

 It's been about two years now and while it's gotten better I still feel bad about it from time to time. Just wanted to vent a bit."
"Are they the same thing? I don’t know what I’m experiencing. I recently have started having these mini “panic attacks”
 

 Usually, it is related to my health anxiety. I will feel a sensation in my body and I fear it is a sign of one of my feared illnesses, and will get heart palpitations, tremors, dizziness and shortness of breath. It takes a while to go away but I can still semi-function. 
 

 I am talking to the doctor about this on Thursday, and I want to explain it to her in the best way possible."
"I’m so ashamed of how behind I am in life and how immature and dependent and lazy I am. But here it is: I live at home, work part time (work reduced my hours), am taking one class at a local college (all I can pay for), and am applying for more part time work at other places. I live in Cleveland, so the rent is super high but still not cheap. I pay my mom 500 a month but that is it. 
 

 My mom doesn’t work herself but does get alimony from her ex, my father (they split up 10 years ago, and we are pretty estranged), and her parents (my grandparents, who I am also not close to because they are devout Jehovah witnesses) pay for her/our rent. The $500 I pay actually covers rent for this big store front-turned-storage-unit with a bunch of stuff from our old house that my mom intends to sell but it’s been many many years (10+).
 

 I also obviously pay for any personal things like my clothes/money to go out. I also paid my tuition for one class at a local college. she still pays for my groceries and phone. I’m so embarrassed. 
 

 She doesn’t want me to move out because she says I’m incapable of functioning and I’m trying to prove both of us wrong. I do housework, try to clean up after both of us, help her whenever I can, but I’m still basically a child and I hate myself for being so behind. 
 

 I’m grateful, don’t get me wrong, but I’m incredibly ashamed of what it says about me that I am where I am in life.
 

 What am I doing wrong? Should I quit school? Should I just try to find better/more work? Or is it stupid to work shitty jobs without a degree. Should I get independence or a degree first?"
"Does anyone have like extreme health anxiety. 
 I could be just sitting at home and il get a tingling feeling in my face and I'm like . It's happening I'm having a stroke . Then u freak out for a few mins ... 
 

 Or when your on fb or tictok etc u see someone with cancer and there like oh if u have these symptoms you may have cancer and then a day later u get one of the said symptoms and ur just like shit might have cancer then u freak out .. could go on but I think u get the picture...... 
 

 Fuckin sucks"
"Me and my husband currently live in a really expensive city. We basically both work full time to barely make ends meet and live pay cheque to pay cheque. Recently my husband lost his job which gave me a bit of a reality check. It’s a bit of a long story but we are looking at moving back to my home town so we can save money and get more stable jobs.
 

 My anxiety has gotten a lot worse in the last few years. Even though this move is something that would really help us, I feel like if I move back to this city it means we are huge failures, and taking a step backwards. 
 

 I feel like if I go back, I would only really want to go back to my old job I had before. The job interview itself is stressing me out. But I also feel like all my old coworkers will judge me and kind of laugh at me behind my back that I had to come back cause I couldn’t afford the city I moved to. 
 

 I had a good time in the city I currently live in, and I feel like I worked really hard to build a life here, only to be pushed out because everything is so expensive. I get so many mixed feelings about the move, one minute I’m excited, the next minute I want to cry. How do I have a more stable and positive outlook?"
"I've been slowly improving my anxiety over the last few months but honestly I think my life so far (I'm 26 years old) has been completely wasted. This has never been what I wanted for myself, I've been looking at Discord chats for 3 hours thinking how great it would be if I didn't think 30 times before typing something, and then I never know what to say for people to like me and think I'm funny, that's why I never type anything. If I can't write to strangers, how can I stand to go into Discord rooms, talk and try to make friends, and I'm always afraid that I have minors and then they'll think I'm ""creepy"".
 

 Talking face to face is literally impossible for me because I always try to look uninteresting and I can't fake a smile, I have to face reality, I'm a failure, I finished college now, I only made one friend at first but he dropped out after 3 months, I always avoided talking to people, I couldn't make presentations in front of the class, and even when I was approached by beautiful girls I always ignored it, I never had a girlfriend because my biggest fear is being rejected and humiliated because of my jaw, and now I don't know what to do because my parents are already 60 years old and I'm way behind everyone else my age and younger, I'm going to start working in the next few months and I'm alone, I've never in my life approached a girl to date me, moreover, I have never approached a girl to be my friend just so you guys can see how long I've been a retard.
 

 I don't think there hasn't been a day so far that my anxiety hasn't affected my decisions so it's only natural that in the future it will continue to affect regardless of my effort. So I think I lost to anxiety."
"Hi everyone,
 

 I’m 27F and I have a doctors appointment tomorrow and I am very worried about it. I have had this doctor since birth.
 

 I went 6 weeks ago about twitching, that symptom improved a lot, but is still there. I was worried about ALS, but the doctor said it probably wasn’t that.
 

 Now, I have other symptoms. I have heartburn like chest pain, a strong heartbeat that I can feel, especially after exercise, or when anxious. It’s stronger than usual. Also have tremors and dizziness when anxious. 
 

 I am so worried she is going to someone link these symptoms to ALS, because of the twitching I had.
 

 Anyone have any support or tips for me?"
"Not sure if anyone else here experiences this. But I seem to experience some sort of severe career selection anxiety, when choosing between 2 specific careers.
 

 I am 29 years old, I have an undergrad degree in a field that did not work out for me. (I took several years GAP to travel + COVID caused some delay).
 

 I now seem to experience a frequent anxiety deciding between attending medical school or a career in computer science. Maybe this all sounds silly but. I honestly love both. I had thought I was done with medicine but the feeling that I should pursue it keeps resurging.
 

 Well now this indecisiveness is feeling crippling, because I am stuck between two choices where choosing both as i would love, is not possible (due to the gruelling nature of medical school).
 

 Sorry, this maybe does not sound so serious to many people, but for some reason I feel a genuine physical tightness and anxiety over resolving this issue. There is so much on my mind as I weight pros and cons and try to make a decision (finances, future salary, future dating/find a spouse). And even when I finally rest on a decision (as i did 3 months ago) this same feeling of indecisiveness seems to spring up again out of nowhere and now the cycle repeats.
 

 Please help, how can I just move forward without this crippling anxiety and inability to choose something and stick with it in my life."
"Since I was very young, girls had very strange attitudes towards me, they were either very nice or extremely unpleasant, there was no middle ground. Later, when I realized that it was because I looked very young that they liked it, but because my jaw was turned in, they felt repulsed. I gained an irrational fear of being rejected from a very young age because I hated hearing laughter or jokes regarding my jaw.
 

 This was the main cause of my anxiety with girls being so high, therefore, I have never in any period of my life (I'm 26 years old) approached any girl, all the conversations I've had with girls, not counting those of circumstance, they were the ones who approached me and of course I felt very nervous because at first they ended up laughing and making jokes about my appearance, but with the friendliest ones I always felt alert.
 

 I only had one girl friend (she approached me) 13 years ago, and so I feel incapable and attacked every time I say ""be confident"" and ""girls are normal people"". If you only knew how many times I've been approached by beauties and I've ignored them because the thought of turning around and saying something makes me itchy and paralyzed, like they even bother to start the conversation and I ignore it, I'm such a loser ."
"I want to go out with friends but my SA is in the way. I have way too strong physical symptoms. 
 I can't relex fully in social situations and I can only see that time spent with friends as good times in retrospective. I feel so disconnected with people. I don't know if I will ever get over this. 
 I think a lot about living as a monk since I am really into Buddhism."
"I've been dealing with chronic nausea for about a year. Around July, my GI did an endoscopy and identified Celiac Disease which seemed to explain the nausea and stomach discomfort.
 

 Yet, after 6 months of a very strict gluten free diet, I feel sicker than before. Recent bloodwork and CT scan showed nothing.
 

 I have had nausea and vomiting from anxiety before, but this time feels different as it has persisted for longer than ever.
 

 I'd say about 2 or so days a week I have anxiety and it's just persistent in the background. I feel ""calm"" on the surface but feel this deep rooted anxiety in my gut. I do meditation over 30 minutes per day, take Ashwagandha and lavender supplements (as needed for lavender), and have been to therapy before as I initially thought the nausea was solely due to anxiety.
 

 What's strange is that I'll go to sleep feeling fine, and wake up without any noticeable bit of anxiety, but I'm very nauseous and feel it all where my stomach is located (below mid chest cavity and down to below the left rib cage). I continue to have crippling nausea for at least 48 hours where I can't hold much of anything down.
 

 Whenever I vomited from anxiety, I could feel the nerves run through my body, but I haven't felt that any time I've vomited over the last few months.
 

 My GI is ruling a lot of things out and is pushing the anxiety angle as the root cause. I honestly don't know, I wish I could easily point to anxiety and just treat it more aggressively.
 

 If I have anxiety for a day or two, can that result in brutal nausea for the following 3 or so days even if I have no noticeable anxiety? From what I've read from other posts, that does not seem to be the case.
 

 Please help here, my quality of life is awful right now and can't leave the house due to nausea!
 

 Only medication I take is for my gut called donnatal. I've tried zofran, reglan, famitodine, and nothing helps the nausea!"
"But I am 27.So,due to the brain having been fully developed by 25,is it impossible/very hard to change my personality after 25?"
"I have GAD, but I also have health worries. Do I have both Illness Anxiety Disorder (health anxiety) and GAD, or just GAD. I worry about health, but also work, friendships, etc?"
"Lately these past few days, or maybe weeks, I (25F) feel like losing myself from crippling anxiety.
 

 I've struggled with anxiety ever since I was in elementary school, but only after I got into college I started knowing what to call what I feel that causes me to vomit at the slightest thought of dying. I used to get extreme panic attacks during college, but now I don't get it as much or as extreme as it did. But lately, I've been unable to sleep on time at night, there are days where I have no appetite but some I eat so much I almost vomited, I get anxious from not being able to sleep and everything's just messing up my brain. 
 

 I have not been able to afford professional help as it's very expensive where I am and I don't have the money or luxury to afford one. I feel scattered, my brain has been weird too.. like, here as I'm writing this post I'm feeling anxious about my health and my mental, my mind is thinking about alot of things and I look like I'm rambling. Speaking of the anxiety, my symptoms in the past used to be feeling out of breath, palpitating, stomachache, nausea or even vomiting, hyperventilating and just straight up feeling dreadful. Now, these past few days, things are a little bit different, not sure if it's my anxiety evolving (LOL) or what, but first I'll be having that classic out of breathlessness, then I'll feel dizzy, nauseous. heart racing like a galloping horse, feeling dreadful, then my brain would be UN-concentrating itself. If I talk I'm gonna sound like a dumb and dumber. 
 

 I've also been sick a lot these days, which I'm not used to in the past (I used to be pretty fit and don't get sick easily) like, back then when everyone else was sick, I was fine. Now I would be the first person to get sick pretty bad and it would take a long time to heal. This month I got sick with some sore throat and cough, it healed after about 3 weeks but my acid refluc might spark it up again.. though hopefully not. I also been having lots of acid reflux too, when I usually don't.. which might be a proof of how bad my stress has been currently. I feel like I just want to talk to people whenever I get my anxiety flare ups, but truth is, my boyfriend (27M) is not that type of person to talk about mental problems and such because it somehow would piss him off and I'll only get told, ""don't say that, don't say that you're like that,"" or suggesting that I sleep or do something so that the feeling passes. I get where it comes from like a man thinks differently and that's how he deals with all the 'feelings' business or whenever he's feeling anxious or down he'd just listen to music.
 

 But him and I are different, and all I needed was someone who would listen to me and comfort me when I'm having that moment (this exhausting, crippling anxiety) like, I just wanted some kindness. Like this one time I had extreme anxiety attack when I lived at my stepmother's house, my stepaunt helped calmed me down, I was awoken from my sleep abruptly from it and she told me to sleep with her, talk to her, and when it happened again during some random evening, she told me to come talk with her in her room, just chilling and feeling the surrounding. I can't explain what I felt from that exactly but, it was kind, it was gentle, it was comforting, it was her accepting a person with such a flaw, there was no judgement or no telling me what to do. Although she did asked me to come talk with her but, it is in no way the same as what my BF did. But then again they are 2 different people, then 2 different ways of dealing with such thing. While with my friends, well, I don't have that many friends.. I have one friend that I consider close but, I don't think it's the situation between me and her now. So I barely spoke to her now, let alone about how I feel during all this. Last but not least, my family, they're pretty much.. not ignorant, but, since I was 2 decades apart from my youngest older brother, it made it hard for them to relate or understand my experience, and my sister in laws can be pretty cruel sometimes. So, this is a bit lonely. 
 

 I wish I had the means to afford a professional help, I mean, I'm working and by that I've a small business run together with my boyfriend- forgot to mention that he's not a bad guy, just that he's got little knowledge about it and how to deal with it, or how to help someone who's dealing with it. I've a small business but, of course the money's not enough just yet to afford continual sessions of therapy. Gosh.. I was even thinking of getting some chill pills but, still thinking of the side effects I would get if I were to get some medication without a doctor's prescription. I just.. I don't know, I feel disgusting you know. Heck, I even hit myself for falling sick with bad cough and when my hair tangles as I brush it. Has anxiety this bad ever happened to anyone? What should I do, for now, while I'm saving the money to get professional help? 
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Ps. Healthcare me no have, because it's expensive and it's just.. the monthly HC bill is more expensive thatnmy monthly grocery sometimes."

"My mum has retinitis pigmentosa, which is an illness that causes a person to lose their eyesight gradually.

"[30F]And painful situation I am going through. I have been struggling with social anxiety since 2019. Prior to that I was doing well. I always had a very mild case of anxiety but idk what happen that has progressed and i had been coping with Alcohol but this year i decided to stop and had made some improvements. On November i started a new job at a restaurant as a hostess my sister took me to where I was doing well in the beginning. I had been nervous and awkward but nothing too crazy. Then like weeks later this one guy that is super handsome works there has made me freeze up and panic to the point where you can tell on my body language. I wasn’t sure why because I don’t care for handsome men. I usually date normal guys because I am not that superficial. But slowly he started to act weird around me too like if I made him nervous because I was acting nervous.
 

 I then somehow have fallen for this guy hard I cant get him off my mind. I am not that ugly myself but I could never approach him I am not a fan of dating at work and I want something long term.
 

 

 This is is where I need your help. Its gotten so bad we both can obviously not handle it anymore and I had a panic attack and I just feel terrible he has been working there for years I feel as I should leave the job. Thing is everyone else loves me there the managers are begging me not to leave that they will give me time. I told them I suffer from anxiety and that is why i am quitting but they do not want me to.
 

 This situation has just brought my self esteem to the floor to have this beautiful man see me crumble right before him every time. I dont know if I should stay or leave. Stay face my fears or suffer yet another traumatizing panic attack and make his job uncomfortable yet again. Ughhh it makes me cringe thinking about it"

"I've been dealing with OCD, Depression and Anxiety for 11 years. Every year I organise to go visit my dad after Christmas to stay for a few nights. I had to cancel a few years ago and I'm feeling like I have to cancel this year as well.
 

 My mental and physical health issues are even worse than they were a couple of years ago and I'm really struggling to cope at the moment. I was able to stay at my dads last year so it's good I was able to do that.
 

 We've organised for me to come visit tomorrow but I don't feel like I'm able to do it. So I'll have to cancel tonight but I feel awful about cancelling on plans like this. I know my young brothers, my dad and my step mum will be disappointed. My mind is trying to convince me to force myself to go but I don't feel like I'm physically able to. How do I not feel bad about cancelling plans?
 

 I'm so sick of this. I'm 26 and was hoping I would be able to improve things over the last couple of years but they've become worse."
"Two weeks or so into my relapse of health anxiety and at this point in just frustrated... I've gone to the ER and had a million workups done and alls good. I'm 27 and my brain needs to understand all these random pains or twitches or feelings aren't gonna kill me. If I have a bad day or I'm dizzy or sore or something, guess what? I still wake up the next day. I guess that's why it's a disorder because no matter how much you realize you're fine your brain just won't stop. These weird arm pains or numbness and chest pains are probably because of how screwed up the muscles in the back of my neck and shoulders are from constantly worrying about nothing. The stupid part is originally I was set off thinking I had a problem in my brain and by the time I was out of the hospital I was fixated on my heart like always because my BP was a bit high, of course it's high cmon brain you're freaking me out all the time lol. I don't know what my brain wants from me, I don't want to be anxious I've done what I can to ensure my health and the doctors tell me I'm okay, that's all I can do; but my anxiety still tries to mess with me from the shadows everyday. Super lame. At this point it just makes me frustrated because I'm smart and it makes me feel stupid to worry about this stuff for no good reason."
"I was diagnosed with GAD 8 years ago. But ever since the pandemic started, I've been working from home for the last 3 years... I've been 3 fucking years basically locked in my room, I don't even leave my room much. I only go out to eat and shower, and I only leave my house to see my girlfriend a couple of days a week but we don't go out either, we spend time together watching movies at her house.
 

 I can say that I slept from 6 to 8 hours and from 10 am to almost 2 am I sit in front of my computer, I work for 6 hours and then I play almost all the rest of the day also I fap a lot wich I think just fucking toast my brain sometimes sex feels numb, emotions are not as bright as i recall them. I try to exercise (in my room), to read, to make a side hustle or learn someting new but I am not consistent.
 

 Honestly after all this time I can see how my general and mental health is getting worse every day, I used to be grateful for every day, for taking care of myself and even before 2020 I can say that I was not sedentary at all I used to move a lot, running, lifting, hiking and fishing but now i spend all my time seated down.
 

 Recently I began getting really nasty anxiety health it started when covid was really bad in 2020 and then we had a break from it last year and my health anxiety was almost zero but since mid october it came back and now every time I feel something in my body I magnify it to the maximum and think the worst. The other day I was listing all the diseases I thought I had in the last fcouple of weeks and the list was almost 28 different diseases... Obviously googling and searching youtube videos about it has become almost a routine in the last few weeks.
 

 And now here I am writing this with a dull pain in my arms and legs that started last Thursday in my ankle and I couldn't stop thinking about it and now it's like it had spread in my body like I have random pains all over. I just convinced myself that im going weak and im losing muscle because im doint nothing all day, but part of me knows its me but the other anxious part is telling me constantly that I could be something else worst."
"26M I've had low self confidence and anxiety for years, and I find it difficult to talk to attractive women my age. and I'm now starting to realize part of the reason is that in both high school and college I was made fun of or seen as a creep (back then I didn't have good social etiquette and stared at people way too much) by attractive girls in my classes. I've been able to improve my social skills and appearance slightly in the last two years (of course, there's always room for improvement) but I'm not sure how long it would take or what I would have to do for me to overcome my anxiety and low confidence; I think my mind has been somewhat traumatized by these experiences so I now default to thinking that's how all the attractive women will behave towards me."
"I'm 27 and I feel like I wasted my life. I didn't do a lot of new things because I was governed by anxiety. I wish I can go back in time with the knowledge I know now. I wasn't officially diagnosed with anxiety until 2020, so I never connected the dots. Hindsight is 20/20...
 

 Anyone else feel this way? How do you deal with it?"
"This is first time happening to me in such terrible way. 
 

 Yesterday I found out from my mom that my dad is very deep in dept. This has been ongoing for years now and I jut found out how serious this is. They are about to lose the house they are living in. The house my great-great-grandfather built with his own hands. House which me and my sister grew up in.
 

 My sister is living abroad with her husband and 2 kids so all the problems at home fall on me. My father is an alcoholic and has been for decades with very poor financial decisions.
 

 He is owing close to 20000€. This might not be large sum but my mom is working a low paying job and my father's addiction makes it almost impossible for them to pay this dept.
 

 We were living in pretty much poverty when I was young but my mom always kept us afloat. 
 

 I am 28 years old. While I am not making huge amount of money - I am doing good for the first time in my life and am actually thinking about buying apartment in future. 
 

 I could take big loan to pay off that dept but that would be huge hit for me. This would kill all my hopes and dreams of better future for myself. It would take minimum 5 - 7 years to pay off that size of dept.
 

 For all I care my father could be homeless but mom has done so much for me and given up so much. So I feel like it is my responsibility to help.
 

 While me I am in pretty good terms with my sister I can't ask for help from her as she has 2 kids and dealing problems at home has fallen on me.
 

 It's just killing me from inside. I just don't know what to do. There is no1 I could turn to and I feel so hopeless.
 

 Tomorrow is my birthday and this is the worst I have ever felt.
 

 I'm a guy btw."

"Pretty much what it says in the title!
 

 I started to feel like I was coming down with the flu while I wasn’t at home and I didn’t get a panic attack! I handled it calmly, with acceptance and didn’t rush home in a panicked frenzy. I stayed until it made sense to go and then I calmy went home.
 I just got home and I still feel like shit physically, but mentally I’m so freaking proud of myself - I feel like jumping up and down from pure happiness!!
 Not feeling well and having physical symptoms, especially when I’m not at home, are huuuge triggers for me, but I have fought hard for recovery lately and it is paying off - one small step at a time!!!"
"I am having problems with being aware of my heartbeat, or I guess heart papilations. It’s really annoying. I mostly feel them after activity or when anxious, but sometimes, other times too, but it just feels really strong, not fast. I went to the doctor and she says it’s fine, but a little fast. Seems unconcerned, but sent me for an ECG just in case.
 

 Anyone find anything to help? Breathing exercises just make me hyper-aware of my breathing and causes me false dyspnea."

"Honestly, I just want to write this down somewhere where someone will see it. I'm a lifelong sufferer of some kind of anxiety disorder. Most certainly GAD, but I suspect I may have OCD as well. I've never been evaluated. I've had many, many doctors try to put me on SSRIs and I've tried getting into therapy twice. Failed on all fronts.
 

 Now I'm 28 and I have someone in my life who is very important to me, my partner. I've always sort of just lived in my own chaos and it's normal to me. But my anxious behaviors and habits and dysfunctional ways are hurting my partner. I've totally lost control of my disorder ever since my partner fell sick with a chronic illness. Now I'm falling back into so many unhealthy coping mechanisms. Codependence being one of the biggest problem here. I'm obsessed with his illness. I never stop thinking about it. It's my first thought upon waking up and my last thought before falling asleep. It's eating me away from the inside and turning me into a shell. I can't live like this. I can't support my partner like this.
 

 I've been feeling so terrible lately. Like unbelievably unwell. It's hurting me, my graduate program, and my relationship. So I'm finally taking the steps to hopefully start getting better. I'm still not comfortable with an SSRI, but I compromised with buspirone. Just took my first dose last night. And I found a psychologist who I think will be a perfect fit for me. He can finally evaluate me, figure out what kind of disorder I have, and help me learn how to cope with it. And how to not explode my relationship by being a crazy person.
 

 So that's all. This is a big step for me. I've always been resistant to the idea of medication. Still am, I won't take an SSRI. But maybe buspirone will be what I need to get through this and start getting better. Therapy is hard for me. It causes a lot of anxiety itself. But I need to do this. It's time for me to really work on getting this under control. In a way, it's kind of scary to think of my anxiety being gone or at least much better. It's sort of part of my identity at this point. Part of me.
 

 I hope everyone here can find the support they need, whatever that may be. Anxiety disorders are incredibly painful."
For some reason I’m the bad person in this situation and all I’ve ever done was give this person the benefit of the doubt. But you can’t make an person value you or even see your worth and that’s what I’m learning… like I wasn’t toxic or anything..I was just myself but I had my guard up just for this person to just hurt me over something meaningless.. but all I can do for here on out is not look back at it. Just basically move forward despite how I feel about the situation…
"My brother always tells me that I have and NEED to make friends because ""you can't live without friends to support you, etc"". I totally disagree with him, I've always been a loner and have had 0 friend since I was 18.
 

 I'm perfectly fine with only interacting with my parents and sometimes my brother.
 

 As he used to tell me this a lot, I was starting to believe that something was wrong with me, so I'm recently trying to befriend some people. But the thing is, I feel sick every time I have to talk about me or my life/everyday life etc. I don't have low self esteem, I'm just super private &amp; introverted and don't want anyone else to get to know me and my business..
 

 Also, when people I've recently tried to befriend say ""I'll talk to you tomorrow"", I immediatly think: ""oh no, I'd rather spend my time alone doing my own stuff like reading a book/drawing or whatever...."". 
 Even though these people are very nice and kind.. I just want to be left alone.
 

 So, should I stop all this, say goodbye to those I'm trying to make friends with (&amp; be honest with them btw) and live as my heart says - or keep forcing myself trying to make friends, even though it makes me sick to my stomach knowing other people will enter my circle?
 

 Also, is anyone else like me or am I definitely abnormal?"
"i'm almost 18 years old (F), i don't know if this is important or not. i have had major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, eating disorders (bulimia), possibly ptsd because of SA, and also rapid mood swings (could be bpd, i still have to wait to turn 18 and go to an adult psychiatrist to get checked) for the past 6 years, i've been inpatient twice. 
 

 lately i've been experiencing such an intense fear of suddenly dying, what scares me is not the thought of dying itself, i don't care about what happens after death. for example when a car goes really fast next to me and it's loud, i get so scared that my heart starts beating really really fast, my whole body goes numb and i start to think about what if i already died but somehow time stopped. also when i go out to the balcony i always think it's about to fall apart and i'm going to die. i'm scared my food is poisoned, also scared of choking while eating/drinking, and of starting a fire in the kitchen when i cook something and burning the house down while i'm in it, being unable to run away. this isn't all, i just wanted to write down examples.
 it's really taking a toll on my physical health, i have constant headaches, stomach aches, after i experience these things i almost always throw up, it's making it impossible for me to eat which is triggering my ed, i'm currently in recovery, it was going well until these thoughts started about 3-4 months ago.
 i'm currently unable to go to a therapist, since i don't have enough money for it and i had to drop out of school a month ago because of my alcoholic mother, i moved in with my boyfriend (27M). i love living with him but i just wish i could live without this constant fear.
 

 has anyone experienced something like this, if yes, please tell me what helped you cope with this, i'm begging."
"Hi everyone :) I'm new to this thread and this is my first time posting. I was hoping that by posting here I could get some stuff of my chest and/or get some advice about something I've been struggling with lately. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder when I was 7 and borderline personality disorder when I was 23 (I'm 27 now). For the last few years I've really been able to manage my anxiety through therapy and medication but for the last 6 months or so it's been through the roof and I'm starting to feel like I can't cope. I feel like I'm going crazy.
 

 Anyway, lately I have been having a lot of anxiety about my parents. I am constantly worried about their health and whether or not they are happy. I know that these are normal things to worry about but it's taken over my life. I am constantly thinking about them and worrying about how they're feeling. The thought of them being sad or lonely for any reason keeps me up at night. I worry about them becoming depressed for some reason or falling ill. I'll get terrible intrusive thoughts about them getting sick, or something happening to them that would make them upset. I know it's normal to care about your parents but these worries feel like they're controlling my life.
 

 I've tried talking to my siblings and my partner but they don't seem to understand. My therapist listens to me but she has yet to provide any advice or insight as to why I am feeling this way, and will change the subject to something else. I know this sounds so crazy but I'm just feeling really alone in this. Has anyone else ever felt similarly, and what did you do about it?"
"Tw: mentions of depression and suicidal thoughts
 

 For some background, my job is pretty stressful - I(28f) work at a bakery decorating cakes. Every day I go in, even if it's a quiet/easy day, my heart is constantly racing. I dread going into work most days. 
 

 A lot of things have been going on in my life and I've been trying to manage but I guess yesterday it was too much. I broke down a bit before work but went in anyways. 
 

 At work, I couldn't talk to anyone and was in such emotional pain from anxiety and being depressed. I kept running to the bathroom to cry, and would come back out to work. (Idk if my coworkers noticed and were uncomfortable or didn't at all). 
 

 Kept having intrusive thoughts about ending it all. I became extremely uncomfortable with a pair of siscors I was using and had to step away. Started tearing up and then panicing that I was being ""weird"". Knew I couldn't do it and tried to go talk to my boss and broke down before I even said anything. She expressed concern, told me that there might be some therapy resources available and she'd look into it. I cleaned up and went home, but couldn't stop crying while cleaning up. Finally went home and my SO helped calm me down. 
 

 I'm not someone who cries in front of others and I'm embarrassed knowing I go into work today. Idk how to face my coworkers or if I should, incase it happens again. I've never self-harmed but yesterday was the most suicidal thoughts I've ever had, so I'm feeling very anxious. Feels like too much going on. 
 

 TLDR: Ugly cried yesterday from anxiety &amp; depression while at work and am now embarrassed going to work the next day."
"I don’t want anyone that’s temporary to be in my life or anyone that’s willing to hurt me without any reason, to even be around me. Like I want good people and good vibes I don’t wanna have to sit there and prove to anyone that I’m an good person but I have my limits. Like if you can’t see me and my value then there’s isn’t any point I’ll say what I have to say and then respectfully walk away. Because i know my worth and if your still focus on my past self you shouldn’t be apart of my present me. I gave out so many chances and I shouldn’t have to anymore."
"Hi, sorry if this doesn’t follow the specified format. I (27f) have been suffering from anxiety that’s gotten pretty severe in the last few months. It feels like there’s a heavy weight on my chest and i always have this knot in my tummy that makes me feel so sick all the time. im experiencing anxiety attacks almost daily. currently on medical leave from my job, which is a big stressor, so that’s helped a little. wondering if anyone has any tips they could share? thx in advance"
"25f I’ve dealt with health anxiety for years and I can’t fucking deal with it. 
 

 I remember the moment it triggered - sophomore year high school biology, watching a movie about cardiac events and the woman who’s perfectly healthy and normal son suddenly dropped dead said “and it could happen to you, too.” 
 

 It destroyed my brain and it never goes away. I keep myself awake until I physically can’t anymore because I’m so sure that if I fall asleep, I will die. I’ve had many doctors listen to my heart and lungs tell me everything sounds perfect. I’m too scared to go to a cardiologist because 1) I know it won’t really help and 2) I’m so scared of there ACTUALLY being something wrong that I can’t bring myself to do it. 
 

 Covid sure hasn’t helped. I work in surgery and see the absolute worst of the worst. I have long covid and struggle with breathing (I finally saw a pulm this month after 14 months). I had to be taken to the ED at 12am shortly after actually having covid because I was panicking so bad that I was CERTAIN I developed ARDS (surprise, I didn’t) about a month ago I heard an anesthesiologist ask a patient with cardiac history if “he can walk up a flight of stairs ok” and like I can’t always!!! So that triggered the heart anxiety so bad again after being okay for a while and now I spend every single waking second of my life focusing on my heartbeat and feeling every little variation in tempo and it’s making me ill. 
 

 I’m going to a new therapist on Friday who is part of a anxiety disorder specific practice which supposedly specializes in heath anxiety. This has to work. I NEED this to work. I can’t live my whole life like this. I’m tired and I’m scared and I can’t do it."
"25F, no health issues, I take buspar for anxiety 5mg 2x a day. I’m so tired. I can usually fall asleep just fine but wake up throughout the night and by 5-6 am I am awake for good, even on days I don’t have to be to work. I’m freaking out that I might have sleep apnea but I don’t wake up gasping for air and my boyfriend told me I never stop breathing or anything. Does anyone else struggle with this or have you? How do you cope? I can’t tell if I have racing thoughts or what it is."

So just got out of work and as I was collecting my things in my locker three of my coworkers were also there and they were already talking to each other. One of them acknowledge me the other two did not. As the coworker (the one that acknowledged me) was leaving both of my coworkers told her good bye. I was basically leaving right after and they didn’t say anything to me so I walked out with my head down not saying anything. Then I hear one of the coworkers go “Whatever” under her breath to the other coworker. Did I do something wrong I mean when I walked in the two didn’t seem to want to be bothered with me.
"I, 29m, use a lot of online dating apps, and I don't even bother looking at women's profiles if they're over 15 miles away. I have a fear of driving throughways so it turns what could have been a 15-20 minute drive into a 45-1 hour drive taking a non throughway route. I honestly don't even like driving. I've considered living car free but the only thing stopping me is that I know it would totally kill any hopes of finding someone and maintaining a relationship. I literally just go to work and go home, and what little shopping I do, is to stores I already know how to get to.
 

 I have a 1st date tomorrow with a beautiful woman, and the only thing stressing me out is how to get to the place. She lives 13 miles away and I picked a place 7 miles away for us to meet. 
 

 I'm on google maps figuring out an easy route and doing street view to see landmarks and what lanes I should be in. I could take an uber but I'm worried I'll look bad or he'll make me late, and hoping i could get one home. I'm worried my phone might die mid trip and my cigarette charger only works sporadically. Or google maps won't work.
 

 I'm worried if this date actually goes well how will I make it work long term. I feel like a loser. I'm 29 stressing this and she's only 23 and could probably do this in her sleep"
"I (28m) have had severe anxiety my entire life which lead to pretty bad depression for most of my 20s. I gained a lot of weight and became a home body. I've always just told myself that people don't like me so why should I bother. Over the past few months I have lost 60lbs and started to feel better about myself. Then I made the mistake of using dating apps which hasn't come up with much, now I can't sleep cause I can't stop thinking that I've wasted a good portion of my life and I'm going be alone without a family or kids. I don't have anyone to talk to that understands. My anxiety is debilitating to the point I freeze up when talking to new people or being in crowds and I always feel like people are staring at me in a negative way. I need help 😔"
"Hi, everyone. I'm 25 and I've been suspecting I have adhd for a while (makes a lot of sense) and lately I've been more keen to looking for a prescription if that's the case but I would like to know from people about their personal experiences.
 

 I'm aware that stimulants can increase anxiety in some cases and this, to be honest, is probably what keeps me from going further so I'd like to hear from anyone who struggles or has struggled with anxiety and took/takes adhd medication how was their overall experience, specially if you have/had panic attacks (fortunately I haven't in a long time).
  
 You could be elaborate or not, any input is appreciated but i'm looking for changes in stuff like:
 - productivity
 - mood
 - how long was the use of medication
 - sleep habit
 - side effects
 

 I don't mind big texts if you want to be thorough
 

 Again, any input is appreciated, thank you"
"Posting on a throwaway account to not feel anxiety about someone finding this post. 
 

 I am really struggling to be around my best friend lately. We have been best friends since we were 11, I'm 27 now, and in the past she has had some behaviors that were emotionally manipulative, maybe even abusive. Screaming at me in times of her emotional stress, projecting insecurities onto me and insulting me, taking jabs at my character, attacking me if I wasn’t available 24/7, ignoring me if something I did upset her but not communicating with me and holding me accountable for narratives she created. For example: I was studying for a huge test, in a language program where I wasn’t really allowed to speak English. She was having anxiety about something and I told her that I wouldn’t be available for a little because I was in a study session and asked if we could talk later. She then started to blow up my phone, saying I was a bad friend for not using my love of research to help her and that I was letting her down. I tapped out of study session to help her. After that, she ignored me for a few days. These types of comments and behaviors were common when she was upset. I would never know when it was coming. There were times where everything would be good and then she would go cold on me, apparently because of something I said months ago. Of course it wasn’t always bad, not even mostly. She just struggled to handle her difficult emotions. 
 

 For the past three years I have been in therapy and I have been very honest with her about all of these behaviors and I started to draw boundaries where I didn't before. In 2020, she did not respond well to these new boundaries but honestly after many talks, she was accountable and genuinely started to improve. She started to go to therapy to handle her emotions and I can see in real time (with her interactions with me and with others) that she is no longer this person.
 

 I haven't seen this behavior from her in a year, but I cannot help but still feel really anxious around her, and feel really anxious about everything that I say to her, I find myself overthinking every interaction and going through my words with a fine tooth comb. I also find myself thinking of defenses for possible jabs. If I don't hear from her in for a little, I’m immediately anxious I’m going to get attacked. My logic brain fully understands that this is just responses from my nervous system leftover from the way she used to treat me, but I cannot figure out how to stop having these reactions in my body. I know her feelings aren’t my responsibility, I know that I can’t be accountable for things she doesn’t share with me, but yet I’m still so anxious. Do you have any tips on how to regulate your nervous system when in faced with a trigger? Do you think I can even still be friends with her? I would feel terrible dumping her after she’s done all this work to grow."
"This is the last 20 years of my (M29) life with social anxiety. I’m sorry if this is not a list of tips or any motivational post, but getting this off my chest might be helpful in some way to me and maybe also you. For the sake of the reader, I have shortened many parts. Keep that in mind if something doesn’t make 100% sense.
 

 When I got to primary school, both my parents were very emotionally absent. My mum and dad were always at work. My dad was always very frustrated and my mum depressed. All I was to them was a lazy boy. I felt very worthless. As far as I know having a child and working long hours was too much for them, but there were definitely also other factors. My extroverted/loud personality back then might have contributed as well. There were also two very strikt teachers which really disliked me. I got made responsible for almost everything going wrong and had to repeat 4th grade, but I’ll spare you the details. While this has certainly contributed to some kind of complex trauma, it is too boring to expand on in this post. 
 

 When I was in 4th grade(I remember it only partially), I was walking back from school with 3 of my class mates. We were not friends and I didn’t know them really since I was so new to the class after repeating the year. I really wanted them to like me since I didn’t have any other friends. There was this girl walking in front of us. Apparently there was some quarrel going on between her and one of my class mates. They were exchanging words as she was walking away. One of the other class mates was also chiming in. At some point someone threw a twig at the girl. I can’t remember who or any other details. As far as I know the girl didn’t know who threw the twig. 
 

 The next memory I have was from 1 or more days later. My Teacher said that there was something that I had to discuss with the class teacher of another class. At some point during the class, a student from said class came to my class to get me and one of my class mates from the other day to talk to the other class teacher. When we got to the room with the other class teacher, we were greeted by an absurd scenario where a whole school class, the girl from the other day and their class teacher, were waiting for us. The teacher accused us of bullying the girl. She didn’t allow us to object to these accusations. It didn’t matter that I had only seen this girl once, or that I was just trying to fit into my environment. Thinking in retrospect, the girl was probably bullied before, but at the time I didn’t know any of that. 
 

 After that day, I got very anxious and insecure. For years I suppressed this memory. Maybe I felt guilty, maybe I was scared that my parents couldn’t be there for me if I told them. Maybe I was scared that they wouldn’t believe me and would take the side of the girl. I don’t know for sure. Before that I was already pretty shy, but after that, I was just gone. I was not able to look people in the eyes, have much small talk or express my emotions in any way much at all. I started to read books, play video games and daydream to an incredibly excessive extent. I spent almost not time in reality. I perfectionated my “everything is fine” excuses, even though absolutely nothing was fine. I slowly unlearned how to smile, to speak up or to meet new people. I watched my peers having friends and relationships. I dreamed about the life that I could live if I didn’t have Anxiety, but I didn’t understand what was wrong. I kept saying to myself, life couldn’t be this bad or that it all can’t be real. I wanted to turn back time or wake up from this nightmare. I wanted someone to help me, but no-one was able to understand what I was going through since I myself was not able to understand that i experienced constant anxiety. The anxiety was like a tinnitus, constant and everywhere. The only difference to tinnitus was that I could forget that I was feeling anxiety whereas it is much harder to forget tinnitus. My parents didn’t know what to do with me since I didn’t do any work for school at all. They blamed themselves and me for it all and were often angry and cold. At this point I was convinced that I am not worthy of any love, which made me withdraw even more. 
 

 Thankfully, I somehow survived the next 13 years. Life has gotten better since then. With 22 I had a girlfriend. To this day I have no clue what she saw in me, but I am grateful that she did. We stayed together for 4 months and I probably wouldn’t be here without her. A part of me felt worthy of love again. After our breakup I started to get really into self development. I started meditating, reading books, doing sports. etc. Later on I even started doing therapy which helped me immensely. I started doing retail jobs and having social hobbies, but It was never my absolute priority. Until the beginning of 2020. I decided that I wanted to finally master this aspect of my life and leave this all behind… And then corona came….
 

 I tried to do the best that I could with the whole situations. I worked out, tried to keep in touch with my friends and read as many books about self development as I could. I improved a lot, but I am still very lonely. I still have massive difficulties talking to girls or make new friends. At heart I am still a very extroverted person and the whole social thing is very important to me, but I don’t know if I ever will be good at it. I need hope, but it is hard to be hopeful when spending so much time alone for so long. I envy everyone without Social Anxiety. If only i could go back in time…"
"This deviates a bit from the core of what this subreddit is, but also contributes to my personal driving anxiety so I think it still fits.
 

 As a teenager living at home I had really awful anxiety and a single parent who was uncomfortable teaching me to drive - a combination of which meant that I didn't get my license, even after having gotten my L license/learners permit successfully 4 times. Now, I'm 27 and I have no one in my life who can help me by lending their time and their car, so I am relying fully on driving lessons from Young Drivers of Canada to teach me how to drive and get my N license (i.e., step after learners permit but before getting your full unrestricted license.)
 

 Not only is this frustrating because it's literally over $2500 to do these lessons (it's a bundle with in-class lessons, driving lessons, and access to their car for the test), but it's incredibly unreliable. This is the second week in a row where my instructor couldn't do my lesson because of car issues. At least last week she texted me before the appointment and told me, but today she made me do the 30 minute transit to our meeting point before telling me her windshield wipers weren't working. She was also late, btw, and didn't tell me until I sat in the drivers seat. It was snowing! She said we could go as long as the weather wasn't too bad, but the snow was picking up by the second - it was obvious we wouldn't be able to do it. We rescheduled for sometime in May, and I did the transit back home. Overall, this took around two hours out of my day - as I'm a student nearing graduation, this is time I can't really afford to lose like this.
 

 Why is learning to drive and getting a license so inaccessible? It's necessary to be able to do in Canada, the US, and so many other countries - why is it so expensive? 
 

 I'm just so frustrated and tired, and felt the need to rant."
"Hello reddit friends, 
 

 Just got over an anxiety attack here and just feel like I need some guidance from others to really find a way to go through this journey since I never really have people to relate to. 
 

 A little bit of background, I have been suffering from severe anxiety for the last two years (I am 25 years old). Commonly what I feel is that I am going to have a heart attack, with my heart racing (110-120 bpm), and this fear of dying from a heart attack. I think it stems from the fact that my family has a lot of heart problems. I have really bad muscle tension in my neck and upper back, as well as the left side of my chest, where I am constantly popping my shoulder and that muscle as a trigger from my anxiety. 
 

 Overall, I have gone through quite a lot of hardships and loss (this includes my mom and many other family members). I have a really heavy past as a kid/teen and it carries a lot of weight that brings me down at times. 
 

 In addition, there was one incident where four years ago, I partied a lot and one time I did experience chest pain and was in the hospital because my body was so dehydrated from alcohol, and it inflamed my organs including my heart. Even thought that year I was less anxious, I felt like I did some damage to myself.
 

 Fast forward to now, I am doing much better in many regards. I am the first in my family to complete college, have a good job, an amazing girlfriend, I live on my own (will be with my GF next month!), and overall I am living a much more calm life, without all the crazy parties and bad experiences I had in the past. I been making every move to take care of myself such as diet, working out, etc.
 

 YET, I am just so goddamn anxious. I think a majority if it does stem from work stress (first job out of college came with way more responsibilities). But I still have this underlying fear that my heart is going to give out. I have gone to doctors and they said I am fine and its just anxiety. Maybe so, but I am always in doubt because many of my family members have heart problems and have their first heart attacks in their 40's (I even had a cousin die of one in his 30s). I think I have just witness so much death that it has really heighten my anxiety along with the stress that I have been dealing with. 
 

 As far as taking care of myself, I have been trying to work out, do yoga, and practice meditation as a way to handle anxiety, especially because I feel it more physically than mentally. Yet, I feel like those natural ways haven't shown the best results. I have just started therapy 3 weeks ago so I hope that helps. Also I am coming to terms that I probably have to lay off the weed. I love smoking but it has been hitting me different in the last year. Ether way, I am trying to make changes that will help me in the most natural way. 
 

 A family doctor prescribed me Lorazepam, but I have been against taking it because I seen how prescription drugs messed up my mom, which she eventually grew a dependence and died from them. I only take Lorazepam when I feel like I REALLY need it (once every 1-2 months), in an emergency (for example, I took it right now because my heart was just racing so much and I was losing my shit and need to do work). Yet, at the end of the day, I just want to avoid meds all together.
 

 I think what I need is just to be aware that things are better than they were in the past, and that I am a healthy person. I am making steps to handle my anxiety in a natural way and just have to keep up with the routine. 
 

 If anyone has tips or advice on how they address their anxiety naturally, especially the type of the anxiety that is physical, that would be great! 
 

 Thank you all for your support."
"Ok so I (27F) am celebrating for the first time my boyfriends birthday and Valentine’s Day together, he’s the first relationship I’ve ever had so I hope he likes them
 

 I’m an artist, he knows this, and I tend to make gifts for people.
 

 So for his b day I went simple and got a wooden initial of his first name and painted it for him
 

 Valentine one… I’m admittedly a little worried. It’s really cute. A large wooden heart, painted and had the saying “Be Mine?” Carved into it by hand, then added a few pretty rose 3D stickers for the finishing touch…
 

 Also… I out loud without thinking said that “I love that about him” … I think I’m in love with him… I never thought romantically it could happen but it did
 

 Why am I so anxious about if he likes it or not, I know deep down he probably will but still…
 

 

 

 Update: I ended up not giving him the k but instead baked some cookies, he opened the gift for valentines and good news he seemed to love it so yeah I’m very happy about that"
"I'm 28 and have had social anxiety for a very long time. I just started a tech support job that involves speaking on the phone all day. It pays well and I have a good team, but it's really taking a toll on my mental health. I think my physical health is also suffering from the stress of the anxiety.
 

 Do y'all have any recommendations for jobs that involve minimal talking with other people? Preferably not lots of hard physical labor, I have some health problems that prevent that. But I could definitely sit at a desk all day and do the same menial task over and over again, happily. I have an associates degree in general science and some basic I.T experience.
 

 I've considered data entry, but it seems difficult to find legitimate remote data entry jobs. 
 

 In the next couple months I'll have health insurance (I'm American) and plan to seek therapy &amp; help for my anxiety. For now I'm just doing the best I can on my own. I just want to have the energy to spend time with my loved ones while I'm off work, but for now I'm so drained when I get off work."
"Hello everyone, I’m 28F and have been suffering with GAD for a really long time. Recently, my health anxiety has gotten really bad and has taken a toll on me.
 

 I used to love working out and live a pretty healthy life. However, I haven’t worked out since September and have gained a few pounds (10-12) through the pandemic. I have been wanting to go back to the gym but every-time I am ready to work out, my body shuts up on me the night before. I start getting really bad panic attacks and my body becomes really tingly and weird. I always feel like if I’ll work out, my heart rate will go up and every-time my heart rate goes up, I start feeling really anxious. 
 

 Since I’m not working out, I feel even worse and weak since I really did like working out.
 

 Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with this?"

"This I'm sure isn't going to be a revelation to most of you. 
 

 I'm sitting in the dark doing some thinking (I've been trying to think more since I've been improving from my chronic anxiety I've had since September) and I started down the same path of pity I like to trod down. The ""why me"" and ""I wish this was easier"" and I was thinking on some other junk I read on To Afraid To Ask about thinking how a severe accident or unfortunate circumstances that would theoretically happen to you might win you favor or pay back people who have wronged you. That and some other what nots and a nice thought popped in my head. 
 

 I've literally never had a unique experience or thought.
 

 This applies to both my life and my anxiety. Someone else is suffering exactly like me and I should be fortunate enough to know why I am going through this. Not only that but that makes me normal when I've never felt more abnormal. It also makes me feel comforted even knowing I'm destined to struggle more at least for a while. 
 

 Knowing I'm not special and coming to terms with the fact that my struggles are not unique is both sad and happy."
"Hey everyone
 

 Currently i'm struggling a lot.I am unable to do mistakes because i have such a fear of getting negative reactions. So i either avoid any situation where i COULD make a mistake or when a situation happens i'm like ""I will never do x again then because i can't see myself improve on tasks"".
 I feel like a idiot. I'm always thinking about the past, these memories always come back. I can't accept that i can't be 100% perfect and never forgive myself for doing things not the way i intend to. Everytime i fuck up i feel the need to be punished, sometimes physically (i got hit as a child by my father).
 I'm looking back so much that i'm not living in the present and i can't see any future for myself. I do have some dreams but they feel like as if kids talk about what they want to be when they grow up. 
 But i'm 26..
 

 

 I just don't know how to be proud and have any self worth."
"Why do ppl Judge ppl who are socially a little off??
 

 Are ppl not Educated on those that struggle with Anxiety??
 

  I'm well dressed with good hygiene and have a friendly face... Ppl approach me like if I'm a social butterfly but when they realize that I get nervous they start to JUDGE me like "" ohhhh she's a wierdo "" This is why ppl KILL themselves... If I didn't have such a Loving family &amp; faith in God idk what I would do.. I'm 26 and I stopped making friends at like 10. I've been going to therapy since 14 for depression &amp; anxiety... But being young and stupid I wasn't consistent with getting professional help... Since I turned 25 and realized dam TIME IS PASSING ME BY. For almost 2 years now I've been consistent with going to counseling weekly and taking my Meds everyday at the same time... Other than that what do you recommend I should do to try to break free of this trap called social ANXIETY that prevents me from meeting other people???"
"Been dealing with social anxiety my entire life. As all of you know, it can have a huge effect on our happiness when it gets in the way of fostering meaningful relationships. I've been in one ""serious"" relationship my entire life and I feel like it ended in such a way that was very traumatic (didn't get closure, was unsure of what was wrong with me that she didn't want to be with me anymore, etc. I put serious in quotes because it was during my teenage years and looking back on it with the perspective I have now, I understand that it was not a serious, healthy relationship, still it had an impact on me and it took me years to get over it). Then in college I had some really interesting experiences with some ""friends"" that took a lot of healing to get past and if I'm being honest I still haven't fully forgiven then for it. It caused me to descend even further into isolation and pessimism. I'm 27 now and it's only been in the last year or so that I've really taken positive steps on my journey of self-improvement and I just wanted to share my experience to let anyone feeling alone and/or hopeless that there are many people who feel the same way and can empathize with your experiences. People who are also longing to overcome their fears and won't judge you for any perceived shortcomings you feel you have. I recently started reaching out to old friends that I had neglected and it's been amazing to find someone who is comfortable showing vulnerability as it has helped me to open up and share more of myself, which showed me that not everyone is as judgemental or mean-spirited as my social anxiety wants me to believe. Over the last couple of days I've felt genuine human connection and I just had to share this small win on my own personal journey. Hope you all find the courage to face your fears and live your best life."
"Hey y’all. My fiancé (25M) has been struggling a lot with anxiety related to his new job and I want to make him a care package full of things that could help during the week since I live 1.5 hours away and can’t see him every day. 
 

 He’s having trouble sleeping, cries almost every day, racing heart, shortness of breath, very irritable, and is just being generally negative all the time which is not like him.

"Hi Everyone!
 

 I have had anxiety for a very long time.
 I have gone to therapy every week since i was about 17 and i am 29 now. Ive tried CBT, ACT and Edmr therapy and with different therapists too. My anxiety copes very well when i am in a routine going to work everyday at home, but my dream has always been to travel the world. That's what i want to do, and my anxiety holds me back from this because i get extreme high anxiety when i travel to the stage where it is greatly unenjoyable for me because i suffer so much. I have been doing exposure therapy with travelling for years and things have gotten a bit better but i overall still greatly suffer with anxiety when i travel.
 I am on CBD oil for anxiety but it dosent seem to be working well enough when i travel- it is a CBD with terpines mix 100mg/25mil from the Green Dispensary. I also take Valiums but they make me feel zonked out and then once they wear off i am back to being incredibly anxious again, the only thing I've found really great is alcohol. Alcohol makes me feel relaxed and happy but not zonked out or sedated like Valium makes me feel, i can actually enjoy myself when i travel and do the things i want to do, but i cant just drink all day long day and night, my body couldnt even keep up with it if i wanted to. I need to find a better soloution. Asking if anyone on here can provide some help because i am just so tired of living my life in a bubble where i cant travel just to feel like a normal person.
 Ive tried Lovan and Lexapro before and my anxiety was so bad on them like way worse so i switched to CBD and been on it since."
"I few months back I had a bad panic attack that I think started from not eating enough. After that I started eating allot and had bad anxiety when I hadn't eaten. I have been really skinny for the longest, but now I'm gaining weight and have a pot belly. I don't really feel hunger or thirst so its hard to know when I should eat. I'm thinking about getting a blood sugar testing kit to tell when its low and I'm not just freaking out.
 

 Has anybody else had to deal with this? Is there anyway to tell when its anxiety or actual lack of food?"

"Hey all,
 

 New to this subreddit. 25F in London, been living alone in a cosy studio flat for about a month now. I didn't plan on living alone tbf, I was looking for a decent flat near work with decent housemates but had to move in a period where everyone else was looking too ( post-covid ish vibe, people looking to return to the city) and it was nightmare to find somewhere nice so the trade-off was to live alone in the end. (Even with the current flat I was super lucky to be the first to view it)
 

 But I struggle to be by myself so I make loads of effort to be around people - Mon-Thu I go to the office and do gym or go for drinks after work, Friday- Sun I aim to see at least 2 people. But what happens this weekend. Friday went on a night out, Saturday went for brunch with a friend and then went home with no plans for the eve so I told myself, let me watch a nice film on the sofa and make a night out of it. Well, I started doing that and somehow I felt super lonely, stopped the film and started talking on the phone with a few people instead. And this honestly makes me angry at myself. 
 

 It's not like I was alone all week, I've been around plenty of people and yet I get one evening alone and it almost gives me anxiety. I know people say "" find a hobby"" but I feel that activities won't be able to distract me from the idea that I'm by myself. I just don't understand why can't I enjoy my company for 1 evening without crippling thoughts of "" there is no one in the flat, it's just you"".
 

 Idk if this is relevant at all but I also think I pretty much have anxious attachment style/ fear of abandonment with people too
 

 Sorry for the long post, I feel it could have been shorter but wanted to give a bit more context."

"I (29F) just bought a house by myself and am moving out of my parents home but ever since I bought it I’ve been so upset. 
 

 I know it will be good for me in the long run and that I need to start gaining independence, etc. but I love my parents so much and am devastated to leave. I can’t stop crying or feeling anxious about it because I’m going to miss my childhood house and living with them. It’s harder because I’m an only child and they’re sad I’m moving out but excited for me. I don’t want to let them know I feel this way, take the excitement away from them and make them feel worse about the situation. 
 

 Has anyone else felt this way or have any advice? I’m writing here because it’s excruciating going through all this alone I guess so even just purging my thoughts is a little cathartic"
"Hi,
 I was wondering if anyone has felt this before and how you do you cope or get around this?
 

 I so deeply want one more kid. I have one now that is almost 5. When I had him I was naive and didn't even think about this to the extent that I do now. I also have worst anxiety and panic attacks since then. So very different situation.
 

 I am so so scared of dying during childbirth and I read some reasons that could cause it and how it's rare but what if I'm that 1 rare person. There's no saying I'm not. 
 

 We only get 1 life and I don't want my fear to stop me from expanding my family and giving my son a sibling. This is what my heart desires no doubts about that. If I don't try for one more I will have guilt and regret.
 

 How do I get through this? I'm not sure if there is anything... I guess I was just wondering if anyone has dealt with this? 
 

 Thanks so much!"

 I’m very happy, the meds changed my life and helped me a lot, but I’m a little scared of leaving them. 
 

 I’m already down to a quarter my highest prescription and totally ok but I’ve sometimes wonder how is everything gonna be after not taking them. 
 

 My psychiatrist assured me I’m not gonna be out of them unless I want to and he’s not gonna force me, I had to feel ready and I felt I could manage. 
 

 I was wondering if you have any advice for that, and if you so kindly tell me some stories."
"Hey everyone! 
 

 I know I posted yesterday but today I had another successful story I am eager to share!
 

 This morning, my boyfriend and I rented a car to drive to the outlets today. I told him I wanted to drive since I was comfortable driving after major surgery I had 6 weeks ago. Im not gonna lie, I wasn’t nervous in the morning since I was unfamiliarized but drove like a pro! I was proud of myself since I wasn’t nervous and my anxiety wasn’t there since it was the first time in 6 weeks that I have driven and it felt liberating.
 

 A few hours ago, I drove my boyfriend’s car in the evening with moderate traffic by myself. Not gonna lie, my anxiety was at an all time high. Honestly, I handled it like a pro minus the nervous swerving my boyfriend noticed while I was driving his car 😩. He also followed me which make me feel good since he was amazed on my driving ability. Thankfully I got to our destination safely to drop off the rental. 
 

 I could say, today was a successful day in my driving journey! I’m very proud of myself since I didn’t chew gum but I will have some on deck to lessen my anxiety! I just wanted to share this huge leap!!"

 I have been diagnosed with GAD since I was like 14, I’m currently 26. 
 

 My GAD has caused me a range of issues that go from mild anxiety to full on panic attacks that last for weeks and months. 
 

 I had a couple of rough months last year. I’m doing much better now!
 

 But lately, I’ve been having this anxious thought and irrational fear that I will have an allergic reaction and that it could lead to anaphylaxis. I’m afraid this could happen and because of my fear.
 

 I’ve stopped trying new things, eating out, exploring new foods and/revisiting old foods.
 

 I’m really sick of this. I’m not only afraid of food… I’m afraid pollen might cause it, plants, exercise, sex, medicine, skin oils, etc..
 

 I’m really tired of living like this. I am allergic to shrimp but that’s it. 
 

 I don’t want to keep leaving in constant fear.
 

 Any advise ?? Any good way to get rid of the fear ?? 
 

 I’m getting to a point where I don’t want to go out much.

"I don't know if this is the appropriate place to share this story so mods, please feel free to delete if it's not suitable for this sub.
 

 Last night, I dreamt I was having really bad chest pains that steadily got worse as the dream went on.  
 At the end of the dream, I ended up calling an ambulance.
 

 I woke up with my heart hammering and absolutely overcome with worry. There was no pain in my chest whatsoever but I still felt frightened:
 

 Any time I usually dream about physical pain, it's often reflecting physical pain in the real world (for example, the time I sprained my ankle I kept dreaming of my foot hurting - especially when it was at weird angles during sleep).
 

 My partner thinks it was just an anxiety dream - surely any *really* bad chest pains would have woken me up? But now I'm freaking out that I had a heart attack in my sleep and I can't stop thinking about it.
 

 I'm 28 years old, active and female; a little overweight but not badly. I'm at no major risk of a heart attack in other words, but my 44-year-old brother had to go to hospital with heart attack symptoms a while ago and now it's a big fear of mine."
"Hey.
 A lot of people on Reddit find a lot of enjoyment in the adult content on the site.
 This adult content has given people a space to feel good about themselves, make women feel empowered and to discuss subject matter that is too risque to being up in real life.
 Yesterday, I heard that Reddit are planning on going public sometime this year and this content might be done away with.
 This is something that makes me feel anxious because I have made a lot of friends on those subs and I even made some posts myself.
 Is anybody else worried about the future of adult content on Reddit?"
"Hi. I(27f) working in the it industry. The anxiety got worse again. My anxiety is about personal relationships and work anxiety. My original job didn't fit me, so I quit and studied another job. As this job was related to what I had done before, I felt more confident that it suited me better. And since this month, I got a job, and in fact, my family is the only one in the office except for the occasional other employees. Another employee came today, and I said goodbye to the employee when he left work, but he was ignored. I remembered that no one accepted me when I said hello at my previous job. I told my mom and she said that when the staff said hello, she said hello to everyone in the office. However, I felt that I was ignored by the staff this time because I greeted the other person again when they greeted me. Since then, somatic symptoms have occurred, and now I feel nauseous and stuffy in my chest. Also, for a week, the bowels are not in good condition. I am worried that the staff may have bad thoughts about me. I plan to study at the company now to gain experience and work for another company later. Stress and anxiety disorders occur here too, and I am very anxious and worried about whether I will do well in other places. In fact, before I joined the hospital, I told the doctor that I had a job and increased the dosage of the drug, but if this is the case now, I think I need to increase it a little more. I was so stressed at my previous job that I had hives all over my body, and had trouble sleeping and panic attacks. Because of that, I couldn't watch dramas or movies related to the company or read articles. Every time I see a post about bullying at work, I get so scared. Is there anyone like me? And I only ate one meal today, but now I'm stressed and hungry, but I can't eat. I tend to lose my appetite when I'm stressed. I want to have a good social life. But I keep avoiding it because I am afraid. At my last job, I did a lot of that kind of thing in my relationships, and my parents were very scolded. Tears are pouring out of my eyes as I write this now. I know that there are many people who have a harder time than me, and I know that my situation is very weak. I want to be strong and I want to have good relationships. I want to change. How has someone who experienced the same symptoms or situation as me have changed and overcome? Today is the first time I have another employee, so it's very difficult. And because the company is male, it's harder to get along with people. the man is uncomfortable Most of the time, except when learning hobbies, I stayed at home. And when I was learning the hobby, the teachers were women except for about three, and the students were also women. I know that personal relationships between work life and hobbies are different, but if the teacher was a man, it was difficult to get close. At the current company, it's harder because everyone is my boss and there are only men."

"I’m so insecure about myself when my boyfriend of 6 years sister is around. I live with her and it stinks. I’m questioning though if it’s jealously or what. She is literally perfect in every way. She has it with looks, she always looks amazing, she has it with personality, she can strike up a conversation with anyone and can make friends with anyone. However, I feel so awkward around her. I’ve tried to get to know her, but it’s awkward and uncomfortable. I feel like I don’t match her perfect lifestyle, but I don’t know if that’s stemming from being insecure. Also we don’t click personality wise. It’s soo bad to the point of when I’m home and she’s home I avoid her like the plague. I’m fine around her when my boyfriends around, but that’s it. I’m trying to figure out if I’m insecure around or because I’m jealous of her or what it is? I’ve always been someone insecure about my looks so I just feel super uncomfortable being around girls who get all dolled up. Either way I just don’t want to feel this way around her I mean she is my boyfriends sister."
"Today, I drove to school for the first time ever. Not gonna lie, it was nerve racking since some lady in a red Volkswagen beeped her horn and drove recklessly on the way to school. Other than that, I felt so good since I never drove myself to school despite being 26 and being licensed for 3 months already. Not to mention, I drove in rush hour traffic in the city streets (I’m not ready for the freeway yet). I was anxious since there was a bit of traffic congestion and I’ve never driven on this specific route.
 

 After I got out of class, I was tired from my class and I had to drive us home. It was nighttime and the visibility was low. Not gonna lie, it was a bit scary since I’ve never driven in this certain area at nighttime. My boyfriend was amazed at my driving ability despite me being anxious of being in an accident once again. I just had to put in my mind, “you have to get home and to the destination safely”. I did that and I’m happy I got home safely!"
"I'm experiencing heavy backlash from my own mind. I've been trying to seriously battle my SA in the last couple of months, although mostly online. I've spend almost every single day talking to people on random voice call sites, and discord calls, some of them video. I've just made the decision of doing that despite the heavy anxiety I was feeling. 
 

 I sweated, I blushed, I forgot my words, sometimes I just mumbled a few words for the entirety of the conversation, but stayed nevertheless. And I'm better.
 

 But my old SA self feels threatened. It has come back with a vengeance. I've found doubting myself so much more, criticizing myself and replaying old embarrassing conversations and comparing myself to people. I'm at the same point I gave up a year ago. I thought I had this, I thought everything was going great, until the real test comes. Until real failure shows up. Until read doubt sets in.
 

 Am I going to really be serious? Am I actually going to go through? This was a nice run, but it's not meant to be, right? Those kind of thoughts are in my head right now. And I refuse to listen to them. I know better now. I know to love myself. I know to talk kindly to myself and that this too shall pass. I know there's a life beyond SA worth fighting for. I remember how much I've done in the past couple of months. And I'm proud of myself.
 

 And you should be too. Whatever you're doing, however small during your day to come out of your shell and battle SA, I salute you. You've got courage. ""Courage is not the absence of fear, courage is acting in spite of fear.""(Carly Fiorina) You might not see it as much, but it is.
 

 Opening up, being vulnerable, facing rejection, embarrassing yourself, doint anything that brings your SA out, that to me is heroic. You're a hero to me. For real. You might not realize this, but you're amazing. Keep going. You've got this. I believe in you."
"I have been friends with her since high school. We are both 26 now. We have known each other since third grade and had classes in middle school, but I never liked her back then. We got a lot closer the past 3 years talking about life and mostly about our crushes. She is very shy like me and really nice and sweet and gives me lots of good advice, but other than that, we have nothing in common.
 

 For the past two years she has become absolutely obsessed with a cashier at a gas station she goes to, and constantly sends me stories of their interactions. ***I'm talking about pages of screen shots from her notes app***. She goes like 3 times a day just to see him. She thinks they're soulmates but I personally don't see it. He also had a girlfriend this entire time. I made it clear to her before that I don't like reading these and she got offended. She did stop sending them, but only for a few days. When she doesn't talk about him, it seems we have nothing to talk about.
 

 Well last month it was revealed he only sees her as a *sister*. He also knew she liked him this whole time. I think he is an asshole for flirting with her and letting her think he liked her too, and I told her that. I gave her advice and said maybe she should back off (especially after the sister thing) but she insisted that this is ""all part of the process"" and she still sends me the stories as well as screenshots of their texts to each other. I stopped replying but now she thinks I am depressed and is asking ""how are you emotionally?"" but it feels fake. I know she is only asking because I won't respond to her stories.
 

 I don't know how to tell her I am sick and tired of hearing about this cashier and that I think she is pushing things too far with him. I also don't know how to say that I'm not depressed, just worn out from her. We only communicate through twitter dm's since she never wants to hang out with me, so it would be easy to disappear for a while from her. ***I just don't want to hurt her feelings since she has always been so nice and supportive of me before when I needed it.***"
"Hi everyone , i want to stay anonymous about my name i'm 25 years old and i'm here to share about my strory my insecurities my fears and my ANXIETY , i have no job and have never worked i still study , i live in my parents house , i'm single ( that's a quick presentation that has nothing to do with my anxiety except studies a little ).

"I've struggled with an anxiety &amp; panic disorder since I was 15 years old. I'm 25 now. I started taking Paroxetine when I was 16, and that went well for a couple of years. Until 2017, things went to hell. In 2018 I switched to Escitalopram and I did okay again for awhile. But last year, April 2021, things went very very wrong. Without any reason I woke up in an extreme panic attack that lasted for days. And everyday since that dreaded day I've felt incredibly anxious. All day long, 24/7 pure anxiety. Every. Single. Day. Leading to multiple crisis situations and suicidal ideation. So far I've tried Paroxetine, Escitalopram, Venlafaxine, Fluoxetine, Clomipramine, Mirtazapine, Olanzapine, Seroquel, Abilify, Propranolol, and probably some other medications I've forgotten. Some as stand alone medications, some in combination with eachother. None worked. The only thing that does work is a high dosage of Xanax but you can't take that for life. On the therapy side of things I've had Psychotherapy, CBT, EMDR, Talk therapy, and exposure therapy. Nothing worked. I can't live like this, I can't do anything. I can't even cook or change my bed because I'm so anxious. Is there anything else that might help? Anything that might be the answer I'm looking for?"
"I have 18 more classes until I can finish my final semester in my university. I am having the hardest time in my entire life. My tutors are expecting me to speak in class and they speak sarcastically when I don't, i am having very bad anxiety and I can't even look at tutors and classmates properly. Every class is like torture to me. I fear my classmates may report my avoidance of eye contact as bullying them. I think that my classmates not coming to class is because they think I'm bullying them. And I blame myself and I feel guilty and feel maybe I shouldn't come to class anymore. But I'm 25 and I really need a degree. I failed two times before in getting a degree and this time I made the wrong choice of course, but it's too late to change now. I don't want to fail this and I'm stuck in between. I feel I am in a losing position no matter I persist or give up. Uni counselling and other free CBT therapy have very long waiting list. What should I do?"

"Today my anxiety wasn't that big , except at 3 moment the first was when i saw a beautiful girl very cute i was at the library , and i feel very awkward next to her , i really wanted to talk ti her , but i didn't do it to not being strange , maybe if she comes another day i'll smile and say hi to her . Second , it was for my studies , lot of difficulties with that . Last it was with a neighbour , he's French , and i can talk french because it's my second language but with that neighbour , i just block and can't say a word , he's a native speaker and i feel anxious when he's trying to talk to me .

"How do you deal with feel of regret, or disappointment that you are wasting your life because you are to afraid even to go out? How do you deal with feeling that everyone around is living better life than yours?
 

  I've so many mixed feelings about this. This is not the best time for me rn, I see my friends posting on social media doing cool stuff, like dancing, traveling, parties, meeting with friends and I'm envious because I'd like to do that too, but somehow I can't. I feel like my life is slipping through my fingers, I'm 28 and I feel like I've never enjoyed my life. My closest friends are living in different parts of my country so we can't meet that often, they all have their own friends closer but I don't. I feel alone. 
 

 Today I saw stories on instagram of my far friend, a belly dancer doing another great performance and I started crying over myself and how useless I am. We started belly dancing almost at the same time, 4 years ago, she is doing it to this day but I'm not. Of course I've decided to quit at some point and I regret it. Again I feel like it could have been me but of course I had to ruin that too. I'm so dissappointed with myself, again, and again. I have lost all my hobbies and I hate myself for that. i feel like my life is nothing more than a waste"
"For the past few years since I started experiencing health anxiety, I have always been self diagnosing myself. A circle of going doctors, running tests, and fear of misdiagnosis.
 

 One thing I want to speak on (26F perspective), I never spoke to my bf about marriage or even talked about our future. Mainly because I am so scared that something will happen and I just won’t make it that far. That concludes me always living day by day and not being financially/mentally prepared as an “adult”. Having this mentality makes me break down so much. Every time I think about the future I just think why am I putting in so much effort if it might not even happen. 
 

 Anyone ever experienced this? How do you overcome this?"
And I am in my 20s😔😔
"We are at the point where we both know we like each other and want to be in a relationship when the circumstances allow it (he is 3,000 miles away atm). We ran into each other when he came back to town two weeks ago and in person it felt so natural and I felt comfortable talking to him and he even hugged me and said he was so happy to see me. But I still get so nervous initiating conversations with him even tho we text often. I don't know how to get over it, he is the only person I get this nervous over."
"I (26F) suffer from anxiety, but more specifically anxiety over developing schizophrenia. Basically I fear all the scary stuff people experience and what it would mean for my life if I developed it. I basically think I'm losing it or convince myself I have symptoms and obsess over it. I hate this. It doesnt help I have horrible migraines wuth aura that freak me out. Does anyone else experience this anxiety? Its eating me alive really but I'm getting help. I would love to know if anyone else suffers from this and how they have dealt with it."
This world/society often is a harsh place. It's not your fault if you're unable to cope with it. It's not your fault if you're more sensitive than others. Take time to rest and practice self care. You're not alone.
"I have had anxiety issue since I was a child, where it branched out with sexual harassment by a relative. I struggle with confidence and esteem but I am actively working on it. However I end up sobbing whenever I get emotional. Last night I had confessed this to him and a lot of other thoughts that go in my head related to this anxiety. I have never spoken about this to anyone but now I am ready to because I want to get over my past and move past it. However I am afraid that he will leave me after the stuff I told him last night. I am an emotional mess, why would he want to be with me? 
 

 I don’t want to lose him and meanwhile I am working on my issue."
"Hi… little bit venty… little panicky.
 

 I left my meds at my boyfriends by accident and it was too inconvenient to go back due to work. I haven’t had my meds in 2 days now.
 

 I will see him tonight so I can get them, but I feel so awful.
 

 I had awful nightmares again, I feel sick, I have a headache and I am twitching again - I have a nervous twitch which my meds help with.
 

 I am trying to tell myself I am fine but I am at work and my boss keeps asking whats wrong and I say I’m fine but I’m not because he thinks mental health is a hoax.
 

 I have no one to talk to and just needed to vent, thanks all."
"Hello every body , i feel really anxious today specialy because i've did nothing productive from the moment i wake up . I spent maybe 6 hours in social network watching funny videos ( that are not funny btw , it's just my way to skeeping responsabilities ) , anyway i try to not judge myself for what i've did and i still have some time to work till i sleep , stay strong guys"
"I find this concept of growth mindset vs fixed mindset , fixed mindset ( think that effort is useless , there are talented people and not talented people) growth mindset ( believe that you can progress by effort , and there isn't talented people and not talented , you can learn from every failiure you do ) i think anxiety is related to fixed mindset . What do you think ?"

"So this might sound strange but sometimes I purposely avoid things I really enjoy because the excitement eventually translates into anxiety. For instance, I really enjoy anime but I hardly ever watch it because depending on the show/movie I get too invested and excited and it eventually leads to me feeling really anxious(tight chest &amp; throat, feeling like my breathing isn't satisfactory). If I pace myself sometimes it works out okay but other times the feeling persists even after I've stopped watching. It's really frustrating, cause especially in this context I see people gushing about how good a certain show is or how cool certain characters are and I want to check it out myself but I feel like I can't. I spend so much time missing out and not to mention the spoilers I end up getting because I'm always behind. I get the same way when I try to play multiplayer online games or if I get really invested in a book. I've always kind of been this way honestly but since getting older my anxiety in general has gotten worse so I get overwhelmed more easily ; \_\_ ;"
"I feel like a very weak person mentally and emotionally. I’m so scared to continue being like this. I’m now 25F yet I still have these stupid feelings. I sometimes pretend to be okay. “Fake it ’til you make it”, they say. But deep inside I’m still scared to be left alone like I’ve always been. And this fear is affecting my relationship. I remember thinking like this since I was young. I grew up being so attached to my mom. She would take me to work, to the grocery, etc. even though I had other siblings who wanted to come with her too. I was with her all the time so it really affected me when she and my dad decided to let us stay at my grandma’s house when we were in kindergarten. I’d feel homesick everyday. Being at school was no fun because it only made me miss my mom. I was so attached to her that I couldn’t concentrate. My sister would watch TV and I'd sit by the window, missing my mom. We would go home only every weekend. This went on until I was in primary school.
 

 When I was in primary school, my mom wouldn’t pick us up until 6-8pm. I would watch other kids get picked up by their parents I would just cry and feel like she’d forgotten us. My sister would play alone and was unbothered. My mom would say whenever she arrived, “why did you think I’d forget you? I’m just late, it doesn’t mean I won’t arrive”. And she was right, why the fck did I always assume she wouldn’t pick us up. I think that was one of the first symptoms of my fear of abandonment. I’m the eldest and my siblings seemed to have turned out fine and become emotionally independent and stable. Why was my first assumption always that my mom forgot about me? It’s not a normal response and I feel so dumb yet I couldn’t stop thinking that way. I just got older but those thought patterns have never completely left me. Maybe I lack something in my brain. So many people have been through worse but they turned out fine. I hate to say this but I feel like an amnesia is the only thing that can heal me at this point.
 

 Fast forward to when I was in high school, I had my first bf. I never thought he would leave me at all because I was confident that he loved me no matter what. But my mom wouldn’t let me have a boyfriend so he broke up with me when I was in college after not having seen each other for a year. It was impossible to meet since my mom would drop me off and pick me up from school everyday. We were together for 3 years. It took me 3 months to get over that relationship. When he returned, I did not want him anymore. But it had changed the way I thought about relationships. I was always depressed even after I got over him. I thought I wouldn’t find love again. I would see other couples and even married relatives and think, could I ever find something like that? At this stage of my life, my parents separated due to my dad’s affairs and multiple baby mamas over the years. It made me feel so hopeless about love.
 

 A few years later, I had another bf. I was with him for 3 years but he cheated on me. The worst part wasn’t the cheating though. The entire relationship he kept dropping hints that he wished I was different. The cheating part was only the confirmation. Those years sucked because almost every week he would feel “confused” of his feelings for me. I was too cowardly to leave even though I was unhappy because I was afraid no one else was out there. He said body and face-wise I was attractive but mentally not since he couldn’t have deep conversations with me. I got over him in one and a half month. That experience made me conclude that maybe I’m not meant to find someone since I couldn’t please men mentally.
 

 I’m now in a new relationship. Been together one year. He’s been the best bf I could ever hope for and not once did he ever make me feel he is confused of his feelings for me. He says I’m the best person he has been with. However, I suffer from relationship anxiety whenever we have a minor misunderstanding. Like, he fell asleep for 10 hours straight when he was supposed to call me and I felt so anxious. It was so stupid. I told him that and he was understanding. But I can’t help but feel this is making me unattractive to him. Not to mention it is super unhealthy. I know I need to get better but I don’t know where to start. Therapy isn’t an option for me right now since I can't afford it yet.
 

 It is my dream to be married to my true love and to have a happy family with him in the future but I fear that my lack of confidence and hope is getting in the way of it.
 

 Sorry for the lack of coherence in this text, I’m a mess and English isn’t my first language. I just really wanted a place to dump these unhealthy thoughts.
 

 tl;dr I feel like a mentally and emotionally weak person because of my fear of abandonment. I don’t know if it’s from my childhood experience or relationship history. Or, it’s just innate. Regardless, I just wanna let this all out and hopefully get some advice. Thank you."
"I (28M) have not felt well in recent weeks and have monitored my blood pressure using the at home device. I will typically get readings of 150/88 etc. This concerned me and I brought it up to my doctor but he seems to think all my issues are anxiety related and prescribed me Zoloft. That same weekend I wound up in the ER for a stomach bug and my blood pressure readings were normal.  
 

 However, ever since I got back home and have been taking Zoloft I've noticed a lower heart rate and still get high blood pressure readings in the 150s-/80s. I'm so confused as to what is going on. The doctor said my blood pressure was somewhat high but didn't do anything about it. And the ER visit makes it seem like I'm just crying wolf."
"26F - Every problem I have right now has been because I created it due to avoiding everything. Anxiety and depression have gotten worse through the death of my mom, and almost dying myself from the same medical condition. Going to work started to get harder and harder. I quit. I'm now stuck just watching my debt pile while trying to get myself another job. Job interviews make me want to just crawl in a hole. I've been doing Uber when I can since there was no interview process I could kind of just start working. I'm scared of what my life is becoming, yet I still can't get up. It's all building up, and it's all my fault. I just want to give up. I guess I really already have. Need to try again. Ahhhhhh"
"I (M26) am currently seeing someone and am slowly developing more than sympathy for them. I kinda see us at the stage where it is more than reasonable to start talking about where we are heading and show my appreciation for the person, both physical and in words. 
 

 However, given my past I am quite hesitant to do so. Not because I am afraid of rejection, but because I am scared of ""being played"" again. I am a quite empathic person who is supportive and caring, which has been abused by some people in the past. Not wanting to victimise myself, I must admit that I have let them use myself. I have had my fair share of talks with a therapist about it and I am aware that the person I am seeing right now has nothing to do with my past encounters. Yet, I am scared. 
 

 What to do?"
"I have had a tough past, I don't want to get in the details of this but I am already on this beautiful journey of making things better and gaining my confidence. I have two friends but we do not meet often and I am overly dependent on them emotionally. I want to branch out and make new friends but I do not know how to go about? I have lost two close best friends last year when I decided to stood up for myself. So it is difficult for me to trust anyone and make new friends but I do want to do that. How do I do that?"
As far as this post I'm diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression although I think there is more to be diagnosed. I started to isolate in my late teens (now 26) and thought nothing of it because I was sort of allowed to isolate because my mother knew I had bad anxiety and social anxiety. Now I'm 26 and currently staying at my father's and see my half brother and sister 18 and 15 doing well and in school and having a social life. And I just am struggling really hard to find my center. It's almost like in my isolation I forgot a lot about life if that makes any sense. Does anyone have a similar experience where they feel they've missed out on so much that they feel it's hard to get on their feet again?

"Hi Reddit,
 

 I (27F) was dating a girl (25F). Everything was going great, we talked on the phone 3-4 times for more than 3 hours each time. We met for the first time, everything went well. We did our date, then end up talking for hours in the car. She made comment like I want to cuddle, ask me when was the last time I kissed someone, she even invited me to her house (which suprised me because she's not the type to invite people over on the first date... and I think it surprised her as well). I told her I couldnt because I was working the next day but that we could do this on the weekend. I ended up kissing her, even if I told her that I wouldn't. She told me that she was glad that I did it because she wanted to as well. The next day, everything seemed fine. We talked about our kiss, she said that she was it felt good and natural, she didn't feel like it was the first time that we were seeing each other, etc. On the saturday I was busy so I texted her less, not putting as many emojis as usual and it took time for me to answer. On sunday she told me that she couldnt make it tonight because she forgot that she had plans with her aunt. It made me mad because I hate people flacking on plans so I was answering her text but not as happy as usual. She then told me that she was worried about my tendancy to back off (because I told her I already did that in the past) and that it's tough to know if someone was still interested, etc. I told her that yes I was diappointed but I was still interested. Then during the week everything went south.... she took hours to reply to my text messaged, I invited her to do something and she had an appointment that was very emotional so I just asked her if she was okay and that I was there if she needed to talk, then left her space. I felt like she was distant so I just let her some space and she confirmed that she was. The next day she tells me that she only wants to be friends for now because kissing on the first date was too much and it was going too fast and that she was scared. She told me that she was still interested. I told her we were going to take it slow, that I had respect for her, in a neutral tone without using too many emojis (I felt like I was being rejected for the 4th time so I didn't feel like putting a lot). I told her it was getting complicated, and that it was emotionally draining this yoyo thing. anyway she asked me if we were still going to see each other this weekend and I answered a simple ''yesss''. After I made some research to try and understand what she was going through, I even told her that she could bring some friends along on the date if that would make her feel better. I told her to let me know if she was going to cancel because that's something that makes me mad when people are not reliable. she answered back but I was rock climbing that night and then just went to bed so I didn't answer right away.... the next morning she texted me that it was going in circle, and that we should cancel our date. That her questioning, my distance and that it wasn't normal that it was already so complicated to deal with her emotions. I told her that we should talk about it instead of texting and she told me that it was more simple for her if we didn't talk and that she could'nt call me..... 
 

 sorry for this long text! Anyway... what the fuck just happened in one week!? going from the first date where everything went well, that she even surprised me by asking to go to her house.... to being a rollercoaster of emotions... and so much pressure for nothing, when for me everything was so simple. What do you guys think? I was interested in her but god.... I don't know how it went so complicated. Should I let time pass and contact her again? She never told me that she wasn't interested anymore (and normally she's pretty honest about that).
 

 A little bit about the girl and our relationship: She has denied her attraction for woman and that's relatively new to her, she has dated one girl previously for less than one month. I have not that much experience in that department either. She has anxiety. She was pretty open when we talked and I was really transparent from the start, answering all her questions and being really open. I don't really know about her past but I think she was in an unhealthy relationship. she told me she wanted to take things slow from the beginning and I told her that I wanted the same thing, etc. We were on the same level about it."

"Hello everyone I'm posting here for a bit of advice or maybe to get this off my chest 
 

 

 I'm 28 now and have just started my first proper full time job I'd done some odd jobs in the past but nothing more than a few days here and there, I've been on disability benefits for probably 6-7 years due to my poor mental health and have had to come off them since starting this job so that's caused some serious anxiety as that safety net is no longer there if the job doesn't go well.  
 

 

 My mental health has improved a lot over the years if I said to myself a couple of years ago I'd be in a relationship and have a job and be learning to drive I would have said that would never happen, however I lost my grandad last year was practically a second dad to me and it's coming up on one year since he passed which probably isn't helping things much on top of my mental health not being a 100%  
 

 

 I'm only on my second week in the job but I'm finding it really hard to see myself here in a couple of months time not so much because the people aren't nice or the work is crazy hard it's also work from home so that helps with not having to interact with people in an office 8 hours a day, but I fear letting myself down by not being able to cope and being stuck living at home forever and my mental health never recovering to a point where I could work full time. 
 

 

 Does anyone have and advice on how to tell an employer about poor mental health? I feel like as I've not been in the job long it's a bit too early for me to be saying to them I can't cope and asking for them to change my hours and make other exceptions when potentially a month from now this job could feel a little more normal, I guess it's fear of the judgement they can't discriminate against me for my mental health but I'm worried they might find some way of getting rid of me. 
 

 

 I do have the support of family and they understand how I'm struggling but they believe I can do it even if I don't myself, I guess what I'm asking is does anyone have a story about a new job they started and how they coped and how things got better and how long it took for things to get better I know it will take people different amounts of time to get better but might help me a bit if people who struggle like myself have found the light at the end of the tunnel. 
 

 

  
 Sorry if it's a bit of a long read my head is all over the place currently and couldn't think of a better way to write it all out"
"I’m(27f) fat and have been varying levels of chubby (never skinny) through my life - but had always been really active and good at sports- in and out of school (I was a competitive swimmer and basketball player) (I just ate too many carbs as a kid without knowing any better - rice and pasta and all that) - as a grown up I’m so nervous to hit the gym cuz I know even though Im good at working out, people are going to judge me for being fat and assume I’m a lazy slob 🤷🏽‍♀️ This resulted in me avoiding going to gym and actually becoming the lazy slob I didn’t use to be. I’m going to start gym again in a week after I move. A gym which I used to go to 2 years ago where I know some trainers will remember me cuz my parents are a little well known and they knew them as well - I’d feel more comfortable if I was invisible but I loved this gym and it’s a really good one and walking distance from my new place. 
 

 It usually takes me like 3 months of consistency to become pretty fit again - I just hope I can get through that and all the stares of “oh look at the ugly fat girl trying to work out” - since it’s a posh gym, a lot of people dress well while I just wanna wear basketball shorts and T-shirt. 
 

 I also get a lot of unsolicited advice from people who think they know better just cuz I’m fat (people telling me I shouldn’t lift cuz I’m fat and a girl and should just stick to cardio etc - yes cardio is important but I ENJOY lifting so why can’t I do both if that’s what keeps me consistently coming to gym? I know myself better than you - LEAVE ME ALONE)
 

 I know I should just ignore all these things and just hit the gym without caring what other people think or say (and that is the plan). I just hope it won’t take too much of a toll on my mental health. I really want to get fit and lose weight cuz I do love to be active and working out feels great once I get through those initial unfit months and get my stamina back up."
"A few days at work I had to look after a group of little kids along with my boss (I work at a library that organised dance and art classes for kids). 
 

 I hate looking after kids i don't know/ who aren't related to me. They stress me out, I can't connect with them, and it being at work, it stressed me even more.
 

 I also wasn't feeling well that day, but I did my best to smile and interact with the kids, making sure they were safe, that they didn't feel ignored etc.
 

 Apparently some parents told my boss that I wasn't smiling enough. Today I heard that I should smileeven if I feel bad, because people are important to us, and the impression is very important. 
 

 Both my boss and coworker told me it wasn't admonishment or scolding, that they understand it's my first full time job and I don't know many things, and they want to help me avoid an angry parent in the future - but I still couldn't help it and started to cry. 
 

 I felt so embarrassed, I still do, and now I feel like everything else I do at work I also do wrong, and how on earth am I going to work there for the next year, and how I don't want to pretend. When I calmed down I apologised to them, and openly told them how i feel - and they said that I feel like I can't look after kids, I won't have to. That they understand me crying. That my work is good overall. 
 

 Why then do I feel like I'm a shit worker? That they're angry at me? I wanted to end my therapy already, but I feel like I'm far from being okay."
"Hi guys, I’m a 27F who has been living with anxiety for as long as I can remember. Like, I can literally remember panicking in first grade over the smallest things and having the school nurse try to calm me down. In my teens, it definitely got worse but I somehow managed and learned to live with it. I became a “high functioning” anxious individual. Over the fear of disappointment I became a straight A student and tried my best to excel in all aspects of life so I wouldn’t feel as anxious. I noticed the more I kept myself busy, the less anxious I am because I’m too preoccupied with other things. But make no mistake, once those pervasive thoughts get into my brain it’s a vicious feedback loop and becomes really hard to break. Anyways, fast forward to now, I’m in my final semester of medical school. Everything was honestly going great until something traumatic happened to me last year. I have literally been struggling to keep myself alive since then. Every day is a battle and I’m just so tired and sick of it. I have a very supportive boyfriend who tries to calm me down and tell me things are gonna be okay but my brain just won’t stop. I’m also afraid that my constant and excessive worrying is going to drive him away because I’m sure it’s exhausting to have to constantly console someone about their irrational fears and obsessive thoughts/ memories. I’m honestly at the most critical stage of my career and my mental health is just not cooperating. I’m not on medication because I feel like I’m genetically susceptible to addiction and mental health issues run in my family. My grades are going to shit because all I do is cry all day. I can’t get myself to do anything let alone study. Even if I somehow crack open a book my mind wanders and replays the events from last year. I don’t find pleasure in anything anymore and I find myself sleeping through most of the day (the only time I can get away from my thoughts). I’ve tried everything and anything to get myself back to “normal” but it won’t work. I even took a semester off and moved back to my parents house for a while for a change of environment but even that’s not helping. I feel so numb to everything, as if I’m not even alive anymore. When I look into the mirror I can’t even recognize myself. I also have suicidal ideation. I know I need therapy but I don’t have access to a therapist at the moment (and my parents don’t believe in therapy). I can usually bounce back from these “phases” but this time is different. I am really really struggling.
 Please if anyone knows of a way to stop feeling like this or has gone through something similar, I would appreciate any advice"
"I find that I am this way, where I run out of things to “stress” about so I start creating things to stress about. Or I have a very happy time and feel in a great place in my life, I’m bombarded with thoughts of “something bad is going to happen soon.”
 

 I don’t think I’m alone in this, and I don’t even necessarily know if it’s true, or if then “bad” things end up happening because of my mindset? 
 

 Then I realized, is the way I feel that way because of tv/movies? Think about every show or movie or book, most involve the good times before the bad times. The happy family is shown together having fun before everyone goes wrong, the couple gets married and has a great memory before something terrible. I would say it’s a consistent staple of stories where before the bad thing can happen, the stage must be set as a “happy” place so they viewer can feel more of an emotional response once that is taken away.
 

 Do you think those of with anxiety internalize that from media, and inject into our lives when it really might not be reality? Or is the true nature of life that good things are fleeting, and destined to be followed by bad things?
 

 Sorry if I’m not making sense or if this is not the right spot for this."
"So, I [25F] started a new job last week. I’ve been working at a pharmacy for the last couple years (initially full-time but went down to part-time a few months ago), but recently I’ve been frustrated with the stressful environment due to COVID only getting worse by the day, then my request for a raise was denied by corporate. I was hoping to find a new job to start at, work both for a bit until my manager at the pharmacy could hire some more people (since we’re already understaffed), then quit there and continue at the new job.
 

 My mother is a nurse and is friendly with a lot of local doctors since she sees them a few times a week when they come to the hospital to do surgeries. A few years ago she had gotten me a job with one of the doctors at their office, and when she heard that I wanted to try to get out of the pharmacy, she told me that another doctor in the same specialty as the first had a part-time opening at their office for a very similar position. Sounds great! So I got in contact with them and set up a time to “meet the practice and get a tour”.
 

 When I show up there, I end up in more of a formal interview situation than a casual first meeting. Sure, fine, I’ll turn on my “job applicant” persona and just have to deal with the inevitable anxiety from the unexpected situation. But then they mention that it would be 3 days a week and start at 7:30 in the morning, when I was under the impression (from my mother, to be fair) that it would be 1 or 2 days a week starting at 8:30, then they’re talking about when I can start. Everything’s just happening so fast. Now I’m even more anxious, but feel pressured to go along with it and try to just let it happen because sometimes you just have to deal with the unexpected and push through before you can feel comfortable again, right?
 

 I kept pushing myself through the first 2 days of training (mostly just shadowing, I’m nowhere near the point where I’m doing any work that’s beneficial to the workload) but the long days and early commute are just painful to me. I’ve been a little anxious while I’m there, but that’s just the expected new job anxiety and I know from experience it would go away in a month or so. But I just know that working 9 hour days and having to leave the house at or before sunrise will wear at my sanity severely. As much as I complain about my other job, it’s only a 5-minute drive from home and I never have to be there before 9; considering I naturally go to bed around midnight and have huge difficulty waking up before sunrise, it just works for me. It’s painful to have to force myself to sleep before 11 and set at least 5 alarms to make sure I wake up by 6, and I know myself, so I know if I keep trying to work these hours I’ll be living on too little sleep and be chronically late to work. Plus, starting there has kind of recontextualized how I feel about my original job; I might have my daily frustrations there, but at least it’s closer to home, better hours, and I feel comfortable and in-control from working there so long.
 

 Long story short: I think it would be best if I quit now instead of wasting the practice’s time and money training me for weeks while I keep forcing myself to try to adapt to something that isn’t a good fit for me. Problem is, just the thought of quitting is giving me immense anxiety. My mom will freak out and be disappointed in me for not “being reliable” or “following through”, I’ll feel bad for acting like I’m excited to be there and enjoying my training just to turn around and bail out of nowhere, and my mom and the doctor might feel awkward or embarrassed around each other because of me. Today was my only day off for the next 6 days and I’ve spent the whole day ruminating and stuck in this anxiety spiral instead of being able to relax and enjoy my time off.
 

 Do I risk personal well-being and job performance just to “stick with it” even if the main problem can’t be fixed, or risk personal humiliation and disappointment to feel more comfortable in my work situation?
 

 TL;DR I want to quit a job I just started due to unexpected changes in circumstance that don’t work for me, but don’t want to disappoint my mother or new boss just to accommodate myself"
"I have had my license for over 4 years, and have barely driven. (I live in a country were this doesnt cause much inconvenience). Now I have bought a campervan with my partner and plan to live in it one day. I really hope that I will be able to drive it soon, without anxiety. But I'm really anxious for the lessons. :/"
"I am 28 years old and just got my first job at pandera bread. My aunt works there and about 2 weeks ago told me they were hiring. I first said no but later thought about it and decided to do it 
 I went to the interview today and got the job. The supervisor didnt ask me many questions. My job will be dishwasher and or working in the front cleaning or refilling coffee.
 

 I am terrified. For about 6 or 7 years i have rarely left my house. I am a short fat guy. Alot of the staff are talkative and i will not fit in. I just would like to talk to someone
 

 Edit: my first day went well. In the beginning i watch some videos and then starting training for the job. Dishwashing is very easy and i am in the back of the store. Didnt have to talk much. Thank you for all of you help"
"Not sure if this has been shared already, but I thought it was incredible how this guy faced his fear of rejection by going through 100 days of crazy challenges he does in public that he talks about in his ted talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vZXgApsPCQ&amp;ab_channel=TED . 
 

 He recorded all 100 days on his youtube channel as well, some of which are really hilarious. I thought it was really inspiring how he had the courage to face his fears, and how much he was able to improve and learn about himself
 

 Here's his youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/c/JiaJiang"
I am 25 had 7 ct scans in 2020 and a nuclear stress test in 2021 now I'm terrified of cancer it was 113 mSv for the 2 years I had covid and was trying to get answers now I'm scared to death I'll have cancer
"Earlier today, I drove my boyfriend to the ER in the rain. When I drove us home, it was raining hard and I never driven in the rain. Not gonna lie, it was the most nerve racking drive I had. I didn’t have my gum or a cold drink and my anxiety was at it’s highest but I got us home safely and it was satisfying to accomplish my fear of driving in harsh weather conditions."
I'm 27 years old and I do have anxiety problems and I tend to pee a lot especially at night. How do you relax yourself in order not to pee?
"25M. I broke up with my 28F girlfriend a week ago after convincing myself she was the root of all my problems, our relationship was bad, etc. For a couple days she tried to talk to me, to get me back, but I literally lost all emotions for her. I thought I was happy, made the right choice, and everything felt perfect. As usual, OCD reared its ugly, destructive, pathological lying face....
 

 I talked about all our horrible relationship problems to my siblings (my closest friends) and now they don't approve even though I made half of them up in my stupid fucking head. During our breakup, she needed me and I wasn't there for her. I gaslit her into thinking she was the problem and it was really me.
 

 I've done so much progress up until this point and feel so defeated. I secured my diagnosis a year ago, working through therapy and my ocd/anxiety/rocd/depressive episodes, taking my medication, etc. Now my ex won't speak with me and I completely understand why. It's my fault. I woke up a week later wondering how the fuck I got here.
 

 I broke up with my ex several times before and she always took me back. She's the most understanding, kind, patient person. She suffers from her own mental health problems and traumas but she has always been there for me. I'm obsessed with perfection. I think that's mainly due to my extremely religious upbringing. I confessed every problem she had, every doubt I had, and I ruined her. It's my fault and I'm so ashamed.
 

 Now, during this breakup, I figured out her father has health problems that she didn't tell me about and now shit has hit the fan. He's really sick. This whole time she couldn't depend on me for her issues, and I took that and thought she was ""too much"" or ""too needy"" or we weren't compatible.
 

 I cannot focus on school right now. I have a thesis to write but it's all a blur. Some helpful words, advice, or thoughts would be most appreciated right now. OCD is the devil. It lies, tricks, gaslights, hurts, etc. And now I lost someone really special."
"I am 27 years old and at the age of 14 I had severe depressive and anxiety problems which then worsened in the first months of university. in these days I have realized that nothing has changed and that I am always stuck in the same place, while all the people I knew are having success in life. I think there isn't much to do now but accept a life of failure."

"Hi, I came here to vent. I’m so tired. I feel so defeated.
 

 I had a work happy hour tonight and I ordered a coke because I felt anxious on the drive over and was concerned about my neck pain. Everyone around me was like drinking would make something like that better (not in a pressury way or anything) and usually I’d agree. But not lately.
 

 I’ve had anxiety as long as I can remember, but the panic disorder and attacks it brings are new in nature. I remember the start of 2020 before Covid really was widespread, I just would get panic attacks in public. Convinced that I would just drop and have a seizure or make a scene or that something was going to happen to me because I just felt like it was supposed to. 
 

 I went to several appts with the eye doctor for blepharitis and pingueculas on my eyes, he did thorough inspections and I flat out asked him, would you know if I had a brain tumor? He said in a very litigious way, yes there are ways he could tell and that based on where he’s sitting, I’m ok.
 

 I felt a bit better after that and then Covid came and honestly, I faired pretty well. Staying inside and being a homebody, my biggest stress was worrying about what my parents were doing and hoping they wouldn’t catch it. I fainted once thinking the one time I went over to their house I gave it to them, I didn’t. But I was all worked up.
 

 Anyway, let’s hop to now. I fainted in November in the middle of the night, I woke up with shoulder pain and sat up, my fiancé rubbed my shoulder and next thing I was out and came to 30 seconds later. I’ve never understood that. It scares me.
 

 I ended up going to urgent care because the shoulder pain became tingling, that led to an ekg which came back abnormal as well as a muscle spasm to which they gave me muscle relaxers.
 

 Before I tackled the spasm, I went to the cardiologist first because that was freaking me out the most and I knew I’d have to be so brave, the first appointment and all that followed were so stressful, I had so much muscle tension, daily tension headaches, disassociation. I was not in a good place. Eventually I got the ok, I have a PFO but apparently it’s benign and I shouldn’t worry.
 

 So next up was the ortho, again stress, had to get X-rays. He thinks it’s a pinched nerve. Ok. Next up is PT.
 

 Physical therapy feels serene while you’re there even when it hurts because I feel like they know what’s going on. My shoulders feel so free and less tense but due to the pressure being placed on my muscles, I have soreness in my neck and areas I’m not used to being sore in. This feeds my anxiety.
 

 I’m anxious about my visual snow and my neck never going back to normal.
 

 

 But more than anything else, I’m just so tired. I feel like to outsiders, I look like such a baby. But I know how brave I’ve had to be. 
 

 I just wish I knew how to stop this feedback loop and go back to normal. But I think I’m falsely remembering a time I was normal. Maybe this is just how living is for me. I’ll always remember memories better than they actually were because I was suffering internally during them. I feel like I’m living a half life and who I really am wants to live fully.
 

 I’m just so tired."
"Hi all, I (M26) know I have gotten my license but I want to help others out that need help or advice on how to prepare for your written/permit exam. 
 

 Use https://www.dmv-written-test.com/
 This website helped me out significantly each time I had to get a permit ( I got total of 5 🤷🏽‍♂️ ). The practice exam question(s) are exactly the same as the actual exam questions (on the actual exam they can be shorten or alike). I memorized the key words (ex. California = “current conditions”). I did the same test(s) over and over again until I had 100% on all of them or 90%. Repetitive motion is the KEY to pass your permit test.. you can read the booklet but doing practice exams are better and easier to understand. Also, you can select your own State. 
 

 I hope my advice helps others ease their anxiety and hopefully makes you pass your exams! Good luck to you all! Let’s beat drivers anxiety together."
"I don’t even know where to start. At the beginning of the year, I was happy, I was working out, I was learning how to eat right. Then I went out for drinks with my friends in the last weekend of January, skip to the first week of February and I haven’t eaten, I have been throwing up, I am in horrible pain from my gallbladder. I have lost nearly 20 pounds from how little I was able to eat. They said get it out, so I got it taken out, and then had the worst week of my life with the worst gas pain you could not even imagine. Then slowly I start to heal and I think, maybe I might bounce back from this. But nope, as soon as I get my appetite back, it vanishes. I am losing weight again now 3 weeks post op. I also, went for a small walk in the woods with my friends and our dogs, and sure enough got bit by a tick and sure enough it’s infected.
 

 So now I’m recovering from gallbladder, on the harshest antibiotics for my tick bite, and oh? What’s that on my thigh? It’s freakin ringworm. 
 

 My anxiety has been through the roof. I’m half convinced i’m going to waste away from how much weight i’ve lost. And yeah, when I talk about this to other people they always brush me off and say wow they’re so jealous that i’m losing weight. And I get where they’re coming from, but it’s so frustrating because I did not want to lose it this way. I wanted to go to the gym and be healthy and feel strong. Food is fuel and I’m out of gas and my gas pump is broken. And i’m afraid i’m going to look scary skinny. For context i’m a 25f 5’5 at 145 and I was 165 at the beginning of the year..
 

 

 Not to mention i’m in law school about to graduate this spring and I have the bar to look forward to… I’m scared i’ll buckle if this month is already pushing me there.
 

 I’m just so scared and can’t stop obsessing about my health constantly. And it’s driving everyone I love crazy. Which is fair, it’s driving me crazy too. Please if anyone has suffered anything similar to what i’m going through, I would love to hear how you pulled through because not going to lie it’s all breaking me. 
 

 

 

 P.S. I don’t want to hear “go to the doctor” I have been to plenty of doctors about this and quite frankly not much else to be done at this point and I’m scheduled for a therapy appt next month as well. Trust me anything scary that could result from anything of this, has already been living rent free in my head."
"Hi everyone, I (25F) have recently been struggling with severe anxiety. It started late last year with a panic attack (maybe an anxiety attack?? not sure. Heavy breathing, teary eyes, feeling like my legs were numb) and has since been progressing (I have now had 5 of these). At this point I feel afraid to leave my home because I don’t want to trigger my anxiety. This past month or so I have started to have trouble sleeping as well. I had no idea anxiety had so many physical symptoms. I was initially frightened that something else was going on with me so I got blood work done, physical exams, etc. All clean. Just good ole fashion anxiety. I am kind of at my whits end with this and I just wanted to ask others if therapy really is the answer. Did you all try fixing it on your own and was that more successful? I do not know what to do and I feel like I am too young to be feeling trapped in my own body. Someone please tell me I will not be stuck like this for the rest of my life."

"In the past few years I’ve (29F) been gagging halfway through some of my meals when I go out to eat, or with friends, or when I know my anxiety is high. I’ve talked to my therapist about it and she did some research because 4 of her other clients were also experiencing the same issues as new issues. We figured out it’s a fight or flight reaction and my body is trying to avoid everything that isn’t involved with fight or flight, aka we don’t have time to chew or digest, we need to be ready to react. 
 I have a panic disorder specifically and have had the general side effects of stomach issues or chest pain etc. and my anxiety has made eating harder to do, so when I gag from eating I have to stop eating or I’ll throw up, but I’ll still be hungry and in a few hours have a headache from eating 5 bites of a meal for lunch or dinner. 
 

 *this isn’t every meal, but when it acts up it could be a few days before I feel better*
 

 I’ve tried smoothies from stores and restaurants, but they’re expensive and sometimes not open at night when I realize I need to eat and can’t stomach whole food. What are some good protein options, either a powder or recipe, that isn’t focused on weight loss, but rather just having a smoothie or shake as a meal to make sure your body gets the proper nutrition when my anxiety says no to eating? Thanks!"
"Today I finally drive by myself to a park 30 mins away from home, I changed lanes a lot (one of my biggest insecurities), drove through thought avenues, and big avenues (I was scared of them). Plus I drove my mom to the supermarket the same day. I feel so relieved and proud of myself.
 

 If a clumsy individual like me could do it you guys definitely can. Keep it up, you got this!."
"2 weeks until now, my self confidence and motivation burnt out. First, I lost my money in stock investment. It was alright from the start but after my boss gave me a hectic job for 1 week, it started to stress me out. Now one of the client was very frustrated and disappointed because I did mistake on backing her files up. One mistake and it shattered me. Maybe the stress was filing up. I can still back it up again. But it really shattered me. I literally cried because of the stress was too much. I don't have anyone to lean on. I mean I have friends and family but I can't let them feel down just I because I shared my depress feelings and thoughts. One night, I was sitting at the chair of my desk in office, it was already 7pm. My usual out is 5pm. I was sitting and staring into emptiness for 2 hours... 'I want to end this but how'. I found a scissor on top of the other desk. I grabbed it slowly and point it at my wrist... I didn't have the courage to do it. I still want to live my life... But my mind was telling me that 'it is the only way out'. I know I won't do that suicide thought, I know it. But my mind's telling me that is the only option. I hope I bounce back from this storm of my life. Thanks for my friends and family."
"i officially started my podcast a couple of days ago and my anxiety has been through the roof. ive struggled with anxiety my entire life and avoided situations that will aggravate it. this is the first time in my life (M26) that i’m actually fighting back with my anxiety. idk if i should be proud or worried because my anxiety trips has been waking me up in the middle of the night. 
 

 I was literally shaking during the first episode. im not sure if it’s because of me just thinking it’s the awful anxiety from my childhood thats coming to hunt me or just regular anxiety from starting a new venture. i smoked before the pod and was still nervous. but i still got it done which i am proud of. 
 

 whenever i feel bad anxiety, the physical reaction for me is vomiting. thats what im more afraid of. 
 

 any help with this?"
"This is a long story.. i am very thankful for people who read it.. Truly Appreciate it !!
 

 I have posted it in another forum (/rself) but now i found there are forum for social anxiety which is here. 
 

 Hi, i am 26 yo male. i am struggle with extreme blushing in my face. it happened since i was 15 at junior high school. at first i dont really care about it since my face calling me a tomato or Red Prawn 🤡 when i laugh, because it is normal to get red face when laughing right. but the first trigger happened when i was in 17 in senior, i did a presentation in front of my class and my friends pointed fingers on me saying ""youre blushing..."" or ""your face turns red"" and all laughed at me. it is so embarassing, i feel like i am very grateful to survive each day because of this. and it happened all the time until now.
 

 when i was in college, it dont happened so often because there only few of presentation, but i hear some my friends pointed out at me but only whispers. and when i was graduated in 21 y.o. i managed to work in a bank, the last 1 year in my college i dont really think about it anymore because i used to read motiavtional books or quotes.
 

 but when i was working in a bank, the 2nd trigger came in. i was doing some role play in front of a room and there are at least 40 person watching at me. i know before i walk from my table my face will turns red, and IT HAPPENED !!! i can hear all of them looking awkward at me by saying ""his face turns red..."" and any other things. i was really ashamed, i wanted to run but i cant. idk what to do i feel like im trapped at that room. and i came back to my table sitting and thinking "" i am done... i am useless.. i am a BIG DISSAPOINTMENT"" and i can feel they also think about my thought ""this guy will surely walk out first"".
 

 yesss.. i became insecure for 2 years working at that bank. i worked as a sales person which sell banking products. i knew i was silly why i take this job since it is an ""everyday meeting a new person"" or ""high social skills"" job. my performance is a big no and keep getting worst every months, until they sent me a letter to final warning because of my performance nad gave punishment to wont have any bonuses or increase wage for a year. i thought this is not a warning but a kindly message for me to resign. and i resign two months after that letter summoned.
 

 then i build my own business a small restaurant in beginning of 2020 but didnt last long because of this pandemiic. the first three months it was good enough but since covid broke out, my restaurant's business going down, until end of 2020 i close my restaurant. but this one year i dont feel any anxiety anymore, because i dont have any situations to do some presentation or some meeting which will get me anxiety.
 

 and i finally managed to braven myself to find a scholarship to pursue my master degree overseas (because i am a person who like study). I DID IT !!! after a year of preparation i finally managed to got this scholarship. it was the happiest day in my life (really!!), it was 2021 when i got this. but sadly 😔😔😔.... i cant continue after 1 month of studying. the language is to hard for me to understand. and the final trigger begin (until now)...
 

 all of my past painful memory came again, my blushing anxiety is far worst than ever. i also have another symptomps like bipolar disorder because of this and start to do something awkward or strange behavior. i used to talk alone like somekind of disorder. i mirror myself so often to saw that my face turns red or not.
 

 This blushing problems have ruined my life, i saw that this is a genetic problem from my mom that all of my brothers have it, but the strongest is with me. i feel like i am not living either dying. i dont have any income right now, such a heavy burden for my parents. i am too afraid to find a job. my options now is only to have another small business (which i dont have any feeling to do it now) or continue pursuing master degree in my own country (to not having any language problem anymore)..
 

 This spirit for pursuing my master &amp; doctoral degree is really 100% amped up hahaha 😀😀😀 but this blushing anxiety keeps blocking my mind 😔😔. To be Honest with you guys, i just wanna be a normal person. My only goal in this life is only one, i want to be a useful person for this world, i want to donate my life &amp; my time to find new discovery in studying (especially science) for this world to become a better place. This is TRULY my motivation in this life. i dont care if im not rich or anything, i just want to make myself useful for others. i am sorry if this sounds so childish but that's me. but still... i cannot imagine when i graduate and become a lecturer. everyday i will talk in front of others and you can imagine wthat'll happen.. 😔😔
 

 idk what to do guys, i read all books, articles, tried some methods like ACT (Acceptance Commitment Theraphy) to accept my blushing. it worked a little but my fear is like a single dwarf fighting LORD SAURON 😔😔. right now i only sit in front of my laptop doing nothing and wasting my time, dont have any friends and any income.
 

 if you guys have any opinions or this experience, i will really appreciate it. i will reach you asap."
"Dear all, my partner lives with anxiety disorder and experiences heart palpitations during the night almost regularly. I know that she has a sensitive stomach and it doesn’t agree with most spicy and oily foods. I also understand that those with GERD tend to suffer from anxiety and heart palpitations. Does anyone else experience this and how do you approach your nights?"
"I'm 25 and suffer with anxiety along with other health issues that limit my ability to function in ""normal"" life. Though now feel I'm at a point I feel stable enough to start looking into how I can sustain myself. Does anyone have an idea of a type of job I can go into that I could potentially do from anywhere? From home would be ideal too as I'm not allowed to drive and transport can be a big issue. I wouldn't mind studying a bit but I can't really afford to be in education for years and years as idk how I would be able to get money whilst I do it. 
 Has anyone here found anything suitable and manageable? Or any ideas?
 Thanks in advance hope you're all having a decent weekend"

"I get major anxiety when I talk to attractive females
 

 I'm 29 (m) and still get nervous like I'm in middle tryna hit on women. I think the official term is fear of intamacy.. just sucks cause I'm really not a bad looking guy. I should be getting girls left n right.
 

 Why do I get anxiety? I've got a big fear of being rejected. It's like I can see myself getting nervous and fumbling my words before I go in. Even if I don't have any preconceived notions that I'll be rejected, I feel confident going in, but when I approach her I'll start to break down. If she even mentions ""her boyfriend"" I quit talking, even though I know that's a total shit-test. Women are telling me I need to get over myself.. like this is some kind of 'ego' thing. But the reality is that I am the most modest fuckin person I know, an I still have trouble trying get w women who are even less attractive.
 

 I really just feel like I'm not emotionally mature for my age. It's like my game is still stuck middle school.
 

 

 This is so fucking aggrevating because I have nobody to blame but myself. And idk how to solve this problem.
 

 Any feedback is appreciated."
"I am a truck driver and took a 12 day home time and I came back super anxious and paranoid for no reason. I had this weird obsession that someone poisoned my water in my truck while I was gone and had what I thought at the time was a heart attack. I called 911 and was picked up by an ambulance my heart rate was spiked and my heart was palpitating, I got complete tunnel vision while driving and thought oh my god I've been poisoned and I guess that's what really set off the full blown panic attack. I'm 25 and the hospital did a CT scan on my brain, blood work, urine, x-ray on my chest. Everything is clear and I have no health issues besides the heart palpitations. Fast forward the next day and I have another one for no reason at all, I think it's all the negative thinking and not knowing what was wrong with me at the time. Went back to the hospital and once again they said I'm fine and everything's normal. Now it's a week later and I get these body chills that make me a bit dizzy and I kind of shoo them away and it seems to stop, I also get woken up with a dizzy feeling like the room is spinning, I'm assuming I'm having a mini panic attack in my sleep. I'm very tired and just out of it a week later. Anyone else have this happen to them? I have to go back to work tomorrow and Im just nervous it will happen again."
"So I'm trying to decide what sort of doctor to see since I'm considering medication for my anxiety. I've thought about going to my regular primary care doctor or my neurologist since I'm already familiar with them but I'm also thinking it might be better to see someone who specializes in mental disorders, particularly anxiety, instead.
 

 So I was wondering, what is your experience with psychiatrists? What do you talk to them about? Do they run any tests? 
 

 If you haven't seen a psychiatrist but have gotten help from a different doctor in regards to medication, how did that go?
 

 Also I'm aware that psychiatrists are more the medical side of help and psychologists are the ones who do therapy. I already have a therapist so I'm looking for help beyond just therapy. Any information is appreciated :&gt;"
I am a 28 year old male and last thursday i got my first job. It is at panera bread. My aunt works there and helped me get a job there. I work as a dishwasher and rarely see the customers. My coworkers are friendly and talkative. I dont know what to say and have trouble interacting. My coworkers talk to me and i barely talk. I also have a speech impediment. I would like some advuce in how to stop being socially awkward.
"***TLDR: had a breakup, severe low self esteem issues, severe anxiety and feeling like breaking down when i should be having fun, feeling like i will be alone forever, finding it paralyzing to talk to this girl that might leave byron soon. help***
 

 after the break up i have no idea what to do with my life so i ended up leaving the mountains for Byron Bay.
 

 (a place i had been when i was single and had a great physique)
 

 i dont have any friends in general and i am 28.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 **the last two days me and this girl kept locking eyes but the most i could ever get out was hi with barely a smile on my face.**
 

 **i was working up the courage to speak to her on new years eve but she left and couldn't find her even after hours of looking. i feel like what i am doing is pathetic and i should just quit.**
 

 i am told i am physically attractive by a lot of people but i just feel pathetic and my heart is starting to really hurt especially today i feel like i am on the verge of a breakdown in one of the most party based destinations in Australia. i am really not coping.
 

 **Q: does anyone know anything about creating a alter ego and has that ever helped get past paralyzing Anxiety of making friends or picking up?**
 

 **Where you ever able to silence the pain or depression?**
 

 if you have anything that could help me not breakdown i am seriously struggling just want connection"
"Sorry if this isn't quite the best sub to post this-- it's not due to anxiety, but it is definitely *giving me* anxiety. Anyway it's been over 3 weeks since I came off beta blockers, had a really hard time quitting them, seems as though I may have been hypersensitive-- either way, it's left me with an inability to handle adrenaline, and so now when I climax, my heart rate easily reaches 190~200, if I can even finish due to the intensity. Not even a minute after, it's back down in the high 70s. I'm 29 years old btw. Should I be worried? Should I just refrain from sexual activity entirely until I can see a cardiologist?
 

 (I was given beta blockers for palpitations that turned out to be caused by iron pills, there's no known previous issues with my heart.)"

"I wanted to rant. I have been overthinking so much lately because I kind of had the relationship talk with a girl I went on two dates with. I never thought I would get that far, and now I'm just thinking how I'm leading her on, cos she doesn't know how fucked up I really am.
 

 Meanwhile my neediness is through the roof. I know not to get attached and that things probably won't work out, but since I haven't dated at all, my brain is going through all sorts of fantasies with this girl, over which i have no control. 
 

 I'm committed to working on myself. I've read books on SA and I'm doing practices. I'm talking to people. I know it's hard work and I've taken full responsibility for my life. I'm trying to love myself more and accept myself the way I am - having SA. But it's just hard. Sometimes it gets so hard I think I'm nearing my breaking point. 
 

 For all of you out there struggling with your SA, I want to hug you and let you know, I'm struggling every day as well. I hope you find the strength in youself to fight for a better life despite your SA. I hope you can find the courage to love yourself enough to not give in to SA and do all the things you want to do this year.

"It’s 1:30 am and here I am awake. I never used to have issues falling asleep, only waking up early. Now I can’t fall asleep and I still wake up early. I don’t know what is causing this, it just started last night. I just took melatonin so hopefully it knocks me out soon. Does anyone else struggle with this? I don’t even feel anxious, I just don’t know why I can’t sleep."
"Last night, I thought to myself, "" I wonder what it's like to pay for porn? ""
 I decided to subscribe to EvilAngel.
 I was having the time of my life watching all of the new releases that aren't on PornHub yet. 
 It cost 9.95 a month.
 I learned today that after the first month it gets more expensive.
 I also have Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon Prime subscriptions so I started to worry about the price going forward.
 The idea that I might lose access to the new releases frightened me.
 It was the fear of losing the new releases that got triggered me and I'm doing better since I've realised that.
 I love it, but if I can't pay, I can't pay.
 There's still PornHub."

"Is silence something that you think about? That you’re aware of? 
 I was really surprised to find out that my sister never thinks about whether a social situation turns silent. That must be a really easy way to live. She’s also quite a chatty person. 
 On the other hand I’ve always been aware of the silence and felt the need to fill it up, and I’ve learned to make small talk and ask questions - I think - but I’m still incredibly aware anytime there is silence. 
 I’ve recently started dating a person who also has some anxiety issues and social anxiety in particular I think, and he’s also on the quieter side. I think we’re really good together but it’s hard when we’re both so aware of the talking/not talking side of things. 
 

 Thoughts?"
"I’ve (25F) started dating a sweet person (26M) about two months who also has mild/moderate social anxiety. It’s great because I feel like he understands me a lot better than my exes. He’s much better than I am at communicating about anxiety. I manage my anxiety but can’t really talk about it. 
 

 

 Anyways it’s great because we get each other, but we’re also obvs anxious about each other and about things like how much we’re both talking etc. We end up basically drinking together on a constant basis which makes it easier but also not a good idea on the long term. 
 

 Anyone has had any similar experiences? Would be very appreciated x"
"Hi!
 

 I tested positive for Covid last Friday the 31st.
 

 So far I have been ok, I had a fever and cough but it is almost gone. 
 

 I have been diagnosed with GAD and I tend to have some depression as well.
 

 The issue now in my 4th day is that my anxiety and/or Covid are making me feel weird mentally. I feel like I’m DP/DR, when I’m trying to fall asleep I start feeling weird sensations and seeing weird things with my eyes closed. I feel a bit disoriented. 
 

 

 Has anyone else had this with Covid and anxiety ? 
 

 

 Any tips and/or advice greatly appreciated."

"In September I went from 20mg Paroxetine to 30mg Paroxetine and waited 10 weeks to see how it would work. All year I have had weeks where I am crippled with anxiety and depression but before this year the 20mg Paroxetine has worked wonders (Started in 2017). Fast-forward to after the 10 weeks of the up dose of Paroxetine and I still had days where I was not wanting to live if this is how I was going to feel for the rest of my life. My psychiatrist then started me on 150Mg Wellbutrin along with my 30mg Paroxetine as well as starting CBT and I just finished week 4 of the new meds. 
 

 I can definitely tell a difference in my overall mental health. I have found that meditation in the mornings that I am overwhelmed helps me to get back to feeling present. The problem I am seeing is that I don't allow my self to truly get excited. I will have feelings or thoughts of something that gets me to start feeling normal again.... BUT then there is this voice in my head telling me its not for long. I keep thinking back to this past year and how low I got and it instantly pushes away any excitement I am feeling. I get afraid that I will wake up one morning and start feeling like I was this past year and I can say its the scariest feeling in the world. 
 

 Has anyone experienced these thoughts or feelings and have some input on how they might have gotten these thoughts to subside?"
"i (29f) go Wednesday for a consultation on my wisdom teeth surgery. I’ve been pretty calm up until today. today my anxiety has hit full force and I’m terrified. 
 

 two things im worried about, waking up during surgery and two, dying. 
 

 i keep thinking things will go wrong and I’ll die and leave my boys without a mom
 

 and it sucks. it sucks so bad that my anxiety is destroying my mental right now. 
 

 i have come so far the last year and now it’s hitting hard. I’ve put this surgery off for so long bc of anxiety but I can’t keep putting it off. 
 

 long story short, they have to pull all 4 wisdom teeth and possibly a back molar if they can’t root canal it."
"I have an embarrassing, extreme amount high blood pressure and pulse every time I visit the doctor for any reason. It's not exactly ""white-coat"" syndrome, as I'm not nervous about the actual medical appointment, only the specific act of getting my blood pressure/heart rate taken. I guess it's mostly me being worried that they'll try to force me to the hospital or to get invasive cardiac testing done or try to make me wear a bunch of heart rate/BP tracking equipment all the time even though I'm 25 and healthy and clearly not overweight. The numbers are always extreme every time, and entirely due to anxiety as they're always much lower at home. Blood pressure is typically around 160/90 to 170/100 or higher and pulse has been as high as 150-160+. Waiting and then retaking it later in the appointment doesn't do any good and often makes it worse. I've dealt with this issue since I was 13-14 years old, so the majority of my life, and it's been like this every single time I go to the doctor for any reason without exceptions. I have no idea how to stop it. Most doctors haven't made a big deal about it when I say I just get nervous getting my blood pressure taken but it's extremely embarrassing. Any advice?"
"I’m so tired of feeling alone with my anxiety symptoms. It feels like not one single person has ever felt the sensations I have felt. Yes I know everyone is different but usually you meet at least SOMEONE who feels the same. Maybe I’m not describing it right, idk :( but it makes me feel like the doctors really are missing something and I’m dying :( I’m so afraid. I truly don’t know what else to do."
"Hey guys. I (F25) have had on and off anxiety for majority of my life. Experienced my first panic attack when I was 6, and have experienced many more as time went on. 
 

 While growing up, some of my anxiety made sense, since I was going through a lot of troubling situations. However, what didn’t make sense was my out of the blue episodes, where I could be eating cereal and suddenly I’m struggling to breathe. 
 

 As time went on, my anxiety came in waves… or phases. And when referencing my anxiety, this is always paired with insomnia and shortness of breath or breathing hyper awareness. 
 

 Thinking about it now, I think the root of my insomnia and anxiety is my breathing. The moment I become too aware, I can’t go back to breathing naturally. It’s probably the worst feeling in the world, but this fixation makes me lose sleep, which is paired with anxiety and depression. 
 

 To circle back to the meds, I was taking trazodone and Zoloft for about 2 weeks until I stopped cold Turkey.  
 

 Why? 
 

 Well, during the first week, I felt absolutely amazing. I had no panic, no fixations or anything. Until about 1.5 weeks in, I had probably the most intense panic attack in my life. I woke up in the middle of the night in full panic mode. I don’t recall having a nightmare or anything of the sort. 
 

 Since then, a couple days later, it is NYE around 3 am and I completely start hallucinating. I have taken psychedelics in my teenaged years, so the visuals were pretty familiar. As you can imagine, this also sent me into a panic attack.
 

 That night I decided I was no longer taking Zoloft. I researched the issue and it seems like a rare interaction that can occur for folks who are sensitive to the drug. 
 

 With all this said, does anyone else have similar symptoms such as, insomnia, shortness of breath/breathing fixation that leads to anxiety and panic?
 

 If so, what are you taking? What works for you?"
"Not all the but I have noticed that when I drink tea before falling asleep.
 

 I fall asleep for like 20-30 minutes sometimes maybe like 2-3 hours. I wake up after a certain period of time and I feel so many weird sensations. Just know I woke up shaking and it happens often with tea.
 

 I woke up shaking badly and it is hard to stop shaking, I usually go to the bathroom and when I come back and try to go back to sleep…. My mind starts doing weird things…
 

 I start to feel palpitations, I start to feel my belly bloated and like releasing gases Internally if that makes any sense, that’s ok and actually doable.
 

 What I can’t stand is when I close my eyes to fall back asleep… I start seeing weird figures, forms, things, sometimes my mind tends to feel like these forms, etc start expanding into 2 and continue growing by the power of 2. So a flash of light becomes 2 then 4 etc 
 And it drives me nuts… to the point I can’t fall back asleep and feeling so so tired.
 

 

 I want to sleep I miss sleeping I don’t know what’s wrong… I have GAD but this is somewhat new.
 

 Anyone else ?? Any tips? I would really appreciate it 
 

 I feel so desperate."
"I'm 25 and I still don't have a job (I'm terrified of the whole process). I've just applied for two jobs!! My anxiety is skyrocketing and if they call me on the phone all of a sudden I could probably die, but I did it!! I'm scared, I'm very new to this, but I've made the first step. Wish me luck guys!"
"To start with, I am (26F) medically diagnosed with ADHD and general anxiety disorder. On top of that, I have anxious attachment style as well, if you are into it. Meaning: Breakups are fucking destroying for me and I exclusively end up being the dumpee, since being attached to someone and then breaking up with them is the hardest thing ever for me. I am in therapy as well for about 3 months but I am out of the country now due to holidays and had to take a break with my sessions. 
 

 I had a breakup with my ex boyfriend of 1.5 years (30M) about 3 weeks ago. It was somehow mutual, though he initiated it and the idea was that we have some big incompatibilities in our future plans (I am a big city girl, he is a rural town person who is looking to settle down there in the very near future) as well as general communication issues due to us coming from different countries, having different personalities in some areas. It was very emotional with a lot of tears on both sides and we left it at hoping we will find our way back to each other if it is meant to be. Though he almost explicitly said that wished to be with someone else, who could speak his native language, was born into a rural town like himself and does not mind moving back there with him. So, not me.
 

 We immediately went no contact and kept it like that also during the holidays. He is not very active on social media thankfully, so I did not have to try a lot not to stalk him. This is my 3rd breakup and somehow not even the worst, so I know the basics of not making it even harder for myself such as mindless stalking. However, last night I had to check my Spotify followers for another reason and saw that he was still following me there and he got someone new following him. (It used to be 0 with me unfollowing him, so seeing that it went up to 1 made me curious) It was a woman and I was unfortunately able to track down who she is. He does not follow her back though and they don't seem to have each other on Facebook, which is the only social media platform my ex has. 
 

 She is a very good friend of a very good friend (also a woman) of my ex, who lives in the same city as her. I was not able to find out much else but they seem to have an almost identical music taste, something that we also do have together. This sent me down to a spiral. I automatically assumed that she is everything that I am not, he found his soulmate in her and has already moved on or on his way to move on. She is coming from the same country as him, meaning that they share a native language, she is already living in a smaller town so possibly open to moving to a rural town with him, they have a very similar music taste and they have a mutual friend, who happens to be a great person actually, so the new girl must be great as well! She looks amazing and I assume that he must be definitely into her given that they somehow ended up meeting.
 

 The conclusions I have jumped into are killing me. There may not even be anything romantic going on between them, I know. The fact that they followed each other recently is making me think whether he visited their city or she visited our city. Why did she follow him but not the other way around? Were they fooling around in her apartment and he took her phone/smart tv and just simply followed her? but most importantly, is it possible that he moved on so quickly, while i am still in my hometown and wallowing in my sorrow? It has barely been 3 weeks. If he is to move on with her so quickly, then he never actually loved me at all. If he wanted to end up with someone else so fundamentally different than me, then why did he lead me on for 1.5 years, met my family, became so much engraved into my life, went through so many hardships with me and made. me think we could have a future together? 
 

 The simple fact that I don't know what is going on in his life is killing me. I am aware that the relationship ended up for a reason and it is probably for the best that we are no longer together. I contemplated breaking up with him multiple times as well but never brought myself to doing it and I stayed for the sake of good things.Quite honestly, I was not even sure if I was in love with him until he brought up breaking up. I try to cheer myself up by thinking that the future is unknown and any other great thing can happen to me now, but the simple fact that he could already be enjoying his life so soon after me is making me incredibly upset. Though selfish, I want him to be upset over it as well and think of me as often as I do think of him. 
 

 I swore to myself that I would not check his spotify or FB again I know nothing good would come out of it, but how can I stop assuming that this is already taking place and is not just in my mind? I also believe that thoughts create reality, so if i keep on assuming that he has moved on already, soon enough i will discover that he actually indeed moved on. I want to prevent this. 
 

 I want to be at peace with the idea that we may never see each other again and we both will end up with different people, but I have this horrible anxiety in my chest telling that i am the only one who is suffering, I want to be able to prevent overthinking and this ensuing anxiety. I know I have zero control over what he does with his life now and whom he meets, and I want to make peace with this fact and focus on my life instead. Anyone got any tips?"
"So I've been on the recovery path from a pretty acute case of anxiety that started in September. 
 

 I've worked out, almost entirely jogging with occasional jumping jacks and push ups, through this journey. I've occasionally had twitching episodes and hypnotic jerks (pretty spicy ones) that would last a couple days here and there. Mostly the jerks would happen when I was under more stress such as traveling for work. But this whole episode started in the middle of a two week break from work over the holidays when I had nothing but gaming to do. Also to note the jerks would happen anywhere from legs, arms, neck, and entire abdomen. 
 

 Lately, these jerks have gotten worse and so has the twitching. I liked the twitching at first because I thought and think it is a sign I'm loosening my tension. My tension has been AWFUL and the primary cause for a lot of my anxiety symptoms. I can feel I'm overall less tense, stretching doesn't cause the pain it did and what not. The twitching is everywhere but mostly focused in my thighs and arms. 
 

 The twitching and jerking is causing difficulty sleeping. I've not gotten to sleep before midnight in over a week now. I've had to start taking my vistaril again in order to power sleep through it, my muscle relaxers don't seem to do anything. 
 

 Has anyone else dealt with this? Anything to help? I stretch a lot, used a tens machine, drink lots of water, been getting decent rest despite the late bedtimes, walk, etc."
"I only smoked for 5 months, I quit in September and ever since then, I've had issues with my health. First started out with chest tightness, that went away after a month, but for the past 3 months, I wake up every single morning with a sore throat and like I have sinus drainage. My sense of smell and taste has also been affected as well. Chicken, my urine and fecal matter also smell off. I've also been losing weight faster than usual. My lymphnode on the back of my neck is swollen. I went to the ENT and they said my sinuses and throat look normal. I'm scared that I may have some form of cancer that I am unaware of but starting to show early stages. I don't know what to do. or any advice?"
what are the chances of getting cancer after only smoking cigarettes for 5 months total?
"Just as the title says. I feel hurt. I don't get it. It's 7 Days to Die a survival crafting game where zombies show up in horde and you have to make a base and pray you survive. We found out about the game years ago. This is important at least to me. I've been wanting to play this game since we found out about it. It's right up my alley and I brought it up a lot. Last year a friend of his bought him a copy and they were playing. I was kind of upset but how could I be when he didn't purchase it for himself. I was able to get a taste for the game on his copy when he wasn't playing and absolutely fell in love. When we had money I was able to get a copy but by then his interest had run it's course. I did get him to play with me sometimes but I mainly played alone. The option of playing the game with the buddies never came up. This was over a year ago. A new update was released recently and I have been anxiously awaiting it. I got back into the game and put a couple dozen hours in by myself. At the same time, I notified my husband hoping the new content would entice him to come play with the game with me but it didnt and returned to playing alone on a public PVE server. I asked a lot I try not to be a bother but I DID ask. I don't know why but one of his other buddies started playing too and that enticed him and the original buddy from before got a server. We're all on the server but they hardly speak to me and he only does stuff with them. They make plans for the base, for items and to craft, they send each other on resource farming missions or trader missions. They make sure they all have new updated weapons. Mostly they are all just included. I left one time and no one even noticed. It's kind of pointless for me to be there. I feel like the little sister begrudgingly included. Given a controller without batteries, lol. If you had younger siblings you know what I am talking about. I feel horrible for ever doing that. Anytime I suggest something or ask a question or offer help I'm literally ignored even though my partner is 5 feel from me. I jokingly asked if my mic was off because he didn't react at all. I just hide away somewhere else in the house(me playing with them last an hour or two of me doing exactly what I was doing alone on the other server but on theirs only thing is all the work on my 'Bannered Mare' remake on that map is all gone to come play with them and they don't even play with me.) The little bit of joy I had for the game robbed from me by myself. 
 

  I don't know what to do. It's a dumb catch 22. I had more hours in the game than him and now he has more but they're all mostly with those guys. I kind of hate this game now. 
 

 I do all the same things they do in the game. I just don't talk. I really like building bases. I told them this. I really like looting. I did get a chance to say this. I really really don't like inviting myself to things. It's a fucking video game. 
 

 Im socially awkward and extremely anxious. I'm 25 and have tried several methods of help for this but I've literally always been this way. I try to put myself out there and make friends but for me half the time it ends in a panic attack and tears. It's just my body's response and if I don't feel safe it's never going to go away. If I am trying to any extent I am TRYING. He knows this.
 

 Good night Reddit I am angry sad."
"Hi all!
 

 When i get an anxiety attack, i often dont like taking a valium for it because i know that the valium will stay in effect for 5 hours, when my attacks or the worst of it mostly last for 30 mins (obviously depends on the attack).
 My question is, are there any other medications out there that have the same effect of taking away the attack, but the effects dont last as long?
 

 Thanks!"
"I am in Home Office right now, so it was in a conference call, not even with camera on, just me talking freely for 10 minutes about an analysis i did. propably sounds like the easiest thing ever for someone without a social anxiety disorder, but I couldn't sleep much the night before and woke up drenched in sweat and in panic. I don't even know why I was so scared about it, just my anxiety going insane i guess. When they called me to start my presentation it felt like my heart is going to explode. 
 

 But I was so surprised when I started talking with a strong voice and even managed to make a few pauses and put emphasis on words and explanations. You know, not just speedrunning through it with a shaky voice. Feeling really relieved right now and proud, I'm happy that I forced myself to do it and hope that I will remember it as a positive experience that helps me in the future :)"

I really wanna be happy for him about this nex esperience , but I’m just so scared of what could happen in our relationship and I don’t know how to trust him going out to college parties and studf. I have a lot of trust issues that I’m already trying to work on,, Does anyone have any tips on trusting and on long distance while in college and how to not freak out any other second???"

"So my (31M) close friend (25F), is struggling at the moment and I wanted to do something really nice for her to help her feel better. I was going to write her a letter with reasons in it why she is an awesome person and all her positives. So if she is feeling sad or low then she can read it and hopefully it will remind her how amazing and loved she is by so many people. 
 

 She is a super nice person and she can't seem to catch a break with anything over the past couple of years and I just think she deserves something really nice.
 

 Do you guys think this is a good idea or could you suggest anything else that may be better?"
"**Background**
 

 I am 29F and I just passed my driver's test yesterday. I was/am very very scared of driving. Since mid-2021 I have been getting treatment for depression and anxiety. My mental health issues have been so debilitating that I have been unable to work. I needed something in my life that I could find rewarding, and I chose to work towards getting my licence and work on driving because I knew it would help me to feel an amazing sense of achievement if I could do it. My partner and I are also thinking about starting a family soon, and I had this sense of ""If not now, how will I get it after I have a baby?""
 

 I did initially get my learner's permit in high school (2008?), but I witnessed quite a devastating crash in one of my first outings and developed driving anxiety. My parents also weren't too interested in teaching me to drive so it was easy to let it go and just be comfortable and not do it. I had another attempt at learning to drive in 2020, but I struggled to manage my anxiety and depression and didn't attempt again until 2021.
 

 **How did other people react to you not driving?**
 

 My family and friends constantly treated me not getting my licence like a ""failure to launch"". I was badgered by family as I got older, but no one wanted to help me learn. My partner and I got together in 2016 and he was more than happy to drive and didn't care that I didn't have my licence, so I never felt pressured to get my licence. He was more than happy to teach me but didn't push the issue if I didn't feel up to it when the time came to practice (which always happened).
 

 It was rarely ever an issue to get to work because I had a lot of generous family members who would take me and I could catch public transport. But my coworkers and boss definitely looked down on me not driving, and I had quite an embarrassing e-mail exchange with my boss and coworkers cc'd in, in which the initial issue wasn't even about me driving (along the lines of, ""We don't ask people to do tasks that they're unable to do, just like XX isn't able to drive so we wouldn't ask her to do anything that involves driving""). So basically over the years I have felt quite judged and treated less-than by family, friends and peers for being unable to drive.
 

 **Location?**
 

 I am located in NSW, Australia. In my state, people over 25 years old do not need to complete a certain number of hours, they can attempt the test when they are ready. My test took about 40 minutes from start to finish.
 

 **How long did it take me to prepare for the test and how many lessons did I have?**
 

 12 weeks of actively driving - I estimate I had about 20 or 25 hours behind the wheel before I did my test. However 1 hour of driving with a driving instructor is weighted at 3 hours for the first 10 hours for learners (if under 25 here have to complete 120 hours of driving before their test). So weighted maybe 50 hours.
 

 I decided to try driving again mid-October 2021, with my partner. We realized quickly that I would need a driving instructor and got one in the last week of October. I had weekly lessons (11 in total). Six lessons were probably 1.5 hours long, and the other 5 were an hour. I only did 30 min of driving with my partner between lessons, sometimes didn't have the chance to practice at all between lessons.
 

 **What was my test like?**
 

 My test was about 40 minutes long, and I did my test at 11am. Thankfully the rain held off and it was clear during my test. It was nerve wracking sitting with the examiner. I made a signaling error that I had never made before prior to my test. I stuffed up my reverse parallel park (not the worst one I have done, but still got a position error). I missed one head check. I know that I drove overly cautiously for me (my partner said he was sweating bullets when he watched me leave the testing center and I didn't take the first gap I could have taken). I also stuffed up my park when we returned to the testing center (my poor partner was having a heart attack, lol).
 

 When I finished the test the examiner basically ran out of my car, didn't say anything to me. My partner came over to me and he said I looked like a was going to pass out, and unhappy. He thought for sure I had failed as in his test (many years ago) the examiner told him the result as they pulled in to the testing center. We waited together inside with my driving instructor to get the result. I think I would have preferred to get the result privately if it had been disappointing.
 

 I didn't know how I did at the end of my test - I had a sense that I did well, but maybe didn't do enough to pass. I knew of two errors that I made on the test itself, and I was wondering how many other errors I made that I didn't know about. I had also had an incredibly stressful day leading up to the test, and I also had to take the test in a car I had driven in once before for 15 minutes because we identified that one of the indicators on my car was out before we went to the testing center (one on the mirror, the front &amp; back indicators were fine). I'm glad that I was able to borrow a family member's car - otherwise I wouldn't have been able to take the test. **SO CHECK THAT YOUR CAR IS ROADWORTHY DAYS BEFORE THE TEST!!**
 

 I got 95% overall which I was very happy with - 90% is a pass here without a certain number of serious/minor fail items.
 

 **My 10 top tips on learning how to drive:**
 

 Okay so these are my top tips and what helped me the most to get my licence:
 

 1. I developed a driving plan with my psychologist and driving instructor to keep me on track with realistic goals and end date for my licence to work towards. For example, I wanted to get my licence by Feb 2022 and I started in the last week of Oct 2021. But I had goals in between - I wanted to be able to drive to the shops 5-10 minutes away after my third lesson.
 2. I wanted to foster a feeling of confidence and success from participating in driving. I didn't want others to be patronizing but to celebrate my success of going driving. My partner and I went out for brunch after each lesson and I loved it and always looked forward to it. It's about associating positive feelings with the lesson.
 3. I found a patient and kind driving instructor. You might have to do some shopping around for this because a driving instructor not equipped to deal with your anxiety will hurt your progress. For example my driving instructor staggered my entry into traffic, just dipping my toes in and knew quiet streets to take me. As a teenager when I tried to learn with my parents alone, they put me in traffic when I was petrified and wasn't ready, I had a near miss with a collision and screaming parents, and was too scared to go again.
 4. I was prepared to pay for regular lessons. Driving lessons can be expensive (where I live $65 per hour), but I have had 11 lessons (1 x per week started off maybe first 6 as 1.5 hour lessons, the rest were 1 hr). These were the key to my progress. It may also help to get a driving instructor that has experience teaching older students (though I will say this wasn't the case for me - my driving instructor mainly taught teens but was very good at managing my driving anxiety). I think it would have helped me though because I wouldn't have felt like such an anomaly as an adult learning to drive as my instructors main anecdotes were with kids.
 5. Be aware that driving with anxiety is not easy. I get severe knots in my stomach and panic a bit before I get in the car, though the panic severity has lessened with experience and time. I have a lot of nightmares about driving. Every week I felt sick in the lead up to my lesson. It's only because my partner encouraged me with understanding that I could push past the feelings.
 6. I found scheduling lessons in the morning (after school zones ended) to be the most helpful for me. The less time I had to back out of the lesson and ruminate on it through the day was best for me
 7. Try to not feel like a burden when asking others who are willing to teach you to take you for a drive. There have been a couple of times where this has happened to me, and as I was already feeling like a burden because of depression and anxiety, it really impacted my willingness to continue driving.
 8. Do not force yourself to be the one ""driving everywhere"" through the week. Dealing with anxiety and driving has been really hard, and I have not taken every single opportunity to drive because I was panicking to the point where it was dangerous for me to be behind the wheel. I took every opportunity to drive where I felt confident &amp; capable, and now I pretty much volunteer to drive with my partner when we go out.
 9. Keep in mind that learning to drive as an adult is different than learning to drive as a teen, and a double-edged sword. I am so much more aware of the dangers/consequences of driving as an adult than a teen. The negative: It honestly made me so scared to get into the car to start off with, I had a panic attack in a quiet street thinking now I was the ""pilot of the death trap"". The positive: As you build confidence these feelings will lessen, but just be aware that most older drivers learning to drive don't have the ""invincible"" feelings of teens. This overall will make you a safer and more competent driver.
 10. Consider learning in an automatic rather than manual because it's easier and a bit more intuitive. I learnt in an automatic and I don't think I couldn't have managed a manual (and I love my automatic car!)

 I hope these tips help. Good luck everyone!!!"
"Hi guys,
 I'm struggling right now.
 I don't know whether I should go to urgent care to get a dr to listen to my heart or just let it go and say it's anxiety.
 

 I suffer from anxiety everyday. I suffer from panic attacks often. 
 

 I went to the the dr more than I can count on my fingers in 2021.
 

 For the first time in my life in 2021 I've struggled with the worst heart palpitations.
 

 I've had 2 EKGS and a stress test done.
 

 My family dr thought it was all anxiety but to be sure she said to visit the cardiologist. So I did. 
 Cardiologist reviewed my stress test and decided no further testing is needed and told me it is all psychological/emotional/anxiety related. 
 

 30 min ago I had the worst heart palpitations ever lasting for 3- seconds.
 Pounding, flipping, flopping, skip beats.
 I thought I was going to die.
 

 Should I go urgent care or is this just anxiety? 
  
 No one around me understands what im going through.
 

 All day today I've had heart palpitations. I thought my heart stopped for a second even. I don't know. 
 

 I don't know if my life is in jeopardy or not :(
 

 I'm still having heart palpitations right now here and there. I'm sweating. I'm so worried.
 

 Can someone have these heart problems and it be anxiety or should I go right now to urgent care?"
"I tested positive Dec / 31.. 27M double vacceo Pfizer, still wasn’t time for my booster. It started with a really bad cough, fever (38.5), body aches, like resllly bad body aches, shivering, chills and what not .
 

 Tested negative the Wednesday and Thursday but I had a scratchy throat.
 

 I think I’m today on day 7-8. 
 

 Cough is almost gone and I have had no fever in the past 2-3 days. My congestion is on and off.
 

  The thing that bothers me is being super fatigued, to the point I feel really sleepy.. and then I get in this state where I feel half awake half asleep.
 

 I also feel like I can’t breath perfectly. My o2 is ok though.. it is always ranging between 97-99.
 

 I have been having really bad back pain since the afternoon, the pain is mostly in my shoulders and upper back. I also noticed a Bit of pain on my right side between the rib cage and the belly. 
  
 Not only that, but I have noticed weird palpitations and sensations that there’s like a jump in my heart, sort of like fluttering. 
 

 

 Sometimes when I get the palpitation sensation, I feel like there’s a pause when I breath for a split of a second. Really weird feeling.
 

 I have generalized anxiety and it is making it worse.
 

 Anyone else ? 
 

 What are your experiences your tips?
 

 I’m scared!"

"So I know heart palpitations are common, but I’m writing to see how they make others feel when they experience them? Does it just feel like your heart is skipping beats? Does it flutter? Do you feel it in more parts of your body? I’m desperate in feeling like I’m alone in how my palpitations make me feel. I’ve been to a cardiologist already for anyone that’s going to ask, had multiple halter monitors, stress test, echos and everything and it’s healthy. They’ve told me it’s because of anxiety but I don’t think they are understanding how these sensations make me feel. It’s not just my heart skipping beats in my chest. But yeah, enough ranting, can everyone tell me how they make you physically feel?"
"Hi :)
 

 I am wondering what other peoples experiencs are with heart palpitations.
 

 Mine are so bad and I had a really bad episode yesterday where it felt like my heart had stopped and pounded at the same time. 
 

 I had 2 EKGS done and a stress test done. The cardiologist reviewed the results of these 2 tests and said no further testing is needed and my palpitations are due to physiological/anxiety and she believes hormonal as well. 
 

 I am 26 years old and have horrible horrible anxiety and panic attacks.
 

 My palpitations yesterday were so different in the sense I thought my heart was going to stop.
 

 Just wondering if anyone gets bad palpitations like this or if it is just me going undiagnosed with something.
 

 Thanks so much!"

"Hello all, I’m 25F and excited to have made the decision to move in with my beloved gf who I’m going to be proposing to later this year. The trouble is that, to do so, I need to get out of my current lease/roommate situation that just isn’t working out. All of it is triggering my anxiety so badly and I just don’t know what to do because just thinking about it has me on the precipice of an anxiety attack. 
 

 Honestly, I haven’t even been able go into my own apartment for nearly two months because of the anxiety. I’ve been living with my gf whose lease ends late Feb while still paying rent (my lease ends June). I have a long history of PTSD related to feeling unsafe in my own home (abusive parent, roommate who credibly threatened to kill me, neglected as a child) and all of it is triggered when I go to my apartment where I feel very uncomfortable and my roommate exhibits a lot of the same patterns as the one who wanted to hurt me. I texted her a month ago that I want to move in with my gf and am open to taking over our current lease plus paying for moving costs, or her finding a new roommate, or whatever other option she’d be open to but she hasn’t responded. It took me weeks to build up to even sending that text and I’m going to send another one this week but I’m getting the sense I need to talk to her in person. Problem there is that, like I said, my anxiety makes me panic just being in my apartment or thinking of confronting the situation. Doesn’t help that my roommate will go into her room and shut the door anytime that I do go into my apartment, respond to me when I say hi, or respond to my texts.
 

 I want so badly to move in with my gf and get off this lease but I can’t get past my anxiety. I plan on asking a doc for some Xanax to help with the panic attacks but I just don’t know how to get through this situation. My gf is so supportive and has suggested to help me draft texts and is open to so many options for moving but I am just having such a hard time. I feel I am letting her down and I don’t know what to say when her family asks about how our plans are going. Advice appreciated."

"I generally don't subscribe to these kinds of mental health reddits because they are often full of distressed/hopeless people who need an outlet and I realised that seeing so many of those kinds of posts can really make my mood spiral.
 

 But the last few days I feel like I had a bit of a revelation so I wanted to share it people who aren't feeling as good.
 

 I'm 28 now but I've suffered from severe social anxiety since I was around 17. My anxiety was at it's peak when I was younger during school/university where I basically just hid in my room and tried to avoid people like the plague. I remember eating at 2am every day so no one else would be in the kitchen (shared apartment), and literally getting on my hands and knees to pick specks of dirt out of my carpet so I didn't have to go and ask the landlady where the vacuum was kept.
 

 As I got older, it seemed to get better though that may be largely down to not having to interact with half as many people now that I'm out of school. I work in finance now and can struggle with anxiety about meetings and zoom calls but I get to spend a lot of my time doing my own stuff with spreadsheets.
 

 For the last 2 years, though, I have been in my first relationship and now live with my partner. This time has been full of anxiety and particularly a bad case of anhedonia (inability to feel positive emotions).
 

 A few days ago I realised that I spend pretty much all my time thinking about what other people may be thinking. I live in a small place with my partner, so we pretty much sit next to each other at our desks most of the day. I realised that I spend most of my time wondering what he's thinking and feeling, and how he is perceiving me and what I'm doing. Am I bothering him/being too loud? If I do \[X\] will he comment on it? I want to say \[X\] to him but how would he respond?
 

 Later that day I was sitting cradling my cat in my arms. I realised that I was actually sitting in a very uncomfortable position that was hurting my back, but I really didn't want to move at all if it would disturb the cat. And that's when it kind of just clicked for me. I'm willing to put up with unreasonable levels of discomfort just so I don't bother someone else in the tiniest way. And sometimes I can feel a bit resentful towards other people (e.g. my partner) who don't show the same level of consideration towards me. But that's just because *it's literally insane*.
 

 Again, it sounds silly to say but it made me think of how my cats behave. They will come and snuggle with me when they want to, but if I try to show them affection when they don't want it, they will just walk away. And if I try to force it on them, they might give me a little warning bite. And that's how animals are *supposed* to behave - caring for oneself. Setting boundaries with others.
 

 The last few days, I have felt great. I'm sure I'm not just ""cured"", I'm still struggling with anhedonia, but I feel like that the big pit in my stomach has disappeared and I have noticed my thoughts being so much calmer and orderly. I had an argument with my partner last night and I felt quite anxious at the time but afterwards I just let it go. I didn't spend the next two days crippled by anxiety wondering whether he is still mad and if we need to break up over it. I didn't overanalyse every move he made or thing he said to try to reassure myself he still cared about me.
 

 I have been more productive today than I have been in a long time, because I'm just thinking about what I need/want to do. The most noticable difference is that I'm becoming much more aware of how I feel physically. Am I thirsty? Is my posture uncomfortable? Oh, I've been holding my breath for no reason for a while! These are things I've been tuned out of for a long time."
"I got a new job offer that really helps with my schedule since I'd be working from home and I'm still studying, but I'm feeling anxious about actually going through with quitting my current job.
 

 I feel like I might not be good enough for the new job and they might fire me, and I feel like I'm in some sort of a comfort zone where I'm currently working. The thing is I also think the new job would be an improvement moving forward in my field.
 

 How would you (or have you) guys manage(d) this kind of insecurities and anxiety?"
"How do you cope with health anxiety when you've had real dangers and threats?
 I've had awful luck when abroad. I was spiked on holidays in Greece when I was 19. I ended up in hospital with a broken wrist, stitches and a punctured lung. Before that I had never broken a bone in my body nor experienced any issue. It was a horrible experience and I believe it was the start of my PTSD journey.
 The next time I was 20 on erasmus in Austria. I had drank alot of gin the night before and was quite hungover the next day. When vomiting my heart went into alcohol-induced atrial fibrillation and I had to be shocked back into the rhythm. That's when my health anxiety really blew up. Doctors blamed the alcohol and said my heart was fine after all tests. 
 I lived in a constant state of anxiety for about a year after that event. Daily panic attacks, ER visits, depression and fear. All while still being a college student who was on placement at the time in France. I felt that I was cursed and that wherever I travelled to, bad things would happen to me. 
 Eventually after a while, I slowly got over it and went on with my life. I'm 25 now but my health anxiety came back with a massive vengeance last month. Exactly 5 years later, the exact same thing happened to me. I was drinking loads of gin and vomited the next day when my heart went out of rhythm. I have been living in Vietnam for over a year and once again, here I was in a position where I was alone, scared and in a foreign environment. I feel so scared, hopeless and depressed. I hate that I did this to myself. I don't want to live in anxiety again. I hate my life right now."
"My fiancé (f29) and I (m33) got engaged last spring. At the start of Covid we moved in together. We are planning our wedding for May of this year. Last year we got a dog together, and we’re already talking kids. We’re both very in love, and excited for our future. Unfortunately due to growing anxiety over the state of the word, health problems with our pup $$, job issues, and planning and paying for a wedding; her anxiety had been off the charts. 
 She’s been on Zoloft for a couple years now, and had been numb to the world since the start of covid. About three months ago she had a severe panic attack, and was taken off of Zoloft. She started Lexipro and a new job, and the light in her eyes is back. I’m so happy to see her enjoy things again, laugh, and just be back to the woman that I first met. 
 I’m so proud of her, I support her fully, and I wouldn’t change anything about the last 4 years we’ve spent together. 
 The only issue that we have, is that her SSRI is causing her libido to be lower than ever. We had a very active sex life for the first couple years, but now once a month is a victory. I know it’s not her, it’s the medicine. We have had conversations about it, for a while I thought she was no longer attracted to me, but she assured me this isn’t the reason. 
 I’ve read that Wellbutrin may help, but I hate to bring it up. She feels guilty about her libido, and me bringing it up makes her sad.
 Do we just wait it out and hope for the best?
 Is there anything I can do to help make the situation better?
 Is there a appropriate way to bring this up, or should I shut up and support her?
 Am I justified in being nervous that our sex life could be over?
 I love her so much, there is no one I want to hold in my arms more than her, and it makes us both sad what we can’t."
"I’ve been working as a cashier for several months now and I have a hard time figuring out this male co-worker. He is well liked and some will describe him as shy, however he is one of the supervisors and deals with customers all day and does very well. Throughput my time working with him we barely spoken a few words but he will talk if you initiate the conversation and is mostly friendly. I have social anxiety so no more than a hi is said (on rare occasions). It would help to mention that I am attracted to him and it’s frustrating. The main way we seem to communicate is through eye contact. Sometimes he will look at me and smile but other days if I walk past him, he will avoid eye contact and look at the ground. I will admit I do the same sometimes. The eye contact is so intense sometimes and I freak out. I barely see this co-worker (sometimes a week or more) so I haven’t gotten used to him. How do I get over my fear of him? This seems like a silly post but I’m tired of the fear ruining potential friendships/relationships."
"This is going to be a bit long but bare with me. I've recently been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety and ADHD Inattentive, and I've probably had these conditions since I was 9. My mom was very toxic and very emotionally detached and would often tell me that I was a very annoying person, and I'm fortunate to be pretty because I looks would attract a nice man to be my husband. But my personality was quirky and annoying and I'd need to change who I am to keep said husband or he'd leave.
 

 My ex fiance proposed to me, and my parents went straight to jokes about ""good luck with that one,"" ""once I hand her off, no refunds and no take backs,"" ""are you sure you want this one?,"" it hurt me, and now my current partner, (M33), showed me (F28) some cute couples tattoos. I've been with him for 3years in May this year, and we've hit a lot of snags in our relationship due to me picking up toxic things my mom used to do and didn't realize I was doing. I'm on the road to fixing those now, but I still need work. He and I aren't really tattoo people, and I'd almost do it, if I wasn't afraid of pain or afraid of something happening that would cause us to separate. I don't want to be left with a permanent, constant reminder that nobody will love me forever. 
 

 Even my own family made a point of not wanting me in their lives after I went no contact. So now I know blood relation in this world doesn't matter either.
 

 I'm sorry, I'm having a tough time loving myself this week."
"Hello I’m hoping someone can help me out please, I am 25 years old&amp; I suffer really bad with health anxiety in 2019 I started suffering with muscle twitches swallowing difficulty muscle aches and other things, I was referred to a neurologist which I saw January 2020 he ruled out ALS/MND and any neurological illnesses I felt reassured I left and I was fine up until October 2021 I feel like I’m slurring my words but others around me like my partner friends work colleagues and others have told me I am not slurring my words but to ease my mind my GP re referred me back to my neurologist to rule ALS/MND out again because the fear of that disease runs rampant in my brain, November 4th 2021 the referral was put through to the neurologist and about 2 weeks later I received a letter to which he said this “You have referred this gentleman back to me. You said you did not have the previous letter from
 When I assessed him in January 2020 and I enclose this now
 He requests another specialist
 review to ease his mind after experiencing transient slurring of speech.
 An isolated fleeting episode of specch disturbance in no way suggests MND or any other serious neurological illness.”
 

 I called my neurologist centre up and they said he discharged me and doesn’t want to see me I keep panicking and thinking I have ALS/MND. 
 

 I have 2 young children and all I keep doing is worrying and getting very emotional thinking it’s ALS/MND I am so scared. 
 

 I hope someone can offer me some advice thank you in advance."
"So my health anxiety runs the gamut, but my main fear is the big C, especially when it comes to digestion. I have IBS and anxiety, so I struggle with digestive symptoms anyway. 
 

 Lately, though, it’s as if my greatest fear is being “confirmed” through random coincidences when the disease is mentioned. Like, I turn on the TV and it’s a topic of conversation on a talk show, or a celebrity passes of a similar disease, or it becomes a main storyline in a book I’m reading. It seems like the universe is trying to tell me that I’m secretly suffering from this disease even though my chances of actually having it are pretty rare. 
 

 I’m pretty young (25f) and don’t drink, smoke, do drugs, etc. I’m not overweight and I pay attention to any changes in my body. It just sucks that even though I logically know the chances of me having C are low, I still feel debilitating anxiety about it. It’s hard not to feel like the universe is trying to send me a warning. 
 

 Does anyone else struggle to balance logic with anxiety? Do you think the universe is really trying to tell me something?Of all people, I know you all will understand"
"I'm 27 years old and I've had a lot of part time jobs that ended up overwhelming me and so I'd quit. I haven't worked since the pandemic started and took that time to finish my bachelor's degree (honestly I still feel like I just turned 25 and approaching 30 is ??). 
 

 It's really hard for me to commit to jobs because of how disabling anxiety (and social anxiety) has been for me. I also have an autoimmune disease I was diagnosed with at 17 that took me up until now to get under control with the right medication. My parents have supported me and I have worked really hard on my physical and mental health. I graduated college at the end of 2020, things felt like they were turning around until my fiance passed 9 months ago and he was my everything, so life just really sucks and I'm so afraid of everything again. That's my major issue right now, I want to hide away but also don't.
 

 I'm in therapy and finally on medication that actually helps for the first time with my anxiety and sleep. I'm starting a job monday at a preschool and starting grad school for teaching this semester. It's a good preschool and I already know someone who works there, it's only 3 hours a day. I'm only taking a few classes. I'm just terrified I won't be able to handle it and I'll quit. I really don't want that to happen. Everything feels so fragile and I don't know a life where I don't quit, but I know I need to grow up. I don't want to be that person anymore."
"Hello. I’m (28F) just looking to see if there’s people having similar physical reactions to their anxiety so I feel less alone and anxious about it. My anxiety ever since the pandemic started has been very intense. I was coping using Marijuana at least once a day, as I’d been a regular smoker prior to the pandemic. I quit almost 4 weeks ago after having a scary reaction to the “Cymbalta” my doctor tried to prescribe me. Worst decision of my life to try and take it, only lasted 2 days before I experienced what I believe to have been a Serotonin Syndrome attack. Anyways, it’s been my first few weeks sober during the pandemic and my anxiety after all these recent events (I was in very bad shape to have been willing to try Cymbalta in the first place) has started causing physical symptoms I’m not used to. 
 

 I’m experiencing numbness in my face, mouth, and neck at least once a day. The back of my neck will feel so weak, like it can’t hold up my head. My throat will feel funny and tight. Sometimes I can’t eat because it feels like I’m choking. A lot of uncomfortable new sensations. I messaged my primary doctor and they think it’s anxiety, as does Google, and that I should just take my Ativan. Taking the prescribed amount (1 pill) doesn’t appear to ever do anything. Taking 2 pills does seem to significantly help. I can’t be taking Ativan excessively tho, as I don’t want to build a dependency on it. 
 

 Has anybody felt similar? I constantly have to lay down because my neck and head feel so bizarre and it just causes me further anxiety. I live alone, which doesn’t help. I thought I was having a good relaxing Saturday until the neck sensations started up again. It’s like my body must just be in such a constant state of stress that I don’t even notice it…"
"So I'm in the final frontier I think with my anxiety journey. I've dealt with terrible physical sensations and dizziness. I've worked to reduce and eliminate things like muscle weakness and over-sensation of my arms and legs. None of these things cause me the all day terror and dread they used to. They may still be problematic here and there but I'm confident they'll continue to go away until they're gone. 
 

 I'm basically left with twitches and hypnotic jerks, which I'm confident will improve with my new dedication to the gym, sleep fear (and insomnia) and heart palpitations. 
 

 What did you do for insomnia/sleep fear and the palpitations? My insomnia is caused by stress about not getting proper sleep which I haven't been getting for a few weeks now. Ironically I was sleeping much better when my daytime anxiety was higher but that is perhaps because I was more tense and exhausted. I'm hoping gym time will help with these as well but any other tips are greatly appreciated!"
"Just as the title says, my fiance was having shortness of breath and a fever, so we took him to the hospital just to be safe. They did a COVID test and a flu test. It came back positive for COVID. I thought for sure he'd have the flu because he had the exact symptoms I had a few weeks back. I got a test then and it came back negative. 
 

 My mind is racing. Is there any way I can avoid getting COVID too? Do I already have it? Did I have it a few weeks ago? We came home from the hospital and he is quarantining in our bedroom, and I'm on the couch. I wiped everything down with Lysol wipes and threw the couch blankets into the washing machine. 
 

 We're both vaccinated x2, so I know that it shouldn't be as bad as it could be, but I am petrified that it's a death sentence. I've taken twice the amount of ativan I normally take for panic attacks and I'm still just completely horrified. Please help ease my mind."
"Hello,
 

 Basically, I got my N at 22, then just never drove again since I had no money and was busy with school. 
 

 Now, I am 27 and it's really about time I began driving again. I have a nice job, so I plan on getting a new car. I'm going to buy one with my brother, who is extremely car savvy. I need to buy one to help my dad out who broke his leg last week and to save much needed time getting to work during the day. I asked my brother to come to the car lots with me next week, so no more backing out or talking myself out of it time and time again. 
 

 I think I can drive alright (well, I'm not a good parker at all but I'm ok with road stuff). What are some tips when buying a new car? And what are some tips to ease driving anxiety again? 
 

 I was planning on driving more at night in my home town when the roads are empty to start and in the empty parking lots for a few days. Anything else?"
"25M Have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression in 2017, started Paroxetine 20MG that worked pretty well up until this year. Have been an everyday cannabis smoker for about 6 years which plays a big part into my story. This entire year I will have months where I am crippled with anxiety and depression (don't eat, cant sleep, don't go out, cry all day) so I started really combatting my mental health. I started a counselor as well as CBT about 5 weeks ago. I am now on 30mg Paroxetine with 150mg Wellbutrin and just finished 5 weeks since the start. The last few weeks have been going okay with some anxiousness here and there. 
 

 I work from home and mornings are very hard for me. I wake up and instantly worry about how many hours are in the day; am I going to be depressed all day? Will I have an anxiety attack? So many questions run through my head. I try to not smoke as soon as I wake up because I think its important for my body to feel normal emotions. This morning I woke up and was anxious as usual, I signed on to work as I always do, and I started to sift through reddit as well. I had my first anxiety attack in about 3-4 weeks. I started sweating, couldn't breath, started gagging and went to the bathroom. After my attack I am extremely tired and just want to take a nap. This causes more anxiety because yes I work from home but I am the only one in the company allowed too. I feel bad to take a nap during the work day even though I get all my work done and have never had any issues with not answering phone calls or emails. I am super hard on my self which causes a lot of my anxiety. 
 

 Does anyone have any input on how to wake up easier without so much overthinking? Also does anyone that suffers from anxiety or depression also work from home? Do you overthink about how hard you are working or how much work you got done?"
"I've been noticing a good portion of the times I feel anxious, nervous, jittery, shakey, fuzzy headed, (and other anxiety symptoms), that my spo2 is around 100% rather than it's usual 96 to 97. Is this a way I can confirm it's anxiety and the symptoms are all related to overbreathing? I hear mixed opinions on whether spo2 is affected by anxiety, but ive been told by a few doctors all my symptoms are anxiery related even though I don't feel like I am that stressed out. I've had clean ekgs, echos, Holters, etc, and this seems like a connection. What do you all think or what have you all experienced with this relationship between anxiety and raised spo2.
 

 Thanks :)"
"I developed a sore throat today and nothing more. But when I am just about to fall asleep, I wake up thinking I am choking and can’t swallow. This only happens when I get a sore throat being sick usually and idk if it’s because my subconscious mind finds it uncomfortable?? It sounds weird but I just want to be able to sleep :/"

I’m so scared I have Covid 😭 and now I can’t tell if I am having a panic attack with shortness of breath or if it’s from Covid 😭 I’m getting test this morning. Can someone please help my worries?
I have things coming up this weekend and I need to drive to them. I’m worried i will crash or end up in an accident and this prevents me from wanting to drive but I have no choice. Performance anxiety is getting to me
"I've had driving anxiety since before I started driving at 16. I'm 29 now. The panic attacks lessened for a while, though I still had a lot of anxiety, and I was able to get my license and buy a car. Its gotten worse to the point I feel like I'm going to faint while driving, and I go blind when I actually do faint so its very stressful. It's holding me back from a lot of things and interfering with my life and I feel like its one thing I'll never fully get over. I can push myself to do it, and I have been, but the anxiety is awful and puts me in an awful mood. I've tried techniques from my therapist like putting the music down and having an air freshener with a relaxing scent but it doesn't help much. 
 

 Has anyone gotten over it or know of any other tips to help lessen the anxiety?"
I (25F) started a new job before Christmas and I've been struggling with my anxiety while learning and being trained. This job is a great opportunity and I want to do well. Am I putting too much pressure on myself because of my anxiety is getting the better of me? I feel like I'm not learning everything I should be and I'm feeling overwhelmed which is a struggle in my brain. One hand I know I'm new and should allow myself to take it one step at a time but the other hand is pushing me to know everything right now and feel like I'm letting the people who are training me down. I came into this job not knowing anything about it. Just over here swimming in being anxious
Hi everyone 26f I’ve had serve insomnia since I was 13 and finally got prescribed trazodone for the first time. They gave me 50mg but I’m a bit anxious so I’m trying just half of a pill. Not sure if it’s my anxiety but I definitely feeling something not sleepy but someone going on any advice or experiment ?
"And it was so dehumanizing. I'm 25 years old and I had a panic attack because I HATE needles. I don't avoid things like vaccinations-- I trust my nurses to do a good job, and I can look away and pinch myself to distract from the feeling. I usually get a little dizzy from the anxiety but not much else. 
 

 Well, I just started a med that I have to inject at home (think similar to insulin) and so I went to the doctor so they could show me how to do it myself. The nurse was showing me how to do it and she jabbed the practice pen so forcefully in her example. I asked her, ""do I need to jam it that forcefully into my leg?"" She said, ""well, it's a thick needle so yeah."" 
 

 I was already feeling shaky and I legit started crying in front of her. I have NO reason to be afraid of needles, NO prior trauma...but for some reason my body was like...you know what, let's flip out about this usually minor phobia today. 
 

 When I finally worked up the courage to do it, I didn't stab hard enough and sort of missed and the needle didn't completely penetrate my skin. My hands were shaking and I was still mid panic attack. Unfortunately, the nurse seemed like she was kind of reverting to her pediatric training, saying things like ""wow, you're so brave"" and ""look at you, you did it even though you were scared!"" It felt so infantilizing and insulting. Like, I'm a grown ass person having a panic attack in the doctor's office, please just give me a little space to chill myself out, and if anything, ask me if I need water or a tissue or something.
 

 The best part about this whole interaction is that as I was leaving, my doc, not my nurse, said congratulations as I was walking out the door. He said that because I just bought a gorgeous 4 bed/4 bath house and was planning on moving soon (he's been my doctor a long time and tends to ask me about my life, how I'm doing etc). The nurse, who hasn't heard the context about the house, said ""Yes, congratulations! She was so brave today!"" So rough haha.
 

 So yeah, I bought a house this week and in the same week, also cried because I didn't want to give myself a shot. 
 

 The duality of man."

"My mind has been on quite the adventure for the past few months. For a little background on my situation. Due to severe childhood trauma, I've had social anxiety for most of my life which has made it difficult for me to make friends and build relationships. I'm 27 years old and live across the country away from close family members. I'm a loner with no close friends nearby who spends most of his days just working, eating, and sleeping. I don't have any real hobbies and I can't find motivation to do anything else or find new hobbies. I'm too comfortable in doing nothing. Essentially, my life consists of doing just the bare minimum to survive. I should also note that due to my social anxiety, I have never really went out to date and meet women. As such I'm a dateless kissless 27 year old virgin.
 

 For the past few months, after a severe mental breakdown, my life has been hell. Every single day I go through episodes of stress and anxiety. I'm constantly stressing out over my life and social failures. These are thoughts I deal with daily.
 

 -What am I like this? What is wrong with me? Why I did I have to grow up like this? Why didn't I try to resolve my issues earlier? Why didn't I try to be more social when I was younger? Man I'm such a fucking pathetic loser. Nobody likes or cares about me. What is the purpose of my life?
 

 My mind is racing 24/7 with these stressful thoughts I can't control it and I don't how to stop. These are general thoughts I have. The thoughts about my dating life are even worse.
 

 -Why didn't you take more steps to talk to girls? Why don't you approach women? Why didn't you take steps to have a dating life? You'll never have a love life. You'll never find anyone. Nobody will ever date you. Nobody will ever find you attractive. You'll never have sex and will be a virgin forever. You're just a fucking loser, what would anyone want to be with you?
 

 Along with these stressful thoughts that have taken over mind, I've had this urge to have sex that I have never had before. I'm fantasizing daily about being with a woman and spending time with her. I'm having fantasies about how good my life would be if I had someone with me right now. These fantasies along with the thoughts about my dating life failures have put me in a very stressed out and depressive state.
 

 Why is this happening to me all of a sudden? To take steps towards fixing my social anxiety, I started going to meetup events. They've helped a little, but I still have so issues so I know my social anxiety isn't the only problem here. Can a therapist can help out with my issues? I'm kind of embarrassed about my situation."
"I’m a 27F and I’m really struggling with keeping a job.
 

 I’m a very hard worker and did very well in school and in university but once I got into the work place it’s like I have performance anxiety. 
 

 Tasks seem insurmountable and certain things that shouldn’t take too long end up being delayed. It’s not because I’m not working or trying I just can’t seem to finish things.
 

 I realise it relates to me feeling like my work won’t be good enough and my superiors won’t be impressed. Back in school it seemed because I was the only one I needed to impress it was as if I could function better.
 

 I feel like I’ve lost the ability to be creative and achieve things because I’m just crippled with self doubt and anxiety. 
 

 

 Last year I was working practically every night and most weekends and felt like I still couldn’t keep up with my job and do it well.
 

 My boss is a real asshole (other colleagues agree) but he’s said some very hurtful things to me about me delaying projects and thinking I have a defeated attitude. He’s annoyed that I haven’t mastered animation since I joined the video production company in April 2021. Despite my efforts I know I’m not where I should be although I recognise after effects is seriously difficult to learn and takes a long time. Btw I was hired as an editor and camera assistant with the idea that I’d become the animation person over time.
 

 Time I would have like to have spent learning more I was just trying to keep up with normal work.
 

 I just feel like I’ve become incapable of focusing and doing anything.
 

 Ive decided to resign but this has become a pattern in my life where I’m questioning am I ever going to be able to hold down a job and actually progress? I don’t want to live with my parents forever.
 

 It’s really tough seeing all your peers progress, buy a house and things and I still live at home and can’t make enough to move out.
 

 I studied journalism and worked as journalist before changing careers into video production and this was my first job in this field. I left journalism because having to get answers from people and deal with some level of conflict wasn’t good for me although I liked the story telling aspect. 
 

 It’s like the only tasks I can do are the super simple things that require little mental effort. But when it comes to anything where I need to apply my mind and create, my brain just shuts off and I have brain fog.
 

 People I talk to in the industry (or just from online reading) all seem to have just learnt things as they went and just made a plan when they didn’t know how to do things. I feel like am I too stupid to just learn as I go and take intiative etc? 
 

 Do I need to be spoon fed? I don’t want to be that person.
 

 Has anyone else experienced something like this and overcome it? Is it common? Any insight or tips welcome. I’m so worried that life’s gonna pass me by and I’m going nowhere."
"At the start of lockdown I thought it was great I'd be able to smoke weed, take acid, play video games and ride it out. It felt like my introversion was almost training me for it, after a few months though the loneliness crept in and I moved in with a friend and her mum which Im eternally grateful for, honestly I don't think I would of been able to make it two years without them. Over the next 2 years or so things were awesome I really enjoyed it here, I got an opportunity to start my own business properly working out of their garage. Over this last winter though I've really spiraled, i'm 28 and haven't been with anyone since I was 20, and I used COVID as an excuse at first to get out of social situations but now it's bitten back. To explain before lockdown I used to use drugs to numb the anxiety to a point where I could deal with groups and using the drugs as a crutch I started using for smaller and smaller interactions with worked great at the time but now that I'm clean and had 2 years of fairly minimal contact I feel so overwhelmed with everything. I've been a shit friend and blown most of them at any opportunity, my business is failing and I just wish I could tell people I need help but even simple things like saying I don't like a certain film is difficult for me let alone sticking my neck out and telling someone that I'm hurting. I've tried emailing Samaritans but it wasn't much help, I just want to know that everythings gonna be ok and I'm not a waste of space. I wish I was anyone but me most of the time and I just want to like who I see in the mirror."
"Hi friends! 
 

 Thank you in advance, I really appreciate your input!
 

 I (26M) think I’ve been experiencing some pretty bad anxiety for 2-3 months now but it only seems to be manifesting physically. I sometimes feel a heavy weight on my chest or a ball of nerves in my abdomen. Is this what anxiety feels like?
 

 I’m really puzzled because nothing in particular comes to mind to what could be causing it. The only big change that’s happened was getting into a relationship. 5 months ago I got into my first ever relationship and at first I thought that was the cause. My anxiety made me question everything about my relationship. But once the clouds part in my brain I feel the deepest love for my partner. So I don’t think my relationship, which is very healthy, is the cause. More so I think my anxiety is latching onto the uncertainty that comes with a relationship, especially my first one. 
 

 So my question is, is this normal? Can you feel anxious over nothing? Shouldn’t there be a source? I’d really appreciate hearing from you guys about this. Every time I try to introspect I feel like I just find something else unrelated to be anxious about. And now that I’ve realized this and stopped my brain from doing it, I feel physically anxious but nothing comes to mind. Like I’m watching my Netflix show with an elevated heart rate for no reason lol
 

 It’s mentally and physically exhausting to be in a constant state of fight or flight all the time. I feel like my anxiety is a weighted blanket over my emotions and libido, weighing everything down and preventing anything from getting out. I’m currently seeing a therapist and we’re gonna start CBT. I’m also very open with my partner about my anxiety and she’s been incredibly supportive. I’m also trying to get an appointment with my doctor to start medication. If anyone has been in my shoes before, has medication helped?
 

 Thank you!!!!!
 

 Edit: I randomly started crying my eyes out and I don’t know why."
"Looking for some gym routines that worked for others. I go to planet fitness so nothing too crazy.
 

 My current routine is:
 

 Run 1 mile, under 8 minutes. 
 30 minutes on the Arc Trainer. 
 Squat Machine, 12 reps high weight. 
 Pecs and back/shoulders on the rowing machine and others. 
 Random other leg extensions or arm items depending on the day. 
 

 I don't have cardiophobia. I am very tired as I've been struggling with insomnia. I've used the treadmill and Arc Trainer to overcome some of my physical symptoms. The weight lifting to break my muscle tension (doing wonders) and limit my dizziness and unsteadiness (also pretty much gone). 
 

 Looking to see if anyone has suggestions for things they have added or done that helped their anxiety in any way. I am skipping my usual crunches and push ups as part of my original anxiety was that I had somehow messed my neck up bad doing those too much and that was the cause for some of my physical symptoms."
"Since November I have had the worst time health anxiety wise. I am 28 years old and whilst I had some health issues as a baby, I’ve really never had a reason to completely spiral. I’ve had some eye issues in the past that pushed me to a dark place but because I’m so used to going to opthamalogists, I’m a little more desensitized to the doctors offices for that kind of thing. I’ve worn glasses since I was a toddler.
 

 But the cardiologist, all that stuff is so new to me and so frightening. I mean your heart is your ticker. It’s one of the most important organs you have. So I’ll tell you my story.
 

 I have scoliosis and had a really really bad muscle spasm. I thought it was a pinched nerve in my right shoulder blade because I felt numb and tingly down my arm and just a variety of sensations.
 

 I went to urgent care and they ordered an ekg right away without giving me any clarity as to why, I was shaking and crying in full panic. So no surprise my HR was 111. But the ekg said some weird things and the doc said I should go to a cardiologist. This started a frenzy for me. I was so concerned. Stuff like this doesn’t happen to me.
 

 So I decided to be a grown up since nobody makes these appointments for me anymore and I went to the cardiologist. Another abnormal ekg but this time my HR was 95 and it said different things up top. The doc checked my vitals, asked questions and said you are perfectly healthy. He ordered an echo and stress test for me.
 

 I went to the echo, the sonographer took a look at me and said “you’re gonna be okay” said my heart looked good and sent me on my way.
 

 Then I got a call while I was riding a peloton that sent my heart rate to new levels and freaked me out. “Your heart is pumping normal, chambers and valves look normal but the doctor wants you to do a bubble study to see if you have a birth defect.”
 

 I felt like I couldn’t breathe, I started crying so hard, told her how badly I had health anxiety and that I don’t know what to do. She walked me through, got me set up for the study and told me not to worry.
 

 I go to the bubble study, cried while they were placing the IV, cried while the nurse prepped me. And then I tried to meditate when the doc came in. 
 

 “You have an interatrial aneurysm. But 30% of the population has some sort of defect in this part of the heart. You’ll have to tell the doctors if and when you get pregnant but we wouldn’t do anything about this sort of thing unless you began to get strokes.”
 

 I tried to ask as many questions as I can. He put his hand on me and said “live your life. Nobody can 100% predict the future but you are okay.”
 

 Because of the build up to this test and the fact it still isn’t over because I still have a stress test, I have been clenching my jaw so tightly that my shoulder neck and head have had nonstop headaches and tension. It has been unbearable. I have felt like I’m losing my mind. I confused my black glasses frame with being a black floater and broke down in the middle of target thinking this must be a stroke.
 

 And then I discovered my jaw and what I had been doing and the tension. All of the tension. It’s like I didn’t even realize that I was doing this to myself. I mean I’ve had this birth defect my whole life, why on earth would I get a stroke in the middle of target just because I now know about it. What would be the chances?
 

 So my point with sharing all of this is fight back.
 

 Your health anxiety won’t stop a bad diagnosis from coming if it will come one day. What is… is. And that’s so hard to accept, I’m not saying it’s easy. But you think you’re preparing yourself but you’re not, you’re just suffering.
 

 But meditate, listen to calming playlists, take nature walks, journal, write poetry, buy a weighted blanket, set aside time to practice breathing. Aromatherapy. Massages.
 

 Whatever tools you have at your disposal, use them. Make an action plan to use them. Schedule it out, make it a habit. Don’t let it win.
 

 Because life is our mini infinity and everyone on here deserves a quality of life."
"Hey everyone, so lately I feel like I have been very worried about my mom and her memory and mind. However, I don’t know if I am being paranoid and obsessive at this point. For example, yesterday she wanted to show me a picture of my grandpa but couldn’t remember the word for face masks because she wanted to show me how thin his face mask was in the picture. It wasn’t until she saw the picture she remembered the word mask. Then later on that same day we were talking about my cousin and she wanted to say your cousin with a baby, but she ended up saying pregnant cousin. She immediately corrected herself. Today again she started coughing and I asked if she was okay and she said “yeah the air went down the wrong tube” but she meant to say saliva. And again she immediately corrected herself. I don’t know if that is cause for worry since it barely started yesterday. Anytime she forgets something I feel a pang of panic and now I feel like I am obsessing over her mix up of words. Is this a cause to worry? Please let me know."
Absolutely fine during the day but when it comes to bed time you get all these different symptoms and can’t sleep for hours and tell yourself you will go to the doctors and get checked out but never do
"Hi all, so I kind of just need to vent and have no friends other than family or my boyfriend so I came here.
 

 I (26F) have had anxiety since I was little, I had an abusive bio-dad who has been out of my life since I was 8 but he left me pretty messed up.
 

 Last year I met my boyfriend and we clicked instantly and everything has just been so easy with him, I could genuinely see myself spending forever with him. But I am scared that my brain which overthinks everything and anything will ruin it, if not now then down the road.
 

 He is quite good, if I am having an anxious thought I can tell him and he will talk it through with me till I am okay again.
 

 Now I normally spend Friday-Monday at his house and then see him mid week… except he has Monday off works and asked if I could go home on the Sunday night so he can have a lie in (he would have to get up to let me out as I don’t have a key).
 

 Now whilst I understand his request to be reasonable it made me so sad and I kept it together but started crying as soon as I was alone and thinking ‘maybe he doesn’t like sleeping with me anymore’ ‘maybe he’s bored of me’ ‘what if he doesn’t feel the same’ - I just feel so sad and panicked because I am scared something is wrong even though there probably isn’t 
 

 Anyhow thanks for the space to vent"
"I have social anxiety, regular anxiety, and a bunch of other issues. I want to go to therapy but I'm so embarrassed to bring up the issue that causes me the most anxiety. 
 

 I've had social anxiety for most of my life which makes it difficult for me to meet people and make friends. This encompasses everything down to my dating life. Because of childhood trauma and my social anxiety, I've never went out and tried dating so as a result I'm a 27 going 28 year old dateless kissless virgin. My lack of dating life and being a virgin has me so embarrassed that I'm hesitant to go to therapy for it. I'm constantly stressed out and regularly go through episodes of anxiety over it. Will I ever find anyone? How the hell does one go out and date? Am I bound to be forever alone? Will I ever learn to date? Am I going to die a virgin?
 

 These thoughts are so intrusive and effect my daily life that I'm suffering daily. Is this a problem I can bring up to a therapist?"
"Been on zoloft for 11 years or more. Currently with quetiapine and gabapentin prn.
 

 Im tired of having all these nasty side effects(sex ,WEIGHT GAIN, etc)
 

 Ive tried numerous ssris and also tried to come off with psych help but always go back to zoloft cause i feel even worse off it. 
 

  One pshyciatrist wanted to put me on xanax only without any other treatment. Only the benzo. She wanted me off zoloft . I of coarse said no as ive seen reviews that benzodiazepines are not for long term.

"I've been going to meetup events to help with my social anxiety. Overall they have been good and I've been having a good time. But every once in a while when I want to talk I keep finding myself in this situation and it's really kills me inside. 
 

 Every once in a while when I'm talking with a group, I want to conversate and control the conversation and talk along but someone else jumps in the chat and overtakes me and I end up losing the conversation. I end up losing the conversation and when I try to jump back in, I fail. I mention one thing and no one pays much attention to what I say and the conversation go back to someone else.

 She’s always been the type that can be alone and needs time to herself which in return I’m the same way and that’s never been an issue for us. But recently before Christmas she’s been starting to shut me out more and more and I can’t grasp why…. We’ve barely talked that much and when I would ask what was wrong or if she wanted to talk about what was going on she would always tell me no. 
 

 Last weekend she totally shut me out and wouldn’t respond to me at all. I let a day go by and told her how I was feeling and that I was lost to why she shut me out and I felt like she wasn’t into me or wanted to do anything with me. We haven’t had sex or much less cuddled in two months. All of this just came out of nowhere. I FaceTimed her and asked her what the hell was going on because I’m in the dark. She immediately broke down and started crying and she said on top of all the stress she’s going through with work that she feels like she’s letting me down and not giving me the needs I deserve and was almost to the point of us wanting to split up because she didn’t want to keep hurting me because it was hurting her even more. 
 

 After talking about it and assuring her that I was here for her and that I just needed to understand what was going on. I love the girl and wouldn’t want something like this to end what we have. (We’ve been knowing each other for 5 years and we have both chased each other throughout that time and finally decided to give it go because it was finally right). Anyways after talking she told me she just needed to be alone and assured me it was nothing about me that was the problem and that she loved me very much and just needed me to give her space. 
 

 She proceeded to spend the next two days in bed upset and still crying but it wasn’t about hurting me just the overall anxiety still. This past Wednesday she brought me to my surgery and insisted that I stayed with her so she could help take care of me. I originally declined because I didn’t want add to the pile of stress that she already had but she insisted. 
 

 After my surgery we went to her house and both took a long nap and we woke up, went to go grab some food, laughed and talked and then watched a movie. It was great. she handled some things around the house the next day and then went to see one of her friends that evening and then came home and bathed and everything. When she laid down I asked her to cuddle, granted this was the first time we would in quite some time. She said sure. Usually when we would cuddle she would bury her body into mine and you could feel the love, but this time it felt forced and she barely laid her head on my chest while the rest of her was away from me. 
 

 The next day she went to work and later I asked her if she wanted to go eat some steaks with friends and she stated that she had made plans with her friend that just went though a crisis with her relationship and wanted to go make her feel better and let her vent. Granted the whole reason I’m there was for her to help me and spend time with her. I told her that was fine and said I would bring her a steak back and she said don’t worry about coming all the way back for that and that she would be getting home a little late and would go straight to sleep for work in the morning so basically that was my invitation to go home. 
 

 We didn’t talk at all today while she was working and she finally texted letting me know she was home and asked How I was feeling and that she was stressed out and her anxiety was bugging her again and she would be falling asleep soon. I sent her a message telling her to take everything one thing at a time and that if she needed me to talk or vent call Me and I assured her that I was here for and love her. 
 

 Now some may think she is cheating but I know for sure she isn’t. Honestly the most loyal Girl I’ve Been with. She starts a turnaround soon that will be nights for a month straight and I’ll be having my second surgery which will also have me bed ridden for a month so we will have no time for each other and barely time to talk. I would hate to go into that with how everything is right now but more than likely it will be like this. 
 

 I know this is a lot to read but I’m hoping this reaches some who could offer some advice on how I could make this easier for both of us or should I let her continue to shut me out and let her figure it out and fix it at her pase even though it’s hurting and pushing me away. The last thing I want is to lose her. But if that what needs to be done so she can get better then I need to. Thanks"
"I've dealt with anxiety my whole life and other different disorders that all have been intensified by the anxiety.
 

 My life has been summed by my different struggles which has resulted in it really forming my identity of a broken person. I've dealt with selective mutism, hyperhidrosis, severe vertigo. I was really struggling with my vertigo because it was affecting my work, social life and everyday activities so I had to go back home to live with my parents. 26M here.
 

 And then when I thought it couldn't get any worse, I've just been hit by a terrible bout of insomnia that has resulted in a lot of sleepless nights the past few weeks. Like I was already in deep pain before ANOTHER issue just came on that's affected me deeply.
 

 I'm now scared to death that I have to live with this terrible sleeping issue for the rest of my life and it's going to be similar to the other problems in my past where it just makes things miserable.
 

 I just feel like I can't catch a break. Really struggling here...
 

 Seeing a therapist rn but everything just feels overwhelming rn. 
 

 I'm just so fucken loss and overwhelmed I don't know what to do, I hate this feeling. If anybody has any encouraging words I'd appreciate it ❤️"
"Im so sorry if this is triggering or isn’t allowed here. I don’t know who else to talk to. Im 26f healthy besides the bad anxiety that has recently turned into HA. its almost like its ocd manifesting in the form of cardiophobia. So i got my heart checked today and the ekg had “subtle abnormalities” the cardiologist assured me multiple times it was nothing i should be concerned about. So we scheduled a stress test and an echocardiogram for almost 1 month out to dig deeper. 
 

 Now how the hell am i to keep myself from spiraling between now and then. Guys im so broken and it feels like im living in a personal hell. Every minute of every day i convince myself death is right behind me. I just… im so sick of this. 
 

 Does any one have any comfort or experience they can offer me in regards to “subtle abnormalities” on an ekg? Please if you can talk me down off this ledge im on :("
"I (27M) am currently dating a wonderful girl (26F) for a few months. She is amazing and thoughtful and literally never had this great of a relationship. 
 

 I tend to find small ""clues"" in relationships and magnify them and come up with a conclusion like ""oh she's going to leave me"" or ""why doesn't she love me"". Now I am starting to see a therapist to start working on this insecurity as I have started to have a few arguments here and there with her for seemingly no reason.
 

 I feel like my happiness on a daily basis is determined by almost how much attention and love she gives me - which sounds like codependency. I'll notice that she didn't text me as much and assume that she must be thinking of breaking it off.
 

 Today I just randomly cried. It wasn't even about her, I just really want to be normal. Most of my friends have found their person and are able to have a healthy relationship. I always tend to end things when the anxiety is too much. I feel like its easier to just be kinda sad alone then to have the anxiety of losing something you love.
 

 With this girl, I really want things to work out because she is unbelievably kind and we are both very compatible and I really do love her.
 

 Any suggestions on how to stop being so anxious about this relationship and maybe sharing some experiences will help me understand how to cope in a healthy way?
 

 Thanks!"
"So I’ve struggled with anxiety for as long as I can remember (25F) but this past year it’s been the worst it’s ever been. 6 months ago I got into a relationship with my now current boyfriend (22M) he’s amazing, kind, caring, always reassures me, I have no reason not to trust him, but I cannot get the idea that he’s just going to cheat on me out of my mind. I know he won’t cheat, but I also know he will eventually, it’s like I have two brains just constantly fighting eachother, my logical side of thinking and my anxious mind. I know I suffer from an anxious attachment, but it really tires me out, I’m a strong woman, I can hold my own usually and I’m not afraid to speak up, however I cower at the idea that he might be unfaithful. And it’s not like it’s just a feeling of anxiety, it’s almost like I -know- he’ll do it eventually. I’ve gone for help, I’m currently on anti depressants and I’m awaiting therapy. Does anyone else go through these feelings or have gone through them? What do I do to just ease my mind, it makes me feel physically ill. :("
"I am going through one of the most toughest years of my life. I will try to keep it short as possible.
 

 I am 29 year old female in a relationship with great family siblings and parents. I am struggling with crippling social anxiety(not sure to even call it that anymore). I am not anxious around people I don’t know or ordering food I can do that with 0 anxiety. I am anxious around the people I love the most. My sister aka best friend and my own boyfriend to the point where if he proposed I don’t know if I could marry him(even though I want to).
 

 A little back info. I never had social anxiety but it developed in high school with strangers then it magically went away. Then came back about the age of 25 but only with people i know. I use alcohol to cope. Whenever I see my boyfriend I have to drink before and during so I try to see him like 2-3 times a week to avoid drinking. I work alone but when I was working with people I was always anxious and they could tell. It was so humiliating. I told my boyfriend a year ago about me being anxious around him and since he has forgotten I told him and is not going away. Every day I wake up is the worse feeling knowing what is to come. I feel misserable and desperate.
 

 I don’t think I can have children like this. How can I get pregnant if I need to drink when I am anxious? I don’t want to do that. But when I get anxious it feels like im going to die. I feel at this point the only solution is to live alone and never marry never have a family or just die. Is killing me that I can’t enjoy my life because of this. Everything is perfect but my brain is my own enemy. 
 

 (I have only been anxious around my boyfriend for 3 years out of the 10 we were together. Eating out with him terrifies me since we have to be face to face I avoid it or drink before we do anything)
 

 I don’t even know why I am posting this. I guess I hope someone can listen and understand am I the only one?"

Hi everyone so my local grocer had frozen meat tortellini the beef inside looked cooked I think but the packaging did not say so so I’m worried I’ll get sick or mad cow disease from eating the pastas while cooking to test them
"I am starting Effexor tomorrow. I've had chronic anxiety and vertigo for too long so my doctor prescribed me it. 
 

 Are there any success stories or general feedback?"
[removed]
(25F) I feel like no one wants to hear about my boring and sad life anyway. I don’t really go out and do anything fun because I just can’t interact normally with people. I wish I were different.
"My best friend has increasing problems with anxiety (sometimes panic attacks) that produces physical cramps in her stomach. She copes with it in the way that she withdraws into herself, distances from everyone and isolates herself until anxiety and cramps pass. And as a result, she begins to be less and less able to function normally in life. So I'm worried about her and I'm wondering how I can help her with that?
 

 First about how she got into this situation. She comes from a small town. Her parents always had very high expectations of her, she always had to be very good at everything they expect of her. And they are somewhat traditional, especially her dad who thinks his daughter should have a certain role in their family when she is at home in addition to being successful in everything. Plus her mom had problems with her mom and she was scared not to become the same as her, which used to create tensions between the three of them. When we met in our first year of Uni she was a very sociable and open person who was curious about everything, always very honest and direct. Although later as we got to know each other better she told me she need time for herself to recharge to be like that. But because of that behaviour, she was often bullied in elementary school and later she had to enrol in another high school where none of these people was. At the end of high school and the beginning of Uni, she was in a nasty relationship for 5 years with a guy who practically abused her emotionally and mentally. Immediately after breaking up with him, she started a three-year long-distance relationship, which was better, but that guy never reciprocated the effort she put into that relationship, so she broke up with him as well. At the faculty where we study often is very stressful and hard, both students and some professors know to have toxic behaviour. They push students to overwork, they are extremely critical, they are competitive (but not in a positive sense) and they know to create a toxic environment in group work. At the same time, she broke up with the first guy she was in the working group of one such professor. So these cramps and anxiety started to appear more and more often. As a result, she failed to enrol three times an academic year.
 

 So, she learned to go through most of the problems on her own. She often likes to spend time alone mostly gardening, doing something creative or walking in nature. Shortly before the first lockdown, she was given the status of a student with special needs due to her anxiety. During the lockdown, while she was home, she went to a psychologist and was given medication to help her with anxiety and her condition improved the first time after a long time. Even after she told her parents about her health problems, they became a little more relaxed and don’t force her as much as before. It looked like she was going to be better, but this semester she came back at Uni and her condition is getting worse than ever. She postpones going to the student psychologist, avoids going to faculty because the very thought of it makes her anxious unless something is really obligatory. Every time she wants to go on exams or go talk to professors in person (that it is not over zoom) she has to take medication because otherwise she starts to feel dizzy and vomit and gets a panic attack.
 

 Luckily, she has two roommates so she is not completely alone in the apartment but she almost always refuses any socializing when I ask her, we do something I know she loves, to keep her from thinking about the negativity of faculty. She once told me that I am the only person other than her family that she talks to every day and that I am her only male friend. So, she was always somewhat distant from everyone, but never before had she distanced herself so much from everything and withdrawn into herself. She is no longer so honest and direct but keeps the things that bother her inside herself. And every time she feels any stress or pressure, she just withdrawals even more into herself. Her theory of why she is like this is that she may have Asperger's Syndrome, and her psychologist at home doesn't want to send her for testing.
 

 In 8 years of our friendship, I have always been there for her in any bad situations (as much as she allows me), I have always been ready to help her and I will always be ready to alleviate her difficult periods. But for the first time in those 8 years of our friendship, her behaviour has now begun to negatively affect me, her behaviour began to create a lot of stress for me. Other friends who see this tell me that her behaviour is toxic and that I should let her go, but I can't let her go through this difficult period alone. Best friends don’t do that and even when I had difficult periods at the beginning of our friendship, she stayed with me.
 

 Please tell me how to alleviate this negative period she is currently having and how to help her open up to me again? Or how to encourage her to go to a student psychologist here at Uni or if we could do some exercises that can help her? Because as it is now, she is just in a vicious circle where she can't do anything because of anxiety, and then her anxiety grows because she can't do anything."
"I've (29M) recently decided that I want to really work on my mental health this year. I have a therapist who I go to when needed but have really wanted to start feeling better and get past my anxiety on a daily basis. 
 

 I currently try to stay as active as I can (run, lift) but I feel as if it's not enough. 
 

 My anxiety is starting to affect my job and the imposter syndrome is starting to creep in. Sometimes I feel like crying but it's as if my body naturally wants to just keep it from happening. I have been more open about my mental health with people I talk to but not sure if that's a good thing to do since I worry about being judged. 
 

 Any help would be appreciated."
"Hey.
 I had a very interesting anxiety attack today.
 I am 25 and I have high-functioning autism.
 I live with my mother and my grandfather.
 I am incapable of living independently.
 Today, a new show on Prime started called As We See It.
 It focuses on a trio of people in their twenties with autism who go through a lot of the same difficulties that I do.
 I watched it in one sitting and I felt like I myself was a character in it, it was that true to life.
 My favorite show is Daredevil but this show was very close to topping it.
 One of the things that make this show so amazing also feels very raw and hits extremely close to home for me.
 I don't want to go into details and risk spoilers.
 What I will say is that the difficulties that one of the main characters face is their relationship with their older brother which, while not entirely the same, has some elements with the relationship that I have with my uncle.
 We're not exactly the best of friends.
 When he was growing up, all he knew about autism was that Rain Man had it.
 He believes that if you don't have it as bad as Rain Man, then you have no excuse to act differently.
 When I come to him with a problem, he is very quick to remind me that he was the one who went out of his way to come over and set up my PS5.
 "" You don't have problems. You have a PS5. Stop acting like an ungrateful drama queen. ""
 I have a meltdown, he threatens to destroy the Wi-Fi router and I feel ashamed of myself.
 I feel like I'm not allowed to feel negative emotions because I'm not paying the rent.
 This show opened up that wound for me again.
 I feel like the best way that I can communicate with him regarding my autism is by showing him this show.
 I felt very uncomfortable about myself when I watched the show, and I felt very anxious but I love it for it, if that makes sense."
"Sometimes, maybe once or twice a month, I will wake up in the middle of the night and be extremely scared. I feel like I'm still slightly asleep and sometimes don't remember it in the morning for a while. 
 

 I'll [26M] wake up, and be extremely scared something is going to happen to me, and I'll rush out of my bedroom, panting and sometimes I'll briefly and quickly yell. Then idk what really happens; I think I just ask myself WTF I'm doing and I go back into my room and go to bed. I have no idea why this happens, but I think when it does happen, it's when I go to bed super late. Although, I usually only go to bed quite late, and I think the last time I went to bed around a reasonable time like 11, it happened. So idrk.
 

 I'm definitely super confused when I have the episode, and as a child if someone woke me up during a nap or something I would be confused for like 5 minutes.
 

 Anyone else? I can't seem to find anything like this on the internet."
"I am 28 (f) and I get crippling anxiety about gyms. Gyms are my unsafe place and I wish it wasn’t I enjoy working out and wish I could without having panic attacks. Back story I’m in recovery for an eating disorder so occasionally I still have moments of feeling like shit about myself. Every time I’ve stepped foot into a gym and I see girls working out all dolled up wearing barely any clothes it puts me in a really dark place of self shame about my body. I wish I can enjoy the gym because I like working out! I don’t have money to go to a nice gym with a more “older” crowd. I also do not live somewhere like an apartment with a gym. I try to do at home work outs, but I hate those too."
"Hello, I'm f 26, always had a fear of drowning jn a water, and had bad exeriences about it when I was houng. So every time I started thinking about chances of drowning I become absolutely anxious. Hence I decided to take swimming classes 2 weeks ago, it started well, but when on the 3rd lessons we went to swim in the deeper part of the pool w my trainer I got so anxious I started panicing and thinking that I'll drown now and die. Before that lesson I learned to swim with hand /brass/ and legs that ehy my trainer decided to continue lessons in the deeper part. Well today was the 4th lesson, and My anxiety has increased since again after feeling a strong fear of dying. Can you help me how to overcome this anxiety? Anyone with this kind of experience? Im so stressed I can't think of anything else. Please help."
"This is going to be a bit of a reflective vent but it will end happily.
 

 I'm 28 and I first suspected I had ADHD when I was 18. I had already been diagnosed with autism and dyspraxia but I came across a teaching resource one of my friends who was a teacher shared. It was meant as a simple screening tool to identify ADHD traits in kids and refer them for further testing. Almost every single trait applied to me. I found a few semi reliable tests and I consistantly scored highly.
 

 I wanted to get tested but I genuinely had no idea how so I found an ADHD support group and asked about how to get assessed. However instead of support, people started telling me that I was faking and just because I didn't pay attention it didn't mean I had ADHD and I'm taking away resources from real people.
 

 I came away feeling hugely invalidated and genuinely upset. I tried to get support over the years but every time I was invalidated. I couldn't even talk about ADHD traits would could have been down to dyspraxia without being called a faker. Eventually the whole topic became triggering and I was scared to bring it up.
 

 At some point I discovered there was an Adult ADHD team so I rang them up and made a referral. I joined a discord server where other people had ADHD and one of them was supportive and sent me links to resources to help me manage my traits. I got the courage to tell them about being accused of faking. However instead of supporting they just said that I shouldn't say I have ADHD if I don't have a diagnosis (even though I never claimed to have ADHD, only that I suspect I have ADHD) and said it's not wrong for people to question my motives even when I was just asking for advice on how to get an assessment.
 

 They upset me so much I was too scared to use the resources and almost cancelled the referral to the ADHD team.
 

 Anyway, over the next few weeks I had a complete mental breakdown and my mental health team diagnosed me with ADHD team. I learned that prior to 2013 it was hard to be diagnosed with both autism and ADHD so that's probably why I wasn't diagnosed and I've finally been prescribed methylphenidate. I took my first dose today. I don't feel any different but I'll give it time and it's only a starting dose.
 

 It's been such a long and tiring journey. I've been judged so much and if people had been less judgemental I could have been helped much sooner and I could have been saved a lot of pain but I'm finally vindicated."
"Hey.
 As I may have mentioned in another post, I an 25, I have high functioning autism and I have never been on a date with anyone.
 I am not independent.
 I have heard of cases where people in the same position as me, have been able get dates, so I'm thinking about online dating.
 My mother and grandfather take care of me so it would kind of need their okay.
 I'm frightened that I'm going to meet someone who I think is great and have them manipulate me.
 There's a lot of false rape allegations and I feel almost paralyzing fear when I picture a woman saying "" If you don't do this, I'll tell everyone you tried to rape me. ""
 This would be the first date of my life and I'd be worried about going to jail because of it."
"For about the past 2 years it feels like everything has been on a downslide. I know I need to take care of my mental health but it feels almost impossible when I keep having the wind knocked out of me by life changing events. I live at home and my mom can’t even get out of bed.. I talk to her a lot but last night it dawned on me that I cannot keep relying on her like this and that I should really probably have a therapist. I can’t even support her right now the way I should because my mental health is so bad. I don’t really have friends either. Always been a loner, my school and work are both online. It gets a lot more difficult when you are an adult. 
 

 I’ve been putting therapy off because I know it’s going to open a can of worms that will drag up a lot of bad feelings; but I suppose that’s better than carrying this pain with me 24/7. 
 

 I haven’t had the best experience with therapy, I went through 5-6 therapists a few years ago because I felt like all they would do is listen without actually helping me work through the difficult feelings. Now I’m in school for psychology. The idea is to be a clinical psychologist. It made me realize that I 1. Probably could have communicated with my therapists better 2. Maybe had bad therapists. 
 

 I think there is some kind of service on my health insurance website that will help me some people and actually make the appointment for me, so I might just take advantage of that. I have a list of people I was supposed to call weeks ago bury I haven’t been able to bring myself to pick up the phone and make the call. I have ADHD and depression as well.. along with a slew of other issues, so it only make things more difficult for me. I’m also working full time. And raising a puppy. I have a lot on my plate. 
 

 The other thing, well I don’t think I can be the best therapist if I don’t have at least one successful experience with my own therapy. The best therapists, from what I understand, are those who have experience on both sides. Makes sense, right?"
"I've been trying to go out more and for the past month and have been going to meetup events every week. They have been helping my anxiety and are giving me an outlet to be more social, but whenever I talk to people I recently realized that I just share the same old stories with everyone I meet.
 

 My stories always have something to do with my childhood, my college and work life, and the very few outings that I have with the only 2 close friends that I have. I'll mention stories about things I do with my friends. But my friends stories are just shit I did with the only 2 people I regularly talk to. Since I never do anything new and exciting, all of my stories when conversating are just the same recycled chats over and over again."
"I’m (f25) planning to quit one of my jobs; I work as a nanny Tuesday - Friday from 7:45 - 4:15. Fridays vary and sometimes last minute they say I don’t have to come in. Sometimes I’m there until 6pm. Sometimes I’m told I don’t have to come in only to have them call and say hey we need you in an hour. I make $7 an hour watching a toddler; I’ve been with this family since toddler was 8 months old. I tried quitting 3 months ago and got talked into staying with Monday’s off and alternating Fridays off, plus I was making $5 an hour before and it went up to $7. I got a second job and now work 56 hours a week with no days off. I live in California. I feel all of this is important because I feel it shows how little value I’m putting on myself and my time. 
 

 I love this toddler and I want to stay which just makes me more anxious to quit. I’m a people pleaser and I hate people being upset with me but I’m so tired and I have no time for my own family (no kids but I still have family) or even for myself. I tried calling to give my boss a heads up that I want to talk tomorrow evening, I’m going to give them 3 weeks instead of 2. But she didn’t answer and now I’m freaking out and hyperventilating and just can’t calm down. My heart feels like it’s going to rip from my chest and my hands are shaking. I’m not sure what I want by posting this but writing things out usually helps me .
 

 UPDATE: I told her this morning that I wanted to talk with her and her husband tonight, she asked if I wanted to start the conversation now since she thinks her older son has basketball tonight. I basically told her I'm exhausted working 7 days a week and need to put in my three week notice. That it's becoming increasingly difficult to find a way here in the morning due to grandpas health and my other relatives schedules changing. That I'm finding myself calling everyone when someone last minute can't bring me or taking an Uber Lyft or even a taxi. She said ok and for me to talk to her husband when he gets home today. Last time she basically said ok only to text me not to come in the next day an hour later. Then she call me a few hours later upset and said if I can come in so the three of us could talk in person. So I’m kind of unsure how she’s going to be reacting later today or if I’m going to come in at all anymore, although I said I’m giving 3 weeks notice. I was so nervous I was shaking and had to give myself a pep talk mentally. It took 10 minutes before I could start off talking when I got here. Thank you everyone for your support! I still have to talk to her husband tonight but having it out there makes me feel so much better already."
"The anxiety I deal with is exclusively focused on acute health concerns. Mentally, I am very happy, excited, and am immensely grateful for the life I live. However, in the throes of anxiety, I am caught in an awful cycle of thinking the chest tightness I always experience is putting me minutes away from a heart attack or pulmonary embolism. To know that I am completely healthy and not at all anxious about work, or social life, or really anything in general except DYING TODAY!!! is immensely frustrating. When the symptoms aren't there (read: persistent chest tightness), I can go weeks operating normally. But then the chest pain starts again and it enhances my anxiety and I can't talk or eat or be with friends or be in public for long or engage in physical activity outside of stretching. 
 

 I've dealt with this for years, but it peaked in July - September of last year, which got me started on my Lexapro journey. 
 

 Does anyone have good ways to frame this in your mind or good ways to relieve that chest tightness that restarts the cycle? Otherwise I just inevitably end up in a hospital or at the doctor again (and I always get the ""All clear"" as a healthy 25M)"

 Hi all,
 

 I was diagnosed w autism when I was a teenager (now I'm almost 30F), have been considering if it is social anxiety instead. But it has been quite hard to pinpoint because there is a lot of overlap:
 

 . overlapping presentations like lack of social skills, atypical eye contact, tiredness from social interactions, routine rigidity, sensory overload
 

 . co-morbidity: more than 50% of adults w ASD also have social anxiety
 

 . not sure what causes what - many people w autism develop social anxiety due to poor social skills, and many people w social anxiety develop restrictive behaviors because of anxiety
 

 . both of them show differences in amygdala functioning and they run in families
 

 Does anyone have insight on this issue?
 

 I have autistic symptoms but at this point in my life, my biggest issue I think is low self-esteem, social anxiety and anxiety in general. It is hard to pinpoint what causes the struggle, but considering if social anxiety is a better fit"
"(27M ) Had to take a walk to pick my little sister up from school. It was about 40 degrees out and I live in FL, haven't been in the cold in a few years, I'm not so used to it these days. I was running late so I started speed walking, did a light jog to get through traffic. About halfway I felt a pounding sensation that stopped me in my tracks. I'm used to these PVC-like palpitations but they still bother. I tried to keep my mind on the walk but between the cold and my racing mind it was difficult. By the time I got to the school I couldn't catch my breath my heart was racing a mile a minute and I was lightheaded. I had to power through and once I got my sister (who began talking my ear off) I got back some control and made it back home albeit still a bit lightheaded. I'm not sure what exactly triggered it. Could've been the cold, maybe my racing thoughts, maybe its the fact I had two brownies and a bowl of pasta an hour before racing out the door. No matter what...not fun, 0/10 wouldn't recommend. 🙄😒"
I struggle with health anxiety. These last few days I have had a stomach bug (I am feeling better now thankfully) but I now have this throbbing headache that comes on only upon standing on the right side of my head for a few seconds. I of course have come on here and doom scrolled and went to Google and now I think I have POTs which I don’t deny because I do have a higher heart rate upon standing 😭 I’m just really scared. Could it just be something simple like dehydration from being sick? I don’t really feel dehydrated so that’s why I don’t know 😭
"I hope someone can help me here because I need it. The past 2 weeks, I've gotten more experience with dating than I have in the past 2 decades. It is hard to believe that I just had my first kiss this past weekend, but when I was in middle and high school, I subconsciously had low self-esteem, which made me believe that I wasn't worthy of asking any girl out, despite the fact that I wasn't ugly. Maybe race had something to do with this, but then again it may have been my undiagnosed social anxiety. 
 

 In college (2014-2019), it was a similar story, except that's when I started to pay more attention to the fact that I was perpetually single. I first started posting to Reddit about all of this under the username u/fa9cmy6w34i6y98ctrqc, but I stopped posting with this account. Back then I was still somewhat reserved, but also had low self esteem. I was also at a tech college with an 80-20 male-to-female ratio, yet I lived on campus without a car. 
 

 I transferred to a larger school near home 2 years later. Part of this was for academic reasons, the other part for the lack of dating opportunities. Over the next 3 years, I joined a club and a sports team, which became my primary social outlet and where my friend circle grew from. Yet I was still extroverted, but socially anxious. The thought of losing my virginity, being a virgin and having never kissed a girl grew prominent as the years went by. 
 

 After graduation, I served in a national service program for about 6 months, traveling the country for disaster relief in a program with about 150 people, in the 18-24 age range. Again, I had a secondary goal of progressing with dating in all of this. Nothing came of it. 
 

 The pandemic hit. I went from age 23 to now 25 in this time, living at home with my parents and without social interactions. I tried using dating apps for 2 months, paid $70, and got nowhere. I deleted them to try and get my sanity back. I reinstalled them, had the same problem. In December, I did it again, but this time I used Facebook Dating, which was where I found the girl who I've been talking to and been on 2 dates with since Dec. 24. She lives an hour away. Prior to meeting her, I had only been on 4 dates in my life. I've had 6 now. 
 

 She knows that I'm inexperienced with dating, and to be honest, she's pretty isolated and shy too. Yet she's still been in a relationship or two since maybe 18-20 (she's 24). Which is expected. Still, I find myself having anxiety over our interactions. We text every day, maybe about 8-10 messages. I think things can progress well, but with the lack of privacy I mentioned in the title (we live with our parents), the only intimacy that we can have is likely in my car or a hotel room, two uncomfortable and awkward options. Yet physical intimacy is the skill that I lack. The 2 kisses we had were basic and juvenile, but then again, if I've never kissed how am I supposed to practice?
 

 I hope she isn't losing interest because she senses the lack of experience. I'm not sure where I should turn or how to think. My goal is to move out of the house by April regardless, but That can't come fast enough."
"Hi,
 

 My (29M) partner's (26F) anxiety usually gets triggered at various points during the day, but we found that they occur very frequently during the night (think post-dinnertime all the way to bedtime). These episodes (apologies if I'm not using the correct terms here) are dominated by health-related concerns - like an increased heart rate or some form of discomfort/pain felt in the chest or back.
 

 I find that at other points in her day, other potential and rather intense triggers may affect her levels of anxiety but the intensity of such episodes really pale in comparison to the ones she experiences at night. I feel worried because sometimes we aren't able to identify or name the triggers, and somehow the only takeaway for me so far is that it takes place consistently at night.
 

 Has anyone else here experienced something similar?"
I’m just trying to see if there is anyone else my age (24F) without any eye issues as far as needing glasses/contacts that have eye floaters? I normally see it’s people who are near sighted that have them but I literally have 20/20 vision and I’m struggling with why I have them so young :( I’m also afraid that because I have developed them so young that they will keep getting worse and worse (which it feels they already have) and it terrifies me 🥺 or if anyone else a little older than me had gotten them at the same age and can tell me if they have stayed the same? That would make me feel better 🥺 thank you

"As I follow this sub I see a lot of posts that are super relatable but also a lot of posts I don't relate to. I figured this is normal since everyone's social anxiety is different and affects them in different areas of life. Where does your anxiety affect you the most? Where do you not have any anxiety?
 

 

 Where I don't have anxiety-
 Job hunting, job interviews, talking to co-workers, going out to public spaces, going to bars, meeting up for scheduled social events.
 

 

 Where I have anxiety-
 Approaching new people, going out alone to meet people, starting a conversation with strangers, creating friendships and relationships, approaching women, texting someone to start a conversation with the intention of asking to hang out. Essentially, my social anxiety is most present in my social life, which makes it difficult for me to build relationships and date."
"I (25F) am not sure how to explain this without it coming off as though he’s constantly a drunk, because he’s not and I don’t feel as though that’s the issue. My boyfriend (25M) drinks socially with his friends that he sees a few times a week. He’s finishing up college currently and we hope to be moving next year when he graduates.
 

 The problem is the minute he says that he’s drunk, I get anxious. It only happens once every now and then, maybe every few weeks or so, and almost always with his friends. When I’m with him, if he drinks, I’m generally not very concerned because I’m physically there to “protect” him in a way.
 

  We don’t live together quite yet, so the nights he is with his friends without me they enjoy their time and drink socially (and excessively). But when I’m not with him, I can’t help but grow anxious. I can’t help but think about all of the things that could go wrong, and it clouds my thoughts. It’s to the point now that I start to associate his friends with him drinking, which isn’t true. They don’t always drink. However, they do like to tease my boyfriend and tell tall tales about nights where he has been blackout drunk and done stupid things, which obviously worries me more and doesn’t help my association. I feel as though I could handle him being blackout drunk as long as I’m with him to protect him. In some ways, I don’t trust his friends wholeheartedly even though I know they wouldn’t let anything too bad happen.
 

 I don’t really know how to cope with this. I’ve talked to my boyfriend about this before, because he knows I get worried about it. When I do talk about it, I feel controlling in the sense I’m telling him how to live his life. He feels as though I’m ruining his time with his friends when I act like this. 
 

 Obviously this is just surface layer and I could never explain the complexities of our entire relationship and love. But overall I know and have a feeling my anxiety is the problem, not him. I don’t really have anyone in my life who suffers with general anxiety like me, and I feel like I need some advice from people who can understand. In my ideal world he would only ever drink, or at least drink with the intention of being drunk, around me. I just don’t know how to cope with these nights where I know he’s drunk, or potentially blackout drunk, without me being physically there to sedate my anxiety."
"Wow ok so buckle up kiddos, this is going to be a wild ride hard to understand. My company is having us do a professional crisis management training (healthcare). So I went to it today. It’s a two day, 14 hour, training. My coworker and I went together and met up with these other three people for the class. One of them, you could say, caught my eye. Anyway, it was all fine and dandy until my coworker and I got back in the car to go back home. I basically had an anxiety attack thinking about the “what ifs” of talking to her, asking her out, and getting her number. Do you all experience this as well? My coworker (f27) said that it would be fine for me (m23) to ask her about what she told me she was going to do tonight, who she did it with, etc. and later ask her for her number. When I heard all of this, I panicked because it’s just so much confrontation, yet I really really want a connection for whatever reason with this person. My other friend (m25) kind of told me that I am freaking out over nothing. What do you all think? What should I do when I see her tomorrow? Any advice would be great!"

"Hello all, I (25F) am new to this thread, and I've joined due to how severe my anxiety's gotten in the last year. This is more of a vent but any tips or advice is appreciated. ‼️TW‼️ as I mention my triggers
 

 I've dealt with anxiety since childhood (not the best household) where I would get so nervous about going home it would lead to upset stomach sweaty palms and hot face/neck. So i'm familiar with the 3-3-3 rule, breathing techniques, meditation, etc.
 

 I live with one roommate now, and I've noticed I have so many more triggers now, from being in large crowds, bumper to bumper traffic, and even the chance of my food/drinks being drugged. My close friends are used to me asking for reassurance that they didn't drug anything they've offered me. It's trickier at work or with people I don't know too well so I usually decline. 
 

 I used to smoke weed and cigarettes/nicotine products but I can't anymore because I've had attacks after smoking. Same thing with coffee and I would drink coffee every day!
 

 It's gotten to the point I feel it's disrupting my life. Sometimes my brain feels like a stretched rubber band and like it's about to snap and I won't come back to sanity. I've been a bit resistant to seeking therapy or a psychiatrist as I don't want to medicate. But at this point I'm not sure what else to to do. I'm afraid of this developing into severe agoraphobia, as sometimes I won't go out to certain places/do certain things for fear OF my attacks. Even knowing it's temporary and distracting myself, I'll still feel the racing heart, my throat closing, and the pins and needles feeling on the back of my scalp. I've even had my limbs go numb and had to leave an amusement park after one ride because it kept happening. I've fainted before a surgery as well. 
 I want to try CBD but not sure if it will actually help or trigger me as I'm afraid of taking edibles anymore."

 I'm feeling stuck."
"Does anyone else struggle with body image and wants to go to the gym soo bad, but after every attempt has a panic attack if they see one girl who triggers them? 
 I have body dysmorphia. I’ve came a long way in recovery. I’ve recently thought I was ready to try going to the gym again, but I feel like all my recovery just goes out the door when I’m in the gym. I like working out. I want to be in shape, but I’m so triggered by gyms. I get thoughts about my appearance and how ugly I am. I feel so alone in this. I’ve came to Reddit posts before with my problem, but I get chewed apart and no one can seem to relate."
"So I suffer from health anxiety among other things and one thing that has always bothered me is that there's no way for me to know whether some of my physical symptoms are truly my anxiety or if it's some other problem. This has lead me to freaking out and going to the doctor on many occasions only to have everything they test come back normal. I'm always left unsatisfied, feeling like they could have just overlooked something or not tested the right thing. Everything usually just gets blamed on my anxiety but it always leaves room for doubt which keeps me in this never-ending cycle.
 

 What I'd like to know is, is there a way for them to see the anxiety at work? Like a blood test? I know cortisol and adrenaline are the hormones that are responsible for stress. Is there a way to measure them like you would vitamins or other things? Or would that be just as fruitless and possibly biased since I'd probably be extra anxious getting my blood drawn anyway(and also because they could be activated by other problems not just anxiety)?
 

 I'm just tired of feeling so miserable and having no physical evidence to back it up. It's always just a ""Well everything looks normal so I guess it was anxiety this time too"" sort of deal. I feel like I'm getting to a point where everything gets blamed on anxiety even when it seems potentially unrelated. I'm reluctant to see anymore doctors for issues that crop up because every other time I've gone its ended up feeling like a waste of time, stress, and money. I feel stupid that my anxiety tricked me yet again even though it's completely reasonable with how extreme the symptoms feel sometimes. I guess maybe I'm just looking for some validation, that I can prove it's actually capable of throwing my body off so much."
"I never had health anxiety until I reached about 20, in fact, I actively did things that could actually cause serious harm to my body when I was younger, without the slightest worry in the world. 
 

 One day, I want to say I was roughly 19, I found my life long bestfriends dad dead. It was a sudden death, no one could have foreseen it coming, it gave me a sudden awareness of my own mortality.
 

 In the following months I began to have panic attacks, which I never experienced before. I still do to this day, however I am always convinced I'm having a heart attack or stroke. Now, if I have the slightest physical symptom I will obesses about it until I eventually do end up panicking. Endless googling, checking my pulse etc. Go to the doctor, there is never anything wrong with me, just a elevated pulse from anxiety. 
 

 This died down for a long while but I now have been prescribed Adderall for my ADHD, which in turn, you guessed it, increases heart rate and blood pressure. The benifits of the medication are amazing, I for once have completely overhauled my life in all areas but for some reason, I decided to Google side effects and risk of adderall (like a idiot). Read it can increase risk of heart attack and stroke and thus the flames have been stoked again. I've been freaking out until I was talking to my girlfriend who plainly said ""you're a hypochondriac"" but I can't be! I feel this! My heart rate is fast! My blood pressure is up! Etc. 
 

 In my obsessive googling I found this sub reddit by chance and finally connected the dots that I am in fact a hypochondriac and the trauma I experienced when I was 19 manifested into this. 
 

 I'd love to hear your experiences with these issues and what you do to cope with the stress and obsessive thoughts associated with this condition. I know I'm a hypochondriac now but what is the next step I take?"
"Hi guys,
 Does anyone struggle with this? Once I watch a video of a story about cancer I start questioning everything about my symptoms and think the dr is missing something.
 

 I already wake up everyday worried about the same thing or something new. For instance the past few days it's been a mole I've been worried about. Until last night I had major major heart palpitations while laying on my right side so I started googling about AFIB.
 

 Now I watched a tik tok video about a woman who had thyroid cancer so I googled how do you diagnose thyroid cancer. I've never had an ultrasound of my thyroid before just a thyroid blood test done twice last year actually.
 

 So so worried I'm dying of something undiagnosed and tik tok triggers it all :(
 

 I've been to the dr so so so much last year it would be down right embarrassing to go again. I actually just went 3 weeks ago for something else so I feel like I'm stuck with no choice to worry about my health :("
"Hi 
 I have really really bad heart palpitations. They are so so so scary. Last night laying in bed on my right side I had the craziest amount of flip flopping until I layed on my back.
 

 I keep thinking I'm going to drop dead. I went to the cardiologist last year had a stress test done 2 ekgs everything normal.
 

 Still having them so bad so I went to a second cardiologist a couple weeks ago. He told me thinks it's my anxiety but he will give me a heart monitor to give me peace of mind. So I'm picking up the heart monitor tomorrow.
 

 Does anyone else struggle with major heart palpitations without an actual heart problem and is told its from anxiety?
 

 How do you cope? Like I said, I'm so worried I'm going to drop dead because how can this be so intense so bad and from just anxiety?
 

 I'm so scared right now :("
"Hi guys,
 I am struggling.
 

 I have horrible anxiety 90% of the time. It consumes my life. 
 I went to the dr so so much last year. ER twice. I've had ct scans done, ultrasounds done, blood work done. The works I guess. 
 

 Problem is my anxiety is causing such horrible physical symptoms that I think im going to drop dead.
 

 My palpitations are so intense so horrible. It's hard to believe it's just from anxiety. I've had a stress test done 3 ekgs all normal. I'm picking up a 30 day heart monitor tomorrow to rule out anything wrong bur the cardiologist told me he doesn't think anything is wrong, he thinks the underlying cause is anxiety. He said he is giving me this monitor for my peace of mind.
 

 Once I get one thing ruled out I start worrying about something else.
 

 I am so so so stressed out that I now haven't had a period in 3 months (sorry tmi) so now here I am worried about that and think oh great back to the dr I go.
 

 This is taking over my life and this sucks!!!!
 

 My cardiologist said maybe to try CBD to relax me but he said wait until he gets all the test results back from my echo and heart monitor before I try it out.
 

 What do you guys do naturally to help you? I don't want to take any pills 
 

 Thanks so much!"
"Hello everyone. I'm (28F) currently on a weight loss journey and thinking of incorporating green tea for all its health benefits. However, I do have diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder and my pulse often stays on the higher side because of it. I've recently consulted a cardiologist thinking I might have a heart issue but all tests are clear, and the anxiety issues are the cause. I've read that caffeine can often cause a higher pulse rate so just wondering if it would be safe for me to start drinking green tea? Although green tea has a minimal amount of caffeine compared to coffee, I'm just being wary. Anyone has any experience on this or any advice to offer? 
 

 Im 155 cm, 55 kgs (121 lbs), not taking any medication and no health conditions other than the anxiety."
"I’ve been with my boyfriend for 5 years. We recently bought a house and his sister is renting a room from us. I don’t click with her at all and her presence in the house causes me really bad anxiety. I don’t know how to address it. She brings out all of my insecurities as well. I have suffered for years and years of body image issues and finally reached a point where I’m comfortable, but I can tell she just is uncomfortable around me if we go somewhere and I’m not all dressed up and hair isn’t done perfect. I feel like I have to match her energy and it’s super uncomfortable. I want to be able to come home and not have anxiety because she’s home or be able to go into the kitchen without worrying about running into her. I’m stuck because I don’t know what’s in the bad air between us! I have gotten to know her and have done stuff with her just us together, but it’s 100% obvious that we don’t click so it’s super awkward."

"A little background I'm 28 just got demoted and had my first ever panic attack late November last year. Since then I've been having constant anxiety attacks and struggles with depression and health scares. My blood pressure was very high on my first panic attack 180/100 and I thought I was dying or having a heart attack. Since then I have been diagnosed with high blood pressure and im slighlty pre diabetic....Since December of last year I have worked extremely hard to turn my health around, I've lost 40 pounds In 2 and a half months I eat healthier i dont have any coffe or any sugar and try and stay active but my blood pressure is always either in the 125/85's or higher especially when I'm having an attack. I don't see any relief and I'm loosing my mind has anyone else gone through this? My anxiety comes out of nowhere and then I get obsessed over every possible thing like my heart rate, BP, and blood oxygen. I'm on Amlodipine for my BP and Bupropion SR for my anxiety. I just feel alone and I'm in a loosing battle. Any help or advice anyone can give me would be a blessing I don't want anxiety to control me anymore."
"I'm feeling very overwhelmed rn. I made a lot of choices that have made my life complicated at the moment, mostly have to do with a full time job and university studies. I've been like this for almost 4 years now, and I feel like I can't keep going.
 

 

 Also, I feel like I'm never gonna be loved. The guy I first fell in love with left. Many guys I've dated ever since left too. I used to be very optimistic about finding love, but now I feel lonely and like I'm never gonna find someone.
 

 

 I don't even know what's the point anymore, I'm like one year away from graduating and I'm feeling like leaving everything behind and never looking back. Like grabbing my car and getting away from it all.
 

 

 The thing is I know I'll most likely regret it, and I don't wanna lose the progress I've made so far. Still, I don't feel any good about my life right now."
My (f26) husband (29M) just tested positive for covid yesterday. I'm beyond upset. In the last year I have already lost a few relatives to covid. This is like my worst nightmare came true. I just can't believe this happened to us. We made sure to get vaccines and ALWAYS wear mask everywhere we went. The thing I don't understand is my husband literally never leaves the house so I don't understand how he could of even contracted this terrible virus. I'm so scared of whats going to happen to our family. I'm the only one working while he stays at home and is the main care taker of our 2 year old daughter. So far I'm still negative but I feel like its only a matter of time before me and my daughter get terribly sick. I'm probably going to have to take 2 weeks off work since I've been exposed and that is really going to hurt us financially as we are barely living paycheck to paycheck the way it is. I'm just one big anxious mess and just wanted to vent on the internet. Any positive comments are greatly appreciated. I don't think I have ever felt so low.

"For the past few months, I've been finding it difficult to sleep properly and I also have moments before I head to work where I feel very tense.  
 

 

 My doctor prescribed Lexapro, which has helped reduce my anxiety a bit... but now, I find myself constantly thinking about bad/unfortunate events occurring, and I get afraid to sleep. I get bad stomach aches too at times, and I also notice that I tend to feel nauseated/as if I need to throw up. 
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 I started a new job around the time this started, which my doctor believes is probably why I feel so anxious and stressed. 
 

 

 I don't sleep very well anymore, and I feel as if that's placed my mind in this loop where I start worrying and get scared, which in turn causes me to not sleep properly ... at least I think that's why I believe I haven't been sleeping too well. 
 

 

 I don't know what else I can try, as I find that my therapist's suggestions aren't really helping too much. I try to focus my breathing, and I also try to mentally distract myself... but I feel that I need to try additional things.  
 

 

 I also think that the nausea and stomach discomfort I feel also makes the problem worse in a way. I've been making an effort to exercise more, but I've still noticed that the anxiety remains the same. 
 

 

 Does anyone have any advice?"

 I have worked in caring for quite a while, I've started in a new home to help residents with dementia.
 I've done two shifts which have gone well, on an induction period with someone showing me the ropes of their routine.
 However...
 

 Tonight is the first shift I am on my own, I know what things I am doing but it's the inner voice and anxiety of ""what if I don't do this right"" ""what will they think of me if I forget this"" ""what if I'm not quick enough""..
 

 I am panicking, I've tried to calm and wrote everything down as sort of a tick off list, not to overly worry myself, however it's still panicking me.
 

 My biggest responsibility is catering dinner for all residents in my wing, and personally feeding four residents whom are bed rested upstairs. As I said I've done caring, but I'm just afraid of judgement any kind words? Or any one been through a similar experience"
"Hi guys. So I guess I’ll just get right into it — I have this extremely stressful and annoying problem where I have trouble peeing anywhere but home. It wasn’t an issue I had as a kid, and I have no idea what caused it (maybe being inside for over a year due to the pandemic didn’t help). But basically, it has escalated to me having trouble going even in private places, like a hotel room bathroom. And the problem is, I’m supposed to go on a girls trip with my friends in a few weeks. 
 

 I know it sounds crazy, not being able to pee anywhere but home. But my muscles just clench up in times of extreme anxiety, and there’s seemingly nothing I can do to make them relax except wait. And it’s all in my head! The second I get home the problem goes away. 
 

 I’m terrified. I’m so scared that what happened last time (I was in a hotel with my family and just couldn’t pee for hours. I was eventually able to go but it took HOURS and was really stressful and painful) will happen again. I’ve been trying to psyche myself up for this trip by having a more relaxed mindset about it, but I can’t deny that I’m really really scared about it. I feel like I’m walking into a trap. Like I’m just ASKING for a weekend of pain and suffering. 
 

 I am determined to go on this trip because I want to face my fears. I KNOW I can do it, but I’m so worried about causing problems. I have tools I didn’t have last time, like anxiety meds (low dose), but I’m still so scared. Just had to get this off my chest."
"I took my almost two year old to a music and movement class for little kids today. He was loving it. Unfortunately though there were a lot of people and the room started closing in on me and I felt like I couldn’t breathe. My heart started racing, etc.Thank goodness I had two good friends also there who stayed with my son while I stepped out. We ended up leaving a few minutes early though and I just hate myself right now. I can’t even take me son to do normal kid things because I’ll have a panic attack l. I’ve been doing so good the past few days and I was excited about going to this class to prove to myself that I could beat my anxiety, but no it won today. Yet again and now I feel like the worst mom 😭😭😭😭😭"
"Hi,
 I’m (26F) going through a bit of a stressful time at the moment, and whenever I’m feeling particularly stressed or anxious I develop a pain/pressure in my chest that stays for quite a long time. This has happened to me a few times in the last couple weeks and it is affecting my sleep as well. When this happens I also feel like I’m really conscious of my breathing and need to take deep breaths to get enough air as well. 
 Has anyone dealt with this, and how do you get rid of the feeling? 
 Thanks in advance :)"
"Hello!
 

 I’m a 26M and I have been diagnosed with GAD since I’m like 14.
 

 My GAD has taken me through so many ups and downs but lately, I’m getting anxiety/panic attacks during orgasm!!
 

 It is so so frustrating and I have no idea what is causing these panic attacks during orgasm :(
 

 It is frustrating me like you have no idea.
 

 It doesn’t happen every time but it has happened rather often lately.
 

 I’m a bit scared to masturbate/ have sex because I feel like I’m going to get this panic attacks during orgasm.
 

 Anyone else has experienced this before ? Any tips? What could help?"
"25F, I’ve been on buspirone for about a year now. A couple weeks ago I upped my dosage. I went from 5 mg 2x daily to 7.5 mg 2x daily. I had awful headaches to start but those have gone away and now I am experiencing sleep issues. I keep waking multiple times throughout the night. I got scared thinking maybe it is sleep apnea but now I’m wondering if it’s insomnia from the medication? Just trying to see if anyone else has had this issue by chance?"

"I (26F) was feeling brave and decided to get my COVID booster today at Walgreens. Well, I was okay until it was time to go, and then I started feeling really anxious. As soon as I went inside, it felt like I was going to cry, and my legs were heavy walking to the pharmacy counter. I spoke with one of the techs and she signed my card and gave me some paperwork. I couldn't even fill out the paperwork because I just started hyperventilating and crying. I had my fiance call the pharmacist over because I just couldn't do it. It was extremely embarrassing. The pharmacist had to scratch out the booster dose on my card and it was all just very awkward. It was honestly 0/10 and I don't know what the hell to do now :/
 

 Also, I'm not afraid of needles, I have bad pharmacophobia, so it's the medicine that scares me. I'm the same way with tablets and capsules too, and check through ingredient lists in foods and other products I use. What a shitshow."
"How common is it for anxiety to cause elevated body temperature? 
  
 I am feeling feverish and like I have an infection but I’m not sure if anxiety is behind all of this. 
  
 I feel just like I did when my wisdom teeth got infected but they have all been removed so that’s not what’s causing this."
"Hi everyone. I’ve been taking Wellbutrin xl (150mg) for 7 days now. I told my psychiatrist how I don’t struggle with depression nearly as much as anxiety and the physical symptoms of anxiety, but she still prescribed Wellbutrin. The problem is, I can’t tell if the side effects are from the meds, if they’re from me and the meds aren’t working, or if I’m overthinking everything lol. 
 

 I felt okay for the first few days, but for about 4 days now I’ve had the worst anxiety. I know that increased anxiety is (ironically) a symptom of this medication, but has anyone felt an improvement in their anxiety after being on Wellbutrin for a few weeks? 
 

 I have a very stressful trip coming up in a week and was really hoping that this medication would help me relax more, not make me even more anxious than I already was!
 

 So has anyone had luck with Wellbutrin targeted towards their anxiety? I’m just feeling even more out of control on this medication than I did before. But if I just have to bear it for a few more days/weeks, then I’ll keep taking it. I know everyone’s body is different but I would love to hear about your experiences with Wellbutrin!"
"I currently work at a moving company, and it isn't too bad However I am going through a lot mentally right now. I blew through my savings and only have 600 dollars to my name. I am going on vacation (a family trip I am forced to go on) and feel that the week away in Florida will give me time to calculate my next step, far away from my real life and pressure. I am a 25M and currently on a break from school just trying to keep my life together. I am drunk and am thinking about not going to work tomorrow. I don't want to go because it sucks and while it is good exercise is nothing I want to be doing, and am stuck. I just want some advice

 I have recently been diagnosed with GAD and OCD and can't feel the medication working ( Zoloft 50mg) because of the alcohol I guess.I really just don't know what to do anymore besides jumping off a bridge but that won't solve anything"
"Ever since I (26F) was a kid, I would have periods of anxiousness that arose when a specific stressor was occurring. Most of the time though, when that stressor had passed or I had learned to accept and cope with it, I felt normal and could go about my daily life without issues. 
 

 When Covid hit in 2020, I again became very anxious. This time it was worse than any anxiety I'd ever experienced, and I honestly felt debilitated. Because the worst of Covid lasted well over a year, I had to be on antidepressants and in therapy to help me cope with everyday life during that time. The meds helped a lot, but as the general threat of Covid lessened, I became much less anxious and my doctor and I decided I had a much better handle on my emotions, so she decided to wean me off them. 
 

 Within 4-5 months I noticed I was easily stressed out at minor situations, I felt insecure in my relationship with my fiance and questioned his love for me, I overanalyzed everything he did and said, became critical and controlling of things he did, and it took its toll. I'm not saying he is perfect, but I know looking back I definitely wasn't dealing with his general faults in a healthy way. He truly is a good man, and I love him dearly. 
 

 I decided to go back on medication again to help with my current anxiety. But I'm wondering if my supposedly situational anxiety has become more of a generalized thing? My therapist said the anxiety returned shortly after stopping my medication. I don't want to be on medication long term if I can help it."
"I(25M) am terrified of making the wrong decision. I wasn't always like this. In fact, for the the longest time I thought I had the perfect plan for how I wanted my life to go. I was actually a very decisive person and had no trouble deciding what I wanted/needed to do. At this point though, it feels like every decision that I have made has led to failure. I tried college, 4 major changes and 3 school transfers later, all I have to show for it is 5 years worth of student debt and an Adderall addiction, that I was thankfully able to fight my way through (feels like the only good decision I've made in years). Now, everytime I have to make a major decision about anything I agonize over it until I absolutely have to make a decision and the entire time all I can think about is ""What if the decision I make is the wrong one? What if I regret this decision? What if this is the decision that I make that I won't be able to recover from?"" I see everyone else around me moving forward with their lives, hitting these major milestones in their lives, and I just feel like I'm stagnating and being left behind."
"I (M26) got premoted at my office job and took a huge step forward. I've been working with a new boss whom we've become fairly friendly with over the past couple months. We always joke around at work and have lunch and stuff. Today I asked him to help me set some goals to be more productive at work. As I hit my two biggest goals this year... and I've been having motivation issues. 
 

 Well my first goal was getting promoted and breaking an 8 year dry streak. He kind of laughed and got out of there pretty quick. I was reluctant to mention it but he really bugged me to tell him what my second goal was. 
 

 Idk why I told him my second goal. I've struggled with anxiety and confidence soo much since I was 18 I just never pursued women in my adult life. I got drunk at a bar and just got lucky about a month ago.
 

 Now I'm over thinking how bad I fucked up and how stupid I look idk 😐 what I was thinking I never really get into my personal life with anyone really. 
 

 I don't wanna face the embarrasment."

"I've been having SAD for a long ass time, since I was 9 til now, I am 27. I haven't had access to many treatment options the last few years because I've been in prison for 7 years. Here are some of the treatments I have tried:
 - I've tried anti-depressants for a year, which did not work at all. 
 -I have tried CBT in group settings, which does not work because my anxiety gets so bad I can't properly express myself in front of a group of people, and talking about depression and anxiety is taboo in prison, as these groups are mostly aimed at helping people with anger management, drug addiction, and criminal thinking. 
 -I did Suboxine treatment for my drug addiction for 8 months, and this was actually the most effective treatment of them all. While I was on it, my anxiety was reduced a whole lot. I was still quiet and pretty awkward, but I actually felt more relaxed around people. Even after I got off it, I feel like it had impacted me physiologically. I would say it helped me with my anxiety when talking to someone one on one, but in a group or being around a lot of people I still can't break that barrier.
 -I wanted to try benzos but they did not offer it.
 

 The state payed for all this treatments, but I'm about to parole in a month, and will be living on my own. I want to find a good treatment for me, but I don't think i can afford any specialized treatment right now, so I wanted to experiment with psychedelics, mainly MDMA or maybe LSD, in order to open myself up, and experience a different side of myself, and hopefully that experience may help boost my confidence talking to other people and expressing myself. If I'm in front of even a few people I get a frog in my throat and I get so shy. I've been going through this for years and want to try something that'll change my life. 
 

 My question is, has anyone had any experience using psychedelics for SAD, and did they have any long term effect in your daily life? What situation would be ideal for using it my first time? What is a good dose? Any other advice or thoughts are welcome too."
"I feel chest pain in spots like some time i feel on above left breast sometimes on right. I can feel my heart beating in my chest .i have constant headache and it's so hard to focus on any other thing. I poop in installments like a single satisfaction bowel movement doens't happens. I get frequent burps . I feel the pressure to poop and whenever it comes its not solid. and i overthink a lot.i think about break up and him .but now i just want to get healthy and happy because i am not well is giving me anxiety. I feel like food is stuck in my throat . And feels dizzy sometimes. I visited doctor they gave me antacids and told me to eat light food for indigestion and GAS . They told me its all because of acid reflux And my lower abdomen feels weird and pain sometimes. I am 26 years old women btw . 
 

 

 I hope its only indigestion because in my overthinking mind I have started feeling my heart is unwell. 
 What should i do ?"

"I have a long and complicated relationship with driving that I really don't want to go into right now or we'll be here for an essay's length lol. But the TL;DR is that, despite driving on and off for almost a decade, I have pretty intense driving anxiety. I am actively working on this. I practice with my dad and am almost to the point where I feel comfortable enough to practice on my own, traffic depending.
 

 But I'm 28 years old and it's fucking embarrassing. If I need to go somewhere beyond the reach of transit that I'm unfamiliar with, I still need to ask my dad to drive me. I work from home but my office is several cities away. My goal is to be able to drive to and from that office BY MYSELF but I am still pretty far from that. It's taking longer than I anticipated to get comfortable. It's probably gonna take months, maybe even a year more... I should add that I have a clinical anxiety disorder, so it's safe to say that my relationship with driving is by no means ""normal."" 
 

 I just feel so much shame that literal 16 year olds can do this and I can't. I'm working on it, actively working on it, but it's taking such a long time. I try to remind myself that a decent number of adults can't/don't/won't drive. That if they're not relying on their parents, they're relying on their partners/friends/Uber. But it still fills me with so much shame that on occasions when I visit my office and someone asks ""oh how did you get here today?"" I have to say ""my dad drove me."" I'm pretty successful in nearly every other area of adult life (good finances, good career, good cook lol, etc.) except this. 
 

 I know I shouldn't define myself by 1 shortcoming (and everyone has at least ONE shortcoming!!!) but it's so hard because to most people driving is NBD."
"So i just had a panic attack,my hands were shaking, thoat ache, stomach ache,dizziness,my body is aching and ny chest is aching . I have been to 2 doctors because i don't feel hungry and outside food i had and it gave me vomiting so they told me that i am having a acid reflux and that's why it pains. 
 But i am so stressed that i am not well,that something is happening to me.fear of dying and that my heart is not well is taking over my mind. I cannot focus on anything. My parents are stressed about me and i feel so guilty. I don't know what to do anymore i am not well and i am taking antacids and antibiotics for stomach.
 

 Please help me! Am i the only one who is out of control"
"Just looking to see what other people deal with. Especially when it comes to GAD, panic disorder, OCD and hypochondria.. sometimes I feel so alone in these thoughts and symptoms it makes me depressed. I go see my dr next week and I think I’m finally going to give meds a shot (I’ve been too scared to try them before) . My health anxiety makes me always fear the worst with my physical symptoms. It’s comforting to hear others. Mine are (I’ll probably forget a couple): fatigue, head pressure, dizziness sometimes, fingers and toes tips feel weird, depersonalization (ugh so awful) heart palpitations sometimes, my neck and back muscles feel sore (I do have a breastfeeding toddler which could account for some of that) and I feel like 24/7 my mind is running over worst case scenarios of diseases I could have."

"I am literally struggling so bad. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been struggling with bad health anxiety for a year now. I am on buspirone 2x daily and just upped the dosage a few weeks ago. I now cannot sleep. I can fall asleep easily but just cannot stay asleep anymore. I have put myself in a rabbit hole of fearing I have sleep apnea and now I can’t sleep. Not being able to sleep is making my anxiety even worse. I have to be up for work in less than 3 hours now and I have only slept for maybe 3. I have another appt Wednesday with my doc to discuss this, but I literally can’t function. It has been constantly one thing after another for me this whole year. I have been in and out of therapy between the therapist I was first with saying Im “getting better” and terminating my therapy to having to pay out of pocket for my own and can’t afford to. I have been trying so hard to get better and nothing is working. (I am in the military so the mental health section is completely different than what you might be used to, hence why they terminated my care) I am so tired of feeling like there is constantly something wrong with me and not being able to explain to anyone how I feel, or they brush me off and tell me I’ll “be okay” I am so stuck and it makes me sick. I need help and idk what to do"
"Exactly one year ago I (25M) was in a very low place. I have had bad social anxiety / emetophobia for 14 years but I was in a new low.
 

 How bad was it?
 

 * Lost 5 kg in a span of 1 month due to constant stress and anxiety (I get nausea to the point of vomiting)
 * Couldn't sleep due to panic attacks from fear of future social embarrassment
 * Had to exit a job interview to throw up
 * Had to throw up before exams
 * Got anxiety from getting groceries
 * Anxiety from casual eating with friends/family
 * The list goes on...
 

 Now I have my first fulltime job (and close to no anxiety). A lovely and beautiful girlfriend (going out to eat, vacationing, and meeting her family). And I crossed off multiple of my greatest trigger situations (presenting for people, eating with people, meeting parents in law, going on dates, ...).
 

 How did I do it?
 

 * Exposure therapy (repetitively doing exercises of: asking cashier the time; going on dates; talking in meetings, etc.) 
 * Cognitive Therapy (basically trying to brainwash myself with positive visualizations through recordings my psychotherapist created)
 * Improved my appearance and started tinder (even though I was VERY bad at it in the beginning)
 * Low dose of Sertraline (25 mg)
 

 EDIT; I don't really know how much the Sertraline affects me (if at all). I started all of the above 4 approaches simultaneously so it hard for me to say what did what. I credit most of my success to the exposure therapy, cognitive therapy, and dating.
 

 Feel free to ask me anything :D"
"I know this will probably sound a bit ridiculous to some people. I'm not usually all that superstitious but for some reason I've gotten it in my head not to verbally acknowledge when I'm feeling better or enjoying something because I'm afraid it'll somehow remind the universe that I'm supposed to be feeling bad. I know that doesn't make much sense and logically I know whether I feel bad has very little to do with whether I acknowledge better times but I can't help but at least tone it down when I mention it. For example, if someone asks how I'm doing after a particularly rough patch my response is always ""a little bit"" better, as if toning it down with ""a little bit"" will somehow prevent triggering something bad. As if some divine force would be like ""oh, she's only doing a little bit better, no need to beat her down yet"". I'm less hesitant saying I had a good time somewhere or doing something if it's after the fact because if its already over then there's no way to really ruin it. 
 

 Superstition isn't always the only reason for me avoiding saying I'm doing better but the other reason has more to do with other people. I don't want to say I'm doing better and give them the wrong idea that I'm now 100% better. I don't want them to think, ""oh she's doing better, I'll invite her to do stuff now"" because my version of better is not their version of better. Better to me is I'm able to function very slightly above the bare minimum.
 

 Anyone else like this?"
"I feel pathetic. I'm too scared to come out to eat, so my boyfriend brings back food. I have dirty laundry sitting in my room because I'm scared to come out to use the washer and dryer. He is starting his new job tomorrow so I'll be alone in the house with this woman. She is super nice, but I feel like I've already made myself look weird by not coming out. I've been having regular panic attacks again as I look for work as well. Taking CBD gummies multiple times per day isn't really helping me. I just slept twelve hours so I don't have to face my anxiety. This sucks so much. We went from having our own one-bedroom apartment to living here. I'm about to just live in my car. I hate living with a stranger. Our rent is half of what it was before, so saving money is definitely a plus, but it's not for me. I just want to have our own place. We couldn't find anywhere else in time before my boyfriend had to be here for training. We moved six hours away and had two weeks to find a place."
"I always feel like I never have enough time to do anything despite starting everything early. I get extreme anxiety that every minute I can't figure out a problem or am not doing what I said I would, I'm wasting time and am an idiot. Then I freak our and waste more time, causing a positive feedback loop. This is especially bad at work; I know I'm smart and can do what I need to but I struggle against the clocks and struggle to ask for help. Any advice on how to a) not freak out against the clock and b) just ask for some damn help?"
"*trigger warning**
 

 Hey everyone. I posted here earlier. My boyfriend and I just moved six hours from where we used to live, and I'm in a situation where I have to look for a 9-5. I just canceled my job interviews tomorrow because not only do I think I have covid from my parents who have been traveling, but I'm having panic attack after panic attack and I'm struggling to not hurt myself right now. My boyfriend is starting his new job tomorrow, but I'll have nothing to do and it's all my fault. When we lived in a bigger city, I was able to push past my anxiety to do things like food deliveries &amp; pet sitting, but now we live in a much smaller place and the demand isn't there. I was actually making a living doing those things. I was also volunteering at an animal shelter, but I had to quit once we moved.
 

 I feel like the worst person alive right now. I just want to die. I've been struggling with SA all my life. I feel like the only way out of this is to kill myself. I have an English degree, but I don't want to be a teacher, so it feels useless. I apply to remote jobs and hear nothing back. I'm running out of money. My bf has the means to support both of us and says we'll get through it, but getting by only because of him makes me feel like a massive burden.
 

 That's it, really. I'm about to kill myself over this. Or be homeless. Whichever comes first. No idea how ""normal"" people function in society and go to work everyday. I can't think of anything worse than dealing with the general public. I become overstimulated just sitting in a restaurant or going into shops. I hate having the rest of my life ahead of me to deal with this.
 

 Even if you don't have any advice, that's okay. I just feel so alone."
"Hi
 I'm 25 years old female and I find it extremely problematic to be in any social situation. We recently changed to work from office and even though one on one interactions are not that hard for me, I tend to face extreme anxiety when eating at the cafeteria with others. I start hyperventilating, sweating and feeling nauseated when I sit down to eat. So I try to go in early when there's less people but that's too soon for others to have lunch which means I'll be alone while eating rather than with someone I know(which helps distracting my mind sometimes. I like being alone but once people start flowing into the cafe, my anxiety spikes up). Work from office seems to have exacerbated my anxiety troubles compared to wfh when I had flexibility and control over my emotions in the midst of my family. To top it off I am an introvert which means making acquaintances is that much harder for me. Is there some tips or tricks or suggestions to calm the mind in such situations?"
"To be simultaneously anxious and bored at work?
 

 For context I work a desk job. Some days are busy, but most aren't. I run through my task list and see nothing to do and that causes me anxiety. I think that I'm forgetting something, or maybe I didn't do something correctly or that I'm missing something. I also constantly worry that I'm f**king up despite that I've been here for 2 1/2 years.
 

 Is this normal? Any help?"
"""People person, outgoing, must love talking to people, bubbly"" however they put it. It's infuriating. I just want to close my laptop now. Even if I didn't have SA, I'm naturally very introverted and shy so it's very disheartening to see things like that in the job description. I feel like there's nothing out there for me. I'm also looking for remote work, but I don't have most of the qualifications that they're looking for. It's truly hopeless."
"My partner (f29) is afraid of the dark. When I (m31) am around, it's kind of manageable, but it's much worse when I sleep over somewhere else. It puts a lot of stress on her.
 

 The anxiety is inside the house, she's leaving different lights on and our dog sleeps in his own corner in the bedroom
 

 

 Can you give us some advise?"
"I (29M) have social anxiety. I used to think it wasn’t so bad. I lived with my parents until a few months ago, finally bought a house and brought in a friend to help with the bills. First couple weeks were great. I realized after a couple weeks that my roommate is usually out doing something fun where as I just wake up, go to work, smoke a little and play video games. It’s not fun anymore. She has got me to get out more this past month as she could tell I was unhappy but for me I had trouble with it. 
 

 I used to love getting out then I had my best closest friend kill himself and I basically shut down. That was when all I cared about was work and video games. This was 8 years ago and I stopped going out, slept until an hour before my shift (wake at 2pm and work until 11:30), stayed up until 6am playing video games then slept and repeat. Every once in awhile one of my (very few) friends would hit me up and ask me to go out for a drink or a fire at their place. I’m usually okay after a few drinks and loosen up but alone I would just turn into a robot. 
 

 A few weeks ago, I had a dream that felt so real that it really depressed me and made me want change badly. I’ve never had a girlfriend, been kissed once and am still a virgin and it sucks at this point. 
 

 I tried to go to the bar alone one night because I was sad and just wanted to unwind. I ended up just drinking and playing on my phone because I got nervous once I walked in. 
 

 I actually want change. I have a therapy appt coming up because I need to get some built up emotions out of me and it’s things I don’t really feel comfortable talking about my friends with (fear of rejection if they don’t understand, I can’t lose the few friends I have). Does anyone have tips of how to overcome this? I think I also have depression as I feel I have a voice in my head saying “why do this, why do that, you’ll make a fool of yourself” and in public I always feel like I’m being judged. I know no one is but mind just keeps telling myself I am being judged. I just want change, I want to be happy, I want to enjoy what’s left of my life"
"I (F27) don’t know what to do anymore. I’m at my wits end, just feeling completely hopeless.
 I’ve been trying to find a therapist, counselor, anyone, but that’s proving impossible.
 

 I’m waking up into attacks, I can hardly leave my home anymore, I haven’t gone to a physical job in 2 years, I am becoming an agoraphobic recluse (good bit due to the state of the world), and I am trying to hang on but I feel like I’m losing my mind.
 *I have adverse reactions to SSRIs so I’m on L-Theanine and Ashwagandha supplements*
 

 I had a therapist last year and I did everything he said. Quit caffeine, quit vaping, got on a “normal” sleep schedule, exercising. 
 

 It also doesn’t help that I’m in a really unhealthy household reliving my trauma daily, and I recognize that, but I feel like I should still be able to find some kind of solace. 
 

 If you’re still here, thank you. I just need to vent because I don’t really have anyone to talk to that I haven’t already driven crazy with my anxiety ramblings. 🖤"
"I just can't. If it's not one symptom, is the other. They vary, they come and go. Even though I know I worry too much and I'm paying way too much attention to my body, to each little thing I feel or see, I still freak out.
 I have been dealing with an irritated/dry throat for days now and I'm freaking out. I think I have acid reflux, and the humidity outside is below 40% most of the day. But I still freak out. It doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt to swallow either, I haven't vomited, I'm not coughing.. then what is it??? 
 My stomach feels way better these days, but sometimes I wake up feeling a bit weird, and with an acid feeling on my throat and sometimes mouth.
 Thing is, I can't go to a doctor and that freaks me out even worse. I have no insurance, no money, and can't even find a doctor to go to anyways..
 Sorry for the long read. 
 Hope you're well today! 
 Thanks for your time."
"(Throwaway account because she knows my real one)
 

 Looking for a bit of advice. My (29F) closest friend (33F) has severe anxiety associated with public speaking. We work in the same professional field, and unfortunately, the job requires occasionally speaking at large events. This fall, she will have to give a presentation at a national meeting; it's not in question that she is prepared and will do very well, but this is the largest event she's ever spoken at and I can tell the dread is already really affecting her.
 

 I will be accompanying her to the conference, and we're sharing a room so I'll be with her leading up to the event (unfortunately, it's on the last day, so there will be a lot of lead-up time). I know I can't do anything to take away the anxiety. She does have an appointment with a professional in the near future, so I am hopeful that will be a step in the right direction for her - but I know my own limitations, I'm not trying to ""fix"" anything. But she's the world to me, and I just want to do everything I can to make that time even a little more bearable.
 

 I have relatively mild anxiety, but I have severe depression, and I know I get very frustrated at times with the things people (even well-meaning!) will say to me. One of the reasons we became so close is because she's always been amazing at supporting me and being there, so I want to return that favor. So I guess my question is, does anyone have any advice on ways I can best support her and be a good friend to her during these stressful few days? Things to say/do (or not say/do!) leading up to a high-anxiety event? 
 

 Thanks in advance."
"Every day I feel my throat is irritated or dry. It doesn't hurt to swallow, it's not difficult to do so either. It's just that. An irritated, dry feeling, and if I look at it in the mirror, it looks red. It's been like this every day for about a week and a half now, but also on an off for longer than that.
 I don't have a cough, I don't have a fever, literally the only symptom is that 
 A few things to have in mind:
 -I might have acid reflux while I sleep. A few times I have woken up in the morning with a very acid feeling in my throat, and a bit of an acid taste in my mouth. 
 - The weather here is really hot and dry. More than 30°C every day, and it rarely goes above 45% humidity. 
 - The walls and roof in my apartment have a bit of humidity left from winter. It's not black mold, but it's still something. I've been told it's harmless, but maybe it's irritating?
 - Like I said, that's literally the only symptom in my throat and the back of my mouth. I can eat and drink just fine, no problems. When I do so, I feel fine. 
 

 Anyone had an experience with this? Is it the reflux? The dry weather? Is cancer a possibility? 
 I'm terrified I might have throat or esophagus cancer. Does it sound like it?
 Thank you."
"Was having stomach issues and abdominal pain for a while that started out of nowhere. Coincidentally a week before I had high Bilirubin in my blood work despite all else being fine. This of course took me down the pancreatic cancer rabbit hole and I’m still trying to climb out. Started manifesting symptoms, etc. 
 

 The worst thing I could’ve done was read the pancreatic cancer sub and cancer subs. I thought it would be helpful. I thought I could read through comment histories of redditors with cancer and find that they all had some red flag that I’m missing. But what always killed my anxiety is that wasn’t always the case. Not that they would mention in comments anyways. It was always just some random symptom and then cancer, otherwise always healthy, no history, young, etc. That shit triggered my anxiety worse than anything
 

 After a CT scan I finally moved a bit past the pancreas cancer fear, but then just last night I found a Reddit thread about cancer and perused some random persons profile and it just completely set me back. Just some random having stomach pains, only a few years older than me, and it’s cancer. Why. 
 

 There is a flip side of this though, something that helps me a lot is reading through older posts on this sub (~a year ago or many months ago) and clicking on the users profile. When you realize how many users post here with symptoms, convinced they have cancer or a brain tumor or a heart issue, and then you see their profiles and a year later they’re still totally fine or healthy, it puts into perspective how many of us have anxiety and for how few of us it will actually be legitimate.
 

 That helped me a little bit, but now as I’m sitting here itchy as I’ve never been in the past I need to try and get past this currently anxious regression 😔"
"Hi everyone, I'm 26 y old femaole and I'm so depressed and stressed I can't stop crying and I don't eant to be anymore, lying on the floor right now and thinking that it would ve been better if I didn't breathe, any help or comments is appreciated please help :''''("
"The anxious part of my brain is screaming “DON’T MAKE THIS POST, YOU’LL JINX IT!!”, but I am determined to push past that bitch and be proud of the fact that I am going on a fun trip tomorrow!
 

 For months now, I’ve dreaded a girls trip that some friends and I are going on this weekend. My anxiety presents itself with intense physical symptoms (stomach issues, dizziness, you know the drill) plus a pretty annoying case of shy bladder syndrome, which causes endless anxiety in me. For these reasons, I’ve been dreading this trip, and agonized about canceling probably hundreds of times. 
 

 But today, the day before trip, I just decided that enough was enough. I’m done worrying about things that haven’t happened yet. I’m done worrying about a worst case scenario that doesn’t have to exist! My anxiety does not have to ruin my life! I am determined to go on this trip and have a good time. I deserve it! 
 

 I’ve been psyching myself up for this trip for weeks now, so I feel as prepared as I ever could be to go and have a good time. I started anxiety meds a couple weeks ago, I’ve talked it out until I was blue in the face, I’ve cried about it…I’m done letting my fears control me. I’m not expecting it to be perfect, as my generalized anxiety will always be there, but in this moment I feel strong enough to at least TRY. And that’s half the battle!
 

 Wish me luck!!"
"How do you get over sleep anxiety? I fear I have sleep apnea or something because I keep waking up and not being able to go back to sleep. I have no issues falling asleep usually, it’s just staying asleep. This morning I woke up at 2:30 am and never went back to sleep. I’m waiting to get a sleep study done just to be sure it’s all my anxiety, so until then I wanted to see what you all do to help get past it?"
"Hi everybody, I’ve posted before that I have a huge fear of my boyfriend dying. After he schedule a knee surgery back in April, I convinced myself something bad will happen during the surgery or after, and then that developed into me worrying about everything that could go wrong with him, even before the surgery. Making him get useless tests, calling him nonstop, not listening to songs because I’m convinced he will die if I do…but now it’s just this “feeling” I have that he will die..his surgery is in a months and it got postponed so much that I just have this feeling that’s always there. The thoughts are hurt so automatic now that I don’t even make plans for the future because I automatically think he’s just not gonna be there. I spend so much time on the widows subreddit to prepare and compare situations. And if I read about a Lobe story on there that sounds like mine I panic. Is this just me knowing he’s going to die soon? Or anxiety? Please help me in at my last straw"
"Does this sound like it could be anxiety as well? I am diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder as well
 

 I have been suffering with shortness of breath for many years I am (25M) this started around age 8, I also do have a form of Tourette’s I should say, I have had vocal and facial tics since around that age , also a persistent cough/throat clearing tic , I always feel the need to throat clear or cough to get a full breath, if I don’t throat clear or cough, I get this uncomfortable suffocating feeling in my chest and throat, and I’m in need of a constant urge of taking a deep breath , so after I am okay with a Few normal breaths on my own , but then the feeling of suffocation intervenes and I will need to throat clear / or fake cough or sometimes even a squeak like tic sound outwards to feel the need to be able to get a deep satisfied breath in 
 

 Some of my tics and suffocation feeling feel worse after eating anything with “spices”milk”onions”tomatoes products
 I have been tested for asthma but apparently everything is fine 
 

 Also my shortness of breath gets worse around harsh perfumes or anything strong smelling , also around my dogs/cats?
 

 And again I’m not allergic too animals as far as I know , so I can’t figure out why I have had this for many years :( and I don’t know what to say or describe to my doctors other then they say it’s anxiety related , but I’m like this 24/7 without being anxious , and gets worse with certain foods I eat or drink 
 

 It feels like I can’t take a deep breath in” 24/7 but if I drink or have anything with milk in it , this feels 10 times worse ,
 

 It gets that bad , I sometimes can’t even have a full conversation without pausing in between and throat clearing or fake cough, or squeaking tic” like I want to get all my words out fast ?
 

 Any help or incite would be gratefully appreciated I’ve suffered with this for so long"
"I started group therapy 3 weeks ago, always got 100 minuits of therapy session every friday. Im the only person in the group (up to 6 or 7 people) who has a social anxiety disorder, I dont really know what the other people struggle with. I think its mostly depression. 
 

 In the session there is a therapist, but he doesnt give any structure. He sits down with us and we start the session and just talk about our problems., ask each other questions and comment about the other peoples struggles. 
 

 

 In the first session I tried to introduce myself but couldnt do it completly, just started crying feeling all the pressure, anxiety and stress. In the second session we were only 2 people so it was easier, I could talk about some of my problems. Then on the third one, today, we were 4 people and I could not bring myself to talk a single time in the 100 minuits. Just 1 hour and 40 minuits of silence from me. The other 3 talked the entire time, shared their problems, commented on them, asked each other questions. 
 

 They are all so out going, extroverted, opiniated. They can talk for hours in such an animated and confident way. And then theres me, so extremly intimidated it felt impossible to chime in or just to ask a simple question. I feel like a freak. Like I'm an alien. 
 

 I dont know how to approach these sessions, how to spin them in a positive way, how to gain something out of them. I just end up comparing myslef to the other people, and being very disappointed in myself. 
 

 At the same time I have to get used to this at some point. I'm already 27 years old. I cant spend my entire life avoiding group situations and keeping quiet all the time. 
 

 Did anyone go through the same? any advice for me? Cause right now I just feel like crying and quitting."
"I’m just asking if anyone else has anxiety about their vision or their vision causes anxiety? It might have to do with depersonalization or derealization, but a lot of the times I feel like I’m not looking through my eyes? Or that it’s hard to focus on things the way I used to? Walking outside without sunglasses never used to bother my eyes and now it does. When I focusing on someone talking it feels like the Room is going darker, it’s the weirdest thing. Once I snap out of the focus it gets better, but I’m curious if anyone else here struggles with that? I also get random flashes of light and I have this one spot that comes and goes and I’m afraid it’s damage from a bright LED light that came on in my face and now it appears and disappears randomly."
I’ve had pretty severe anxiety for the last 3 years (28F) lately I’ve had this weird thing where when I try to fall asleep no matter how exhausted I am my brain/body stops it. I’ll shut my eyes and get flashes of the most frightening images like a movie reel in my head like a nightmare but I’m totally awake. When I try and get past those and really try to relax my mind to get some sleep I get surges of warmth throughout my whole body like something bad is gonna happen if I go to sleep. It’s terrifying and I don’t know what to do I’m so tired but somehow I’ve created sleep anxiety or having sleep panic attacks. Anyone else have this? Or something similar?
"This epiphany struck me pretty hard today. I’ve looked up so much self-help advice for my social anxiety, constantly looking for some solution. The general advice is basically exposure therapy: keep going out of your comfort zone and attending meetups until things become easier. That’s all well and good if you can actually speak up at those things, but if anyone else is like me, it feels like your mouth is sewn shut. This is the part that’s really kept me from growing as a person, and I’ve been frustrated that I can’t find any way to work around it. 
 

 But there isn’t any way. You just have to talk to someone, and if you can’t, then you won’t. There’s no way to make it easier, no magic bullet to start the conversation. It’s like a paraplegic looking for some miracle cure to be able to walk again. 
 

 Has anyone else dealt with this? How do you cope with it? I feel broken and powerless knowing that I’ll never be able to talk freely or have friends or just live my life to the fullest."
"Hi all, I'm 27 F and have been struggling with mental health my entire life. In the past year, I've started having more panic attacks which have slowly turned into debilitating day to day panic. Ive been diagnosed with GAD, and suspect OCD as well, but I've never had anything as severe as this. I can barely function, and I feel like I'm living in one giant panic attack about very irrational things. I have these moments of feeling ""sober"", where I see how irrational I was being. 
 

 I have been taking 300 mg Wellbutrin for 1.5 years that I originally thought was causing this, so I've tapered down to 100 mg. I just was prescribed Buspar 10 mg X2 a day as well, along with propanolol and hydroxine as needed. Nothing really feels like it helps.
 

  I definitely have specific things that trigger me, and I'm going through a stressful time, but still have never experienced anything like this. It feels like something is very physically wrong, and I'm worried and scared for the future. I did some blood work and my thyroid is normal.
 

 Does anyone have any thoughts or advice?"
"I (26M) am going away from my hometown for several months in the fall, to test whether or not I want to move to a specific city that I have wanted to live in for a while for good. This is supposed to help me to ease my anxiety about moving away permanently a bit, but somehow, even thinking about those few months has been giving me horrible anxiety, considering it will be the longest I have ever been away from my hometown without support from family (the longest I have been away was 1.5 months on a French language learning program that had everything included, but I have also lived on my university campus for a few months but my parents live close by), and I feel so embarrassed over it. It's also the first time I will try adulting (paying rent, cooking for myself, etc.) outside of a vacation (when I lived on campus my parents paid my rent) and it feels so foreign and scary. It just feels so shameful and worrying that I may not be able to do as much as I want as I'll always be consumed by fear."
"Hey everyone. I (27F) quit my teaching assistant job last month for several reasons, mainly bc the stress just wasn’t worth the dismal pay. I have a degree in education, and I haven’t had a job outside that field in several years, but I really think I’m done with that line of work.. I didn’t secure another job before I quit, so I have been doing grocery delivery for the past few weeks. I actually do like doing it, it’s nice bc I don’t have to talk to many people. I love working by myself! But, I’m barely making as much as my last job. I really need another at least part-time job with set hours/pay. I don’t want to go back to retail or fast food, and I know there’s other options out there, but I just feel so overwhelmed by it all… but I have to do SOMETHING to make more money. My boyfriend is about to start his last semester of college and is really stressed about having to work full-time and do school, all while possibly having to find another place to live bc our rent may very well go up a lot more than we expected if we sign another lease in a couple months. Any helpful tips/tricks would be appreciated!"

"Hello guys i’m (F28) long story short I'm the scapegoat in my family this year I become too sensitive to anything that reminds me of how I was treated as a kid ignored, left out, gaslighted, and always in the wrong, disrespect, they even left food for everyone and never for me... Anyway, I developed this unhealthy habit of compare the difference between the way they treat each other and how they treat me I know I'm digging my own grave i tried to stop it but I couldn’t so any interaction with theme gets me anxious and have a lot of bad thoughts and sometimes I had panic attacks tbh my life now is better than it was when I was a child but my mind is worse. I don't want to be jealous of my siblings so I try not to interact with them as much as possible but we are a big family and it’s difficult to do it.

"So I’ve been cutting my own hair for the last few years (27m) but I was debating going to a barbershop again before a trip I’m going on. 
 

 Hair has always been a source of anxiety for me. Problem is every time I think about the barbershop I feel anxious. It always feels like everyone’s watching and I think being stuck in a chair possibly making small talk just adds to it.

"I have been quite stressed recently with work and other things and was on a long drive back home today after visiting friends for the weekend. For background, I didn’t get much sleep and was drinking a bit Friday and Saturday. Out of nowhere I felt a severe wave of dread, fear and anxiousness I’ve never felt before. I got very dizzy, weak, light headed, my heart rate increased significantly, shortness of breath and my arms and hands were tingly. I thought I was having a heart attack and felt like I was going to pass out. I pulled over and let my girlfriend drive while I tried to calm down. The worst of it lasted for about 10 -20 minutes and then happened to a lesser extent again maybe 2 or 3 more times over the course of an hour or so. I have come down from it at this point but feel extremely tired and tense.I’m worried it will happen again as I can’t stop thinking about how terrible it felt and the fact that I have never experienced anything like it. Is there a reason why this happened to me for the first time as a grown adult and any advice on how to handle moving forward?"
"Ok this isn’t a joke, just bear with me a moment. What if it’s not us but them? What if we lived in a society where those of us who are hyper alert and in our minds are actually blessed? What it’s a unique skill to be thinking so much? Isn’t the fact that we are so acutely conscious an indicator that we are not Mindlessly going through life? We think about everything, we are so much more observant, I think it is a skill that most people cannot comprehend. Sure it can make us indecisive, but imagine what our potential could be if we can think while deciding what to say all the time? 
 

 It’s almost like we’re awakened, we’re just on another plane of consciousness and we just don’t understand what it means. I think we have a gift but we are just unaware of it’s potential or how to use it. We don’t need to be thoughtless, we just need to consciously direct our thoughts."

"Oh boy, another lost, toxic dude looking for advice because he can't afford counselling but for what it's worth thank you for reading!
 

 Okay, where to start. I suppose the crux of my issue is that I keep finding myself getting caught up in my own bs feelings and ""riding that wave"" for lack of a better term. In those moments of hurt, even ones quite trivial I find my brain really putting time into fixating on it and boy gee do I feel genuine hurt. I find myself getting so stressed and worked up to the point of loss of appetite. Obviously I can look back objectively and see exactly what I'm doing wrong but I just can't seem to catch myself before I allow them to get blow out of proportion in my own head. And boom, I'm being a butthead to the LOML. 
 

 My partner and pals think I've recently developed anxiety over my previous (really not good) relationship and a SA that both took place within the last 2 years which is pretty spicy and something I need to put the research into but it's quite overwhelming to hear in your mid 20's ya know. 
 

 Okay I may have down played the loss of appetite thing, I think I eat a tiny meal a day and started stress vomiting. Why is my noggin hurting my stomach so much :( 
 

 TLDR: I'm fixating on issues and can't seem to find up with a method to catch myself before I fall too deep into the hurt. Does anyone know good methods that might help me get this under control?
 

 Excuse me if anything is unclear, I'm certainly no wordsmith or eloquent enough to do better right now but I'm happy to elaborate further if anyone wants to know more! 
 

 Thank you!

"Hey guys,
 

 Ive come to this sub today to talk about my experiences at the doctor, and ask for your experiences and maybe get some tips on how to deal with this type of situation.
 

 For context: I (25f) am in therapy since about 6 months ago. My therapist and me get along great, my panic attacs have drastically reduced, and i feel like i am making great progress in a lot of the fields that trigger me to become severely anxious.
 Physically, i have been vulnerable to all kinds of infections, mostly those that infect your airways and digestive tract, since i was a teenager. I had epilepsy back then with grand mal seizures regularly, which where only controllable with heavy medication. My epilepsy has long passed now, and i dont have to take any meds. But now, whenever i go to the doctor for feeling ill, they make it about my anxiety and try to explain everything away with it.
 I went to the doctors office today after following my therapists request to do so.
 See, as I dont feel like the doctors, even after changing office, help me, i avoid going there and my therapist had to ask me to go there for a problem i had for months if not years.
 This problem revolves around my gut health, i have started throwing up without any visible reason and every 2-4 days about a month ago, following several months of heavy nausea and bowel problems. 
 So today i followed his advice and went to the doctor, with stomach pain and my all time buddy, nausea. 
 Talking to the physician i explained that i have had digestive issues for years and they are suddenly growing stronger now, making studying and everyday life hard. My sister has had celiac disease since birth, and since my many symptoms might lead to the same diagnosis, i asked the physician to have me tested for that. Celiac becomes more common in our world and is often overlooked, sometimes people have to suffer for several years without getting diagnosed. 
 So i asked her, and she said fine, lets make an appointement to test you, but first let me inspect your abdomen.
 So i laid down, pulled up my tshirt, and she put pressure on different spots on my abdomen, many of them very painfull, which i immediatly told her.
 She suddenly stopped, stared into my eyes, and asked me ""you are going to therapy, right?"" To which i replied ""yes, i do, once a week."". After about 5 seconds of silence she, still standing over me, replied :"" have you ever considered a stationary visit at a psycological clinic, for a couple of days?""..... i was speechless, then overwhelmed. I told her that my therapy is going great, my panic attacs have drastically went down, i am making big steps and have a therapist that i am extremely grateful for. She then said ""thats great, but i can see you suffering under your circumstances right now, so maybe a stationary visit is something you should think about, and talk to your therapist about."". Again, speecheless. Of course i was suffering under my circumstances, thats why i came to her office, i was throwing up for weeks which never happened before, i have stomach pain, no appetite, and am dizzy every day, sometimes so dizzy i can barely walk. Her reply left me frightened by the idea of staying in a mental facility, knowing that this would definitely cost me my job as a state official worker ( the state made it hard for me to start therapy in the first place, being in a facility would definitely be too much for them to see me as capable for my position), kind of insulted by her making assumptions off of her tiny knowledge about my mental state as she only knew that i am in therapy but thats all the information she has, questioning my own sanity and the image i seem to display, according to her a wreck that needs 24/7 help, according to my therapist, my bf, my family and me a person that has had lots of hardships and developed a mental illness that is very very common, and who is currently learning how to deal with her mind, making progress and navigating her life well. 
 

 Conclusive : today was, once again, a day of disappointement for me. I was able to make an appointement with the gastroenterological specialist right next door to my normal doctors office, but left in tears as i was in pain, without meds or tips on how to make my symptoms go mild or disappear, and felt completely misunderstood again. I know that she thinks my mind is causing all my issues. She does not care that my health has detiriorated since i was epileptic. I have Anxiety, so that must be it.
 

 Sometimes, when i feel very ill, when i come home after having a heavily infected throat for 6 weeks and a physician tells me ""i think your issues are psychosomatic"", even though my purulent tonsils say otherwise, i start to worry about me getting older, eventually developing a serious illness, and being denied treatment because i have anxiety, and according to them there is no need to screen me, one look into my documents will be enough for them.
 

 Please, guys, tell me about your experiences, i would gladly take any kind of recommendations on how to be more persistent with an uninterested doctor ( and yes i have changed offices before), and on how to deal with my emotions about being treated the way the treat my physical health."
"Hello all! 
 

 Ive recently come to terms with my anxiety and was hoping some advice to best help me manage. If you could give one piece of advice, what would it be?"
[removed]
"Hey guys, this is going to be an extremely long post about what I've been going through the past 3 months, and if you don't want to read I completely understand. Writing my experience and feelings feels therapeutic for me, so even if I don't get any advice on this, then that's okay with me.
 

 Quick backstory on me, after high school, I was a full-time student with 2-3 jobs at a time, had a bunch of friends, went out almost every single weekend, and worked jobs where I had to travel/commute. My dream since I was 13 was to be a nurse, and I finally graduated from nursing school at the end of 2021. Keep in mind that I was diagnosed with GAD and depression at 18 and was on 10 mg Lexapro, and I had anxiety here and there but I was still a fully functioning human being and was able to make it through school + jobs just fine. I actually graduated top 3 of my class. But I've had anxiety from the age of 9 up until today, so anxiety was always a struggle.
 

 I got my first nursing job right after graduating, and it was a travel covid-testing job where I would go to a bunch of schools around my area and perform covid tests. Job was extremely easy, hours were flexible, and the pay was amazing. Fast forward to 9 months later, and my contract with them ended. I saved up so much money from that job that I decided to finally take a much-needed break after working and going to school 24/7 for the past 7 years.
 

 My memory of what happened after that is extremely foggy, but the best way to describe how it felt was it was as if I woke up one morning and everything about myself, my personality, my drive, my determination, my ambition, my sense of humor; it all left me, and all that was left was my anxiety and depression. I spent the first month or so of my break curled up in my bed in the fetal position with racing thoughts, a pounding heartbeat, sweating, hyperventilating, dizziness... and it got to a point where I couldn't drive, I couldn't work, I couldn't walk my dog, I couldn't even get myself up to grab myself water anymore. I consulted every single professional that could help me; my primary care physician, a therapist, a hypnotherapist, and a psychiatrist. I've been on medication therapy for the past 3 months now and over the course of these 3 months, I've tried Wellbutrin XR 150 and 75 mg, Buspar 7.5 mg, Vistaril 25 mg, Trazodone 50mg, Effexor 75 and 37.5 mg, and I'm currently on Atenolol 50mg + Klonopin 0.25 mg. All of these medications gave me horrible, *HORRIBLE* side effects to the point where I actually was admitted to the ER because I thought I was legitimately dying. $10,000 later, and they told me all my vitals and lab results are completely normal and I just had a really bad panic attack.
 

 I used to be someone who loved every single aspect of life and what came with it. All the obstacles and trials and setbacks made me feel like it was shaping me into a better person. All the trauma I experienced growing up made me grateful for shaping me into the person I was. But after this, it feels like all of that is gone. It feels like I'm now an empty shell that's watching myself from a distance like a movie slowly watching myself disappear, and I have no control. My entire world revolves around anxiety, and if this is how I'm gonna be for the rest of my life, I'd rather just not.
 

 I'm running out of hope. I wake up every single morning anxious, I get dressed and I'm dizzy and lightheaded and my heart is beating out of my chest. I drive myself only short distances and am hyperaware of every single thing I do that will make my anxiety worse. I can barely visit my family anymore because I always have to leave early because my anxiety is out of control.
 

 I've lost control. I'm trying to stay positive but any thoughts of positivity in my head now gets overruled by anxiety and suicidal ideation. I just landed 2 jobs, got accepted into my dream nursing school to further my education, and managed to be able to drive myself again. But I can't even be proud of myself because it feels like I haven't made improvements because I'm still living in constant fear and torment within my own head.
 

 My next appointment with my psychiatrist is on August 23, and I'm wondering if I should try to go back on an SSRI, but with how bad my anxiety has gotten, I'm not sure if that'll be strong enough anymore. I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to keep going through trial periods with these medications. 
 

 I'm at rock bottom, and I just want my old self back."
"I learned to drive in 2017/18 from scratch with an instructor. I had no car myself. All lessons were in his car. Got decent at driving. Still feel hard done by to this day that I failed my first test. Missed it by one mark and feel tester was unfairly harsh.
 

 Anyway. I went back studying for two years, gave up job and failed driving test twice more in some desperate hope of a miracle that I could pass having not driven in a year or gone for lessons due to my financial situation and basically the whole shit show stopped for a few years due to covid and my having no money for anything.
 

 Skip forward to now - I have had 3 lessons with a new instructor. I had done a bit of driving in a car I have now (partner is qualified so I can drive with him) before getting these lessons, and thought hey it's all coming back this is great I'm gonna pass this test so fast now.
 

 And, well, nope. I make lots of mistakes and getting called out on them has made me overthink all of driving now and I am now terrified to sit into the car to go anywhere. I live on a busy road in a city. And I am after developing such anxiety around all this that it is getting totally in the way of progress. I feel like instructor is getting withered because feels I'm not practising enough. And I don't know how to convey how much dread driving gives me.
 

 Like I full on have crying fits, clenched jaw, tension headaches in the build up to having to drive. I absorb every mistake I make personally and find it so hard to just let it go and be patient.
 

 I'm 29 and feel this pressure to pass really soon and it is just hanging over me and I feel like I can't even imagine passing having had the experience of failing 3 times.
 

 When I'm on a main open road, or countryside roads, I feel fine but in around the city, there are so many hills and lanes and pokey roads constantly busy. I live in Ireland where it is illegal to drive alone on Learner permit too so I don't go practise as much as I should and despite people saying I should take down the L plates and go on my own, I am TERRIFIED if I tipped off someone or someone tipped off me, I'd be finished. Car can get impounded, insurance voided. I cannot afford it and I feel that I am so shaky and road so bendy, hilly and busy that clipping off a car could easily happen.
 

 Just don't know how to calm myself down. I've begun to take sertraline just this week because I'm generally a very anxious person. If it wasn't driving it would be something else I guess. But driving is becoming irrationally scary to me. I know it is not a normal or healthy level of nervousness, just sharing because it's hard to share this much detail with people IRL."
"Recently got diagnosed with anxiety and am taking a pretty low dose of Lexapro. I also have GERD (acid reflux x10) and a shingles-related eye disease, both that flare up occasionally when my body is experiencing higher amounts of anxiety. When I try to get my insurance info from my parents to treat these, they act shocked and alarmed by me having anxiety and sometimes delay giving me insurance info to hear what's going on. 
 

 I don't really want to explain myself and I really just want to address these symptoms which can get pretty serious if unaddressed. I'm tired as a Gen Z having to explain to Gen X-ers why I have anxiety, and why so many people my age do. I'm tired of my parents using my anxiety as a way to get information about my life out of me. Do you guys have any issues with your parents about anxiety? How do you go about addressing it?"
"Hey guys, another poll from me. Looking to see what people with SA typically feel when fearing social interactions. Please choose which one best describes you. 
 

 P.S. I’ve purposely left out some vague feelings such as “afraid of my opinions” since it doesn’t specify the root of the fear itself.
 

 Edit: wow did not think this would blow up. I wish I could reply to everyone but this has given me a lot of material to study. Thank you all for sharing.

I left my frozen burrito at work in front of the air vent in the fridge and I’m worried this will cause a fire. I’m home now and it’s hard to sleep because I’m worrying idk what to do
F28 - I've been traveling across my state for work for the last 8 years. In the past 6 months I've gotten panic attacks while driving and need to pull over. Used to be once every other month to now every single day. Today my 1 hr drive took 2.5 hr because I had to pull over 4 times. Last week my Husband had to come get me from the gas station 5 miles away because i was terrified to keep going. This came out of no where and I'm at the point I'm terrified before I even get into my pickup. I got into a life threatening accident 4 years ago (head on at 70mph) and was eager to get out of bed and be able to drive again with no problems. Idk if this is ptsd that just kicked in late or what's going on. I have an appointment for the end of next month with my Dr but i was hoping for tips or anything really because I love my job and need to be able to drive safely now before I end up causing a wreck. I don't drive unless I absolutely have to. I try to catch rides but it's not always possible.
"I have really poor work history. What I mean by that is job hopping a lot. I'm a 27F and I don't have a college degree. I can't afford to go to college.
 

 All the jobs I've worked at are entry level, odd jobs; 
 examples include:
 

 1 year at a Cold Stone Creamery (I had really bad anxiety when serving customer, my favorite part was making ice cream in the back);
 

 3 years at a local bakery (I enjoyed being a bakery assistant making pastries and frying donuts);
 

 6 months at a local sushi restaurant (back of the house making sushi);
 

 1 year tutoring math at a community college that i dropped out at,
 

 1 year at a Petco (hated the cashier part due to anxiety, enjoyed stocking shelves and cleaning animal cages);
 

 2 years at a local doggie day care (my favorite job, I had to quit because my mental health was deteoriating due to personal problems caused by the pandemic);
 

 and 
 3 months as a kennel technician at a local veterinary hospital (I also enjoyed this position).
 

 These jobs were held from 2012-2020 in HI.
 

 From 2021 - 2022, I lived and worked in WA, I convinced myself that my mental health would get better if I moved away from my home town where I felt triggered a lot. Moving did not help my mental health, my problems followed me. Plus I screwed up my resume even more.
 I worked at:
 

 an Amazon fulfillment center, 
 

 a local doggy day care, and 
 

 a local pet food manufacturer 
 

 each for 4 months.
 

 I leave jobs because I don't think maturely that job hopping looks really bad on a resume. I kept finding flaws in the employer, now I'm seeing that there will always be flaws in an employer and if I'm going to be a functioning adult I need job stability.
 

 I've applied to a bunch of no experience/entry level jobs, but I rarely get an interview. When I do get a request to interview I panic and not go because of anxiety. I know in the past I've always had difficulties with job interviews. Now that I'm remembering how difficult these are, I don't ever want to job hop again. I'm really bad at selling myself and now with gaps in my resume from job hopping, I feel even more scared of having to explain that to the interviewer. If they ask, what do I say? It's just not a good fit? I also don't have references I can use because I'd leave my previous employers on not to good terms.
 

 I'm thinking of trying out a temp agency to get work. Do you think they'll be able to get work for someone with terrible employment history as mine? Are the interviews with these agencies less formal? I know I'm capable of working hard and I'll stick with a company long term moving forward. I'd prefer hands on work and no customer facing positions.
 

 I don't mind factory/manufacture/assembling/warehouse/production type work."
"I'm 28m and I've always had trouble doing things without someone there to make me feel grounded. I don't take care of myself, I don't work, I don't study, I don't even do things I enjoy because I feel too disconnected and uncomfortable with life. I want to hide in my books and lay down in bed and feel safe instead. Anyone interested in keeping me company as I try to get things done today?"
"I am 25M and I was always a high achiever throughout my entire life. I got into a good school and got a great job out of college. During this time I have always dealt with high levels of anxiety but I could still function. Then, almost a year ago, I was sitting in front of my work computer and just couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t get myself to work on my tasks and ended up taking some time away from my company before eventually resigning. I got a new job hopeful that less stress would be helpful and it was bearable for a few months, but I am now in the same boat of having such high levels of anxiety that I can’t get myself to do my job properly and am currently on leave. I have so many feelings of self hatred and hopelessness because I didn’t used to be like this and I don’t know how to recover. I am not the type of person that “doesn’t want to work”. I have a psychiatrist and a therapist, I have done partial hospitalization, but nothing seems to be able to get me to a point where I’m able to do my job in a functional way. I am able to do other life tasks despite the challenges of the anxiety. I’m worried about my future. Has anybody else ever experienced something similar?"
"So, things happened to me.

"Yesterday I was going through Facebook after a long day of work and I saw alot of news about the increasing inflation happening in my country, our currency got devalued by 150% in just 7 years. I really worked hard to have a job in a one of the biggest tech companies in the world and I'm doing relatively good. But whatever I do, things get more expensive at a crazy rate and I can't buy anything and nothing has a financial value here anymore. 
 

 There was a car that I wanted to buy, I sadly excluded the idea because it got 80% increase in it's price!! and it's supposed to be economical car not fancy or anything.
 

 So, yesterday I saw a sponsored Ad for this car on my FB timeline.. 1 minute later I had a severe short of breath, crazy chest pain and mild migraine.. and i was slightly away from getting fainted. It lasted for couple of minutes and I tried to breathe .. it got better but the chest pain lasted for an hour till it's gone.
 

 I felt so stupid going through that because of an AD!! , but I realize that the economy is what's getting under my skin and I was projecting.
 

 I can't sleep now and I wanted to share with someone who can get what I'm saying. Thank you.."
"So I (F28) just got a new job about 3 weeks ago. It’s my first job in my dream field, Veterinary medicine. Everything was basically going great except due to my S.A.D (social anxiety disorder for those that don’t know) I’m having an extremely hard time making friends. I usually just work in silence &amp; don’t talk unless spoken to first. With the minor exception of like 2 sometimes 3 people. I haven’t told anyone this but it’s really weighing down on me so much. I’ve never felt so out of place, like an outsider. People would be talking then suddenly stop when I enter the room. When I try to make conversation I usually end up being awkward as heck &amp; could automatically feel the other person/people silently judging me. I’m much better once I get comfortable &amp; out of my shell but they don’t even seem to give me the chance. I haven’t always been affected this badly by my S.A.D. Prior to COVID I’ve been at a 5 or 6 depending on the situation. I’ve noticed post COVID my anxiety has been at a constant 10+ and being triggered by completely random stuff. I wanna make friends cause I feel so alone but it’s so hard. Idk what to do. I do play PS5 and switch but I still feel awkward asking someone to friend me online. I haven’t mentioned this to anyone, not even my bf or family. I’m embarrassed by this. Plus they’re so happy for me getting a new job, I don’t want to disappoint or worry them. 
 

 

 For the most part I’m just venting to try &amp; not overwhelm myself but it’ll also be cool to befriend someone who can relate but hates being this way. 
 

 ✨If anyone has any advice or anything to say I’ll gladly appreciate it.

"I started a new job a couple of months ago.
 Although I have some prior experience, there are lots of new things which I yet to fully grasp.
 So I still ask a lot of questions which makes me feel ashamed because of my lack of competences and common sense. The work and workload are quite intense. I tend to overanalyse and double check things because of that I am afraid I am not completing all the tasks on time. I am even afraid of being dismissed after my probation.
 What is worse, my current job is at the office. I have spent these two years working from home. Thus my social skills, which had been rather poor even after the pandemics started, are more than miserable. So now on a daily basis I experience multiple ""aaaaaah-my-mind-went-blank-i-am-so-dumb"" situations wherever I encounter nearly any social situation. During nearly social situation I have this annoying inner voice telling me how dumb/insignificant/annoying/etc I am. After nearly social situation I have ridiculiously long moments of overthinking and overanalysing any thing I said, or look I gave, etc. And I keep forgetting things I am supposed to know and make an idiot out of myself. 
 I am so tired of that. And I don't know what to do. I am 28 and it seems to never end...
 What is wrong with me?"
"I moved to US around 3 years ago from a country that has good public transit and where hiring drivers is affordable. When I moved to US, it was really difficult but currently I live in a place where public transit is good enough to go to nearby spots, for grocery runs, etc. I am 25 and always looked down upon or rely on someone when I had to travel to a different place. So, last month, I started learning to drive and was scared when I had to drive and would imagine things like other cars hitting me which would bring my confidence down but I didn’t give up. I was freaking nervous in the road test and almost wanted to give it up and go home rather than taking the test. I didn’t give up and passed my road test today. I have practiced almost 20hrs in the last 30 days and passed the road test. I was finding difficult to do the left and the right turn but practicing really helped me.
 

 I would like to tell you all not to give up and learn this life skill. Yes, you’ll be scared and I’m still scared sometimes. Pay a deaf ear if your instructor is tough on you. I understand that it brings your confidence down but either change your instructor or don’t really mind them."
"This is the craziest or most ironic thing I’ve written in a while.
 

 Lately, I have noticed that when I’m relaxing and my body is going into full relaxation, I feel anxious.
 

 It is so weird!!
 

 It is like my body is so used to being anxious 24/7 than when I’m not anxious. I feel ok for like 20-40 minutes maybe 1 hour.
 

 Then my mind is just like … where’s is all the noise from the non stopping thoughts coming to your mind about millions of things.
 

 Then at that moment, when I feel somehow relaxed and peaceful.
 

 Anxiety kicks in like saying, we need to be alert 24/7. It isn’t normal to be relaxed..
 

 

 I don’t know, it may seem ironic, but this is how I feel.
 

 Any one else with this feeling ? Has this happened to you, if yes, any tips? Advice ? Etc."

"EDIT: I made a huge and incomplete list of things that I love about her and deeply admire in her. Then I sent it to her. She took me back. Comparing this enormous list with my list of cons (lack if intellectual stimulation, not the type I'd typically go for), the cons seem ridiculous. What was I even thinking?! 
 

 I wasn't very interested in her before we started dating. She approached me first. She was there for me after my ex had broken up with me and I was going through a tough time. After a while, we entered a FWB relationship. After the first time having sex (I had panic before that first meeting) I was already conflicted. The sex was the best I've ever had. And I admired her for how courageous she was in approaching me and then initiating the entire FWB relationship. I admired her emotional intelligence. I loved talking to her about our emotions and felt that we understood each other. Still, I thought to myself: ""This is nice, but she's definitely not attractive and smart enough to be my girlfriend."" I'm an academic working an office job. She's a cook. I'm a brain person while she's a heart person. In my head, these were ""obvious"" incompatibilities. I realise how shallow I was being. Please don't judge me too harshly. I think these kinds of thoughts are also some form of defense mechanisms in case she leaves me (""I was too good for her anyway"") and I've had them in every relationship I've ever had. They are rooted in my insecurity. Until recently I was too immature and blind to see this defense mechanism for what it truly is. A defense mechanism. Nothing more. It may be part of me but it doesn't define who I am. I've got other parts, too. And I don't have to listen to it because its thoughts are not the truth. This feeling of superiority might come in handy in certain situations (e.g. carreer, presentations, exams) because it allows me to act in a very confident and anxiety-free manner. But it's not something that should be part of a relationship.
 

 Anyway, the FWB relationship went on for a year. It became exclusive really fast and basically was like a normal relationship, just without the label. After a year I had a crush on a colleague and told my FWB about it. She was very understanding but told me that if I wanted to pursue this crush we couldn't see each other anymore. I had a panic attack at the thought of losing her, so I decided to commit. We officially became a couple. But the doubts from the beginning of our relationship as FWBs were still there in the back of my mind. Lingering. Nagging.
 

 We had a wonderful time together (one year so far). Went on weekend trips and vacations. Spent lots of time together. Laughed a lot. Didn't have any big arguments. Treated each other with respect. Trusted each other. Felt safe, comfortable and understood in each others company. Missed each other when we were apart. I wanted her to be happy. And she wanted me to be happy. I loved how loving and caring she was not only towards me but towards everyone. She doesn't judge people like I do and I truly admire that in her. She'd be a wonderful mother. What I've got in my brain she's got ten times over in her heart.
 

 Yet, the doubts were there. Demanded to be heard. 
 

 Do I even love her? Am I simply acting in love? Faking it? Deceiving myself?
 

 If I do, is my love enough? What if I can't love her as much as she loves me?
 

 Doesn't an angel such as her deserve someone who can love her at least as much as she loves me? Someone who can love her unconditionally?
 

 Are we even compatible? Isn't intellectual compatibility super important? Haven't I always wanted a partner just like her but with the addition of intellectual stimulation on top? Is that an unrealistic expectation? Or am I settling?
 

 Am I wasting her and my time? 
 

 Am I scared of breaking up because I have never broken up with anyone? Because I don't want to hurt such a lovely person? Because I'm scared of being alone? Because I'm scared I won't find anyone who fits better?
 

 Should I have pursued the crush instead?
 

 What if these doubts don't go away and in 10 years I wake up next to her with the realisation that I've been living a lie? That I've been lying not only to myself but also to her? And now it's much more difficult to get out of it.
 

 What is love? Does true romantic love even exist or are my expectations simply unrealistic? Aren't people supposed to automatically feel love with the right partner? I feel like I'm forcing and deceiving myself to love her. She deserves better.
 

 I started having panic attacks. Thinking in circles. Thought that I needed to break up with her and that thought scared me. I didn't want to. But my fear and panic was screaming. Telling me to break up. Let her find someone who truly deserves her. So I eventually did. I caved in. Four days ago I broke up with her.
 

 I didn't eat. Laid on my couch for four days. Curtains drawn. Made an appointment with my therapist. Talked to friends. Thought about everything. Googled all my doubts. Stumpled upon the concept of relationship anxiety. Started wondering. Is she really not the right one for me or am I suffering from relationship anxiety? Isn't relationship anxiety just a form of self-deception? 
 

 Now I don't know what to do.
 

 Was I wrong to break up? Should I go back (and hope that she takes me back)?
 

 PS: I know I don't paint a very nice picture of myself here. I know I've got to work on myself. A lot.
 

 PPS: I also suffer from generalised anxiety disorder, am very introverted, have always been an overthinker and am taking an SSRI. Made the mistake of lowering the dosage of my SSRI two weeks ago before going back up five days ago."
"Hey everyone! I am 27. F. I have been diagnosed of Extreme Anxiety Disorder last May of this year. 
 

 I have been experiencing like a ride in a roller coaster. Ups and downs. Roof to bottom. That’s how i feel everyday. I am never normal. I sometimes feel like going crazy. My triggers are when going outside, going to a road trip, elevator, sometimes eating, going somewhere far from my house and many more. I am even surprised to discover more everyday. 
 

 I have tried many things to help myself get through it: Distract myself (Play SIMS4, Valorant (when i feel ok coz it gives me rush), some mobile app to help me get through the day (Breathe) (Youtube) and etc. 
 

 Now, how you guys have been dealing with severe anxiety? 
 

 Please help me :("
"My (27F) best friend (26F) in the entire world is getting married in October. Her bachelorette party is this weekend on Lake Travis near Austin Thursday-Sunday. 
 

 12 people total are going including her mom, future MIL, sisters, cousins and a few friends. I’ve met them all of course but I’m not super close to anyone but the bride. 
 

 I’m flying in from DC, most are flying in from Cincinnati. We’re all staying in our house together and have an itinerary that includes pool days and a yacht day. Otherwise we’ll be at the house. 
 

 I’m incredibly anxious. More than usual. 
 

 I’m reading my packing list and the itinerary over and over again.  
 

 Im anxious about possibly sharing a room/bed with someone and not having a “safe space” or time alone except in the bathroom. I’m anxious about meals and photos and outfits and my body. I’m anxious about being away from my routine. 
 

 My weekend routine is a sacred coping mechanism for me and my anxiety - I balance prep for the week ahead with exercise, rest and fun. 
 

 She’s my best friend and I want her the have the best weekend ever but I’m just anxious about being on someone else’s schedules and not being able to rest or be alone. 
 

 To answer questions I assume I’ll get: 
 - I can’t get a hotel nearby - the place is on a lake and we have a house in a community. I also don’t want to be a downer) 
 

 - I’ll try to make alone time - go on a walk, sit somewhere alone, etc as much as possible 
 

 Any advice? 
 I’m making myself anxious about being anxious 😂"
"Are there any anxiety medication that wouldn’t mess up with my mood? I have tried many SSRI and SNRI medications but they made me lose my feelings and I got depressed because everything felt grey and meaningless. After I stopped taking them my depression got cured. 
  
 I haven’t been using any anxiety medication (other than oxazepam and betablockers) for 1,5 years now but I feel like my anxiety is getting worse and I need medication."
"Hi everyone wonder if anyone can shed some light on my current mental state and help me understand what's going on. Perhaps you've experienced similar. 
 

 So lately I've been having a lot of anxieties and fears about everyday things. My predominant fear is that I develop anxiety with everyday things by being scared of that happening in the first place. Therefore causing a fixation and association of fear with simple things. Kind of like trying not to think of a pink elephant. 
 

 I also feel weird about life and existence. It overwhelms me sometimes &amp; I feel depressed because of it. It's almost like a hyper focus on every thing in everyday life. Things feel heavy because of this ultra awareness. 
 

 Just to give an example today I had to pee very badly &amp; I thought what if I develop a mental block with peeing by being hyper focused on it. I have a different fear everyday or the same ones reoccur. 
 

 A bit about my history: 
 I have had depression on and off since 16 nothing crazy or suicidal. I'm 28 now male. 
 

 I'm generally an anxious person especially when it comes to social anxiety. It's not really stopped me from living life mostly. I've managed it fairly well. 
 

 I have had an existential crisis and fears about existence a few years ago. I got over it though and was fine. 
 

 Can anyone help me understand what's going on? I just want to feel normal and not have these fears."
"I (F25) have struggled with anxiety and depression for over ten years. I've gone through a lot emotionally and mentally. My entire life just radically changed. I lost my fiancé, moved to three states within three months, finances are shot and I'm having a hard time finding any sense of normalcy. My panic attacks have been particularly bad the last five months or so. I can't always be my myself, I constantly need someone to tell me I'm okay and I always fixate on my heart and breathing. I wound up in the ER Friday night with the worst attack yet. I wholeheartedly thought I was going to die. My heart rate was fluctuating between 70-180 and I was experiencing uncontrollable twitching all throughout my body. My EKG, blood work and chest x-ray all came back normal so they discharged me after a few hours. More often than not they are triggered once I've smoked marijuana or drank alcohol but it doesn't happen every time. I've smoked since I was 19 to help me sleep and maintain an appetite but until I recently tried some stuff I believe was laced with something smoking has never been the same. I'm terrified all the time. I have a constant feeling of impending doom, like I'm never going to get out of this. This has been the most stressful time of my entire life and I need to know that it will get better, that I am okay and I will get through this. I'm so afraid of going through what I did the other night again but I do not know how to keep these thoughts at bay. My family is being very supportive and are looking for treatment options for me so I will be able to function. I take something for depression but not for anxiety. I don't want to keep feeling like this. I'm scared. Please someone tell me I'm going to be okay and this will not beat me."
"I know it's a silly fear and to be totally honest, I'm just looking for some reassurances, but I'm terrified I'll be alone forever. 
 

 I was never scared to be alone before I met my ex-gf but after falling in love and losing it, my heart and brain are just... off. And I just feel worse than ever because my family and I are on vacation and did family photos; everyone had a partner, had children except me. I was alone, like always. 
 

 I'm 28 and a lesbian, and while I know I have time, I also only ever seem to hear about other queer people finding love early on. I'm just scared I missed the boat."
"Hey guys , 26 F
 

  Last month I had a bad break up . I was so hurt and i cried a lot and all that . After some days i started getting indigestion issues and which lead to acidity . And i was not able eat junk food and not feeling hungry , feeling sick. I started worrying about my life and heart. I visited doctor they gave me antacids but it didn't do much . I get chest pain in spots and feel like something is stuck in throat . So i went to other doctor and they told me that i am taking stress and lots of anxiety.he gave me anxiety medicine for a 4-5 days and he told me I need to maintain my thoughts without medicines 
 

 Its been better after that but i still get chest pain in spots and sulking feeling and body ache . I get tired so fast.and i try to distract myself and not think about it . 
 

 Can anyone give me more tips on how to feel better . I really want to be healthy and have a good feeling and stop worrying about myself and dying."
"Hey guys I'm 25 old Male with health anxiety, just happened to check my blood pressure which showed 118/82 at first, and again I tried because I've never had my blood pressure above 110 before, so I was bit anxious so I tried it second time and showed 144/95 my heart palpitation was at peak. I was so much anxious. After calming for 3 mins, I tried again and showed 130/ 85. Is it normal guys? Did anxiety spike my blood pressure temporarily? Should I be worried?"
"Lately my days have been filled with nothing but anxiousness &amp; anxiety. It's getting so annoying for me I've never been more sick of myself in my life then I am right now.
 I just want it to get better, I wanna feel better.
 I pray constantly hoping one day God will heal me from all this fear.
 I'm 27f &amp; this is the first time in my life I've felt this terrible about myself &amp; lots of shit happened to me growing but this, this takes the cake on how I'm feeling.
 Maybe I'm feeling this way cause I've always held in so much? Idk but i hate it. Hoping one day it gets better for me &amp; people like me.. I could be around dozens of people &amp; not feel scared it's weird it's when I'm alone I feel scared &amp; worried.
 Well like I'm not completely alone I have a girlfriend but most times she thinks I'm faking it so I dont say anything I suffer alone most days I sometimes go to my friend who struggles with anxiety as well &amp; shes be helping me thru it alot I'm so thankful for her. I wish people understood this feeling.
 My first reddit probably many more to come.
 I like talking about how I'm feeling.
 Should I see a therapist? Probably but will I? Probably not.
 Seems like a struggle to find the right therapist now a days.. so fuck it.
 Yall be my therapists. 🤣
 If anybody has any tips or natural stuff to go about for anxiety let me know cause I refuse to take antidepressants man."
"I'm 26M and I've felt depressed for at least 5 years now, but I just took my first step and told my doc about it... 5 or 6 times. I still don't have the guts to go to the shrink. Now I feel anxiety coming up for 6 months now. I recently lost my job, again, and I'm scared of finding a new job... I feel dizzy just thinking about having an interview for an job. I canceled so many job interviews and I hate myself for doing it and start thinking of suicide just to end the suffering. More and more dark thoughts are getting into my head. I started shaking like never before because I had an interview the next day and my friend helped me get prepared for it. 
 

 Sry for my bad English, in German."
"I'm 28 and I'm supposed to be having one of top wisdom teeth extracted and or pulled tomorrow. I'm not sure of what they're going to do just yet since it's kind of an urgent thing that just needs to be done since the tooth I'm speaking of is currently infected and broken off near the gum line.
 

 I'm really hoping they can pull it so I don't have to be completely put under anesthesia, which is the part about all this that's making the most anxious. I have pretty bad hypochondria, most of which is triggered by things that make me feel like I'm not in control of my mind/body. I don't know if that makes any sense at all, but regardless, if anyone has any reassurance to give, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks! ❤️"

"I've been coming to reddit to help with my anxiety &amp; I must say it's been going pretty great knowing I dont suffer with this feeling alone cause with anxiety it sometimes feels like you're all alone in this situation. I read posts about others anxieties &amp; it gives me less stress. 
 Looking at peoples comments &amp; seeing them get tips makes me feel comfort.  
 I know one day it'll get better for me &amp; everybody else. I dont only pray for my anxiety but I pray for others like me. I wish nothing but the best for us ❤
 

 My to do list with my anxiety is to go running &amp; meditating. 
 Reading &amp; writing.
 Let go of some stress that's been built up in my mind for a long time. It keeps getting better each day.
 Also has anybody ever tried Lavender/Chamomile tea? I heard it helps. Or has anybody tried CBD oil? A lot of people recommended CBD or indica (I'm not a weed smoker) but there is obc oil 0thc lol. Definitely gonna be trying that soon."
Does anyone have recommendations for good podcasts about social anxiety?
"So I'm a 25m that has a good job, I have high hygiene(brush my teeth and shower every day), tanned, I'm pretty athletic (about 10 more pounds till my abbs come in completely.) I wouldn't say I have the best face but it's not bad in my opinion. I feel I'm a positive person most of the time. The only thing I struggle with is making friends (i have none), talking to people (especially girls), and being afraid to go anywhere. I've tried tinder and all those other ones. Of course, I get very few matches. Does anybody have any suggestions?"
"Ive had anxiety for like a bajillion years so this is no new rodeo for me.
 How ever i now have this really annoying feeling in my right arm. Its like sciatica but for your arm and its been there for 3 days. My fingers feel annoying like i just feel like its a dead arm. (I can use it and feel everything. I havent lost strength in it.) but now i have to consciously think about making sure it doesnt get flexed. And i feel like ive lost some dexterity in my fingers. 
 Ill feel it like pretty much lifted to my ear and i have to yank it back down.
 On top of that ive had this horribly tight feeling in the front of my throat which will crunch sometimes and tugs when i try and bring a bubble up through my eustachian tubes. WHICH in turn makes me swallow an absolute FUCK ton of air which gives me horrible gas pains. Im 12 months postpartum as my littlest one just turned a year old and we have also started weaning so its been hard for me mentally. My oldest started school again today and theres been alot on my plate. My legs hurt to friggin walk like i had to stop the other day bc it felt like my legs were gunna lock up on me. And then of course my digestion has been awful. Nauseous. No interest in food. Im just over it… im terrified i have a brain tumor, or ALS or some kind of stomach issue. Idk… help plz"
talking to people is something we all do every single day so why is it so hard for me? i feel like i don't know how to talk to anyone. i just don't know what to say. i started a new job almost a month ago now and i don't know how to talk to my coworkers. i say hi to everyone and introduce myself to new people but aside from hey how are you and like the basic get to know you questions i just don't know what to talk about. i don't know how to just strike up a conversation or chat when nothing's going on. like for example if i'm in the break room at work and another coworker is also in the room. i talk if someone talks to me but i usually just pull out my phone because i don't know what to say. i want to make friends and be friends with my coworkers. i also just started school this week as well and i want to make friends but i don't know how and it just feels impossible. i wasn't working and isolated myself for more than 4 months before this because i became really depressed after a bad break up so it's weird getting used to being around people who aren't family again. i just feel like there's something fundamentally wrong with me.
"Hey guys, if any of you are interested in my TLDR version of the downfall of my mental health, feel free to check out my previous posts on my page. If not, here's the quick version:
 

 I'm diagnosed with major depression and pretty severe panic disorder. I was started on 10 mg Lexapro since I was 19 and stopped when I was 21. Lexapro felt like a sugar pill for me, it didn't do much. When I first took it, the first day my head felt really tight like a balloon, but the next day I felt 0 side effects and haven't felt any side effects since. I'm 25 now and have been going through medication therapy. My psychiatrist has had me on Atenolol 25 mg for the past 3 weeks now and while it has worked miracles for the physical symptoms of my panic attacks, it hasn't done much about my racing thoughts and suicidal ideation. I feel so dizzy and lightheaded all the time, i'm dissociating more often, i run out of hope most days, and truthfully, I feel like I need something to balance me out a bit.
 

 My doctor put me on Zoloft 25 mg for a week and then increasing it to 50, and eventually 100. He's having me take this along with my atenolol, but the thing I'm worried about is the fact that I have 3 12-hour shifts this week and I start school in 2 weeks. I've heard terrifying stories about people's experiences the first 1-6 weeks of taking this medication, and I truly can't afford to be debilitated with school and work. Do you guys think since Lexapro didn't really have an effect on me that it may be the same with Zoloft? Maybe atenolol will help with the side effects?
 

 God I'm terrified. Someone please reassure me :("
"Hey everyone, I found this thread and wanted to contribute as Anxiety has been a huge part of my life ever since I was a teen and wanted to share my short story.
 

 As a background, I’m a 26M male , has a good job, independent and have a great support system from family and friends. 
 

 I’ve always had anxiety in terms of overreacting to situations, such as general health anxiety and other situations that I can blatantly make up or exaggerate in my head to worry me. These occurrences seem to be extreme to the point where I let it consume my daily life. I’ll research constantly outcomes and different experiences so I can relate but I find it so unique to me that no one would understand.
 

 Personally, I don’t see myself as a doom and gloom guy because I have battled and conquered other health conditions in the past with dedication and positivity, but for some reason (possibly striving for perfection), I feel moments of worry that can last for hours and even days at a time.
 

 

 I may not be able to cure anxiety and fear, but I want to be able to accept all feelings and allow nature to play its course. Everyone will experience anxiety to some degree but for us who have to conquer this demon on a daily basis , we have to remember that we have our own talents and releases that can help us cope and not let it take over our lives. 
 

 

 Thanks for letting me express myself"
"Hi all, 28F , I really need some advice because tonight i have bad anxiety because friday i have to go to my dad's brithday and he will have a medium party with his friends and i don't wanna go.... I just wanna chill with my hubby home not at a party with fake people ... Any advice on how to manage this situation? Thanks in advance"
"Self reflection for the past years have made me (M27) realize I’ve been living with intense anxiety my whole life and had become used to it as how life is. I didn’t know it was anxiety, it was normal thinking and normal life for me. I have made progress in the past few years of managing the anxiety and the other day I had my first “clear thought.” It was a thought, but with 0 worry or anxiety feeling attached to it. It felt like a purely logical thought with no tight emotional grip attached to it.
 

  I don’t want to jump to conclusions but it felt like that’s the “normal” way of thinking. The best word I can use is clear. It was simply a clear thought. Has anyone experienced clear thoughts more and more? I imagine with healing comes more of this clear thinking and it was really nice. 
 

 Also I’m new here. I’ve had heavy anxiety my entire life that manifests physically as well. Y’all are not alone. Anxiety is life altering and extremely challenging. We stand together and live a good life with the challenges we face. 
 

 Clarity! Lets get some more of that!"
Hi so 27F here with anxiety and ptsd. Does anyone else just constantly battle themselves between what to say and what to keep to yourself? Like “am I being crazy or over emotional” or “are my emotions valid and should I risk ruining this person’s day”? But when I choose to speak up I always feel so much better but it’s at the expense of someone else. If this isn’t specific enough please let’s start a discussion in the comments because I am driving myself insane lol
"I find that my anxiety spikes whenever I have to leave home, as I get scared that something bad might happen. 
 

 

 Before it's time to sleep, I find my heart races and I start to get afraid to sleep. It's tough to relax, I think, and I guess it's because I might be experiencing some existential stuff. My therapist mentioned that before.  
 

 

 How do you break this anxiety feedback loop? The lack of proper sleep has made me feel tired at times, and I think physical symptoms like the tiredness and nausea kind of make my brain feel convinced that there is a legitimate danger? 
 

 

 I was reminded that I just got a checkup not too long ago, and that there was nothing serious found. But, I still find myself scared to sleep. I want to continue to enjoy life, and I guess the fact that death is a part of life that's out of our control is what terrifies me. 
 

 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Also, I avoid the news if I can because of all the stories about young and/or healthy people passing away... that makes my anxiety flare up a lot. :( I'm in my twenties but a lot of those stories are about people around my age group or slightly older. 
 

 

 Any advice?"
"So when my anxiety is high i get REALLY weird sleep sensations. Itll always be like im awake mentally sorta but my body is dead. (Sleep paralysis i believe) 
 Sometimes ill be half asleep and my whole body feels like its vibrating. Or my arm skin will feel like its burning. It goes away once i wake up. And it never happens when im not in fight or flight mode. This nap i took i was half asleep again and my whole head was pulsing. It didnt hurt it wasnt painful. It was just a HARD pulse all over my head and neck and back. 
 Does anyone else experience this kind of thing??"
"So a long while back I was prescribed propranolol twice a day by my doctor for anxiety. I didn't end up taking it daily, just as needed. Now I hardly ever take it, not for any particular reason other than I don't like taking meds unless I absolutely have to. But the thing is, I also get migraines fairly often and one of the treatments people can take for it is daily beta blockers. My dad also gets migraines and takes a twice daily beta blocker that lowers his blood pressure as a migraine preventative. He thinks that a lot of my issues are related to migraines and migraine auras, like his were, and that if I took the same thing he takes it'd make a lot of my problems go away. I'm not 100% in agreement with that but I do wonder if it'd help both the migraines and anxiety.
 

 I'm just a little concerned about taking something like that daily. I'm only 25 so hopefully I still got a long life ahead of me, that's a long time to be taking a medication. I know if you take beta blockers your body grows accustomed to it. You have to ween yourself off if you ever want to stop. I guess what I'm asking is, for those of you who take daily beta blockers, have you had any issues with it? Either obtaining the medication, costs, your body's reactions to it long term, and anything else you might have experienced with it that you think would be good to keep in mind. Did it help your anxiety? Did you eventually ween off of it once you got better? Did you stay better or have to get back on it?
 

 Any advice and thoughts are appreciated! :)"
It makes me so anxious thinking how anxious I would be and how much that anxiety would hurt me mentally. It also makes me very sad to see how much I’m missing on in life because of my extreme anxiety.

"I've begun taking 50mg Sertraline tablets and I am one week in. I took half pills all week. Today was first whole one.
 

 I understand it is normal for symptoms to get worse before improving so I've basically been curled up on my bed with my teeth clenched all week not talking to anyone.
 

 I had a drink tonight even though alcohol I know makes this worse. I find that I do lots of things that don't help. I am getting in my own way of living a healthier more fulfilling life. I find it near impossible to have fun and relax. I'm either serious and doing something because it's productive or I'm down/anxious.
 

 Anyway just sharing because I feel low. S/o is gone on a trip since yesterday until next Monday so it's just me and my cat.
 

 Find it hard to reach out to friends when I feel like this."
"TW - Cancer, medical issues, hospitals, panic attacks, claustrophobia 
 

 I'm going to try my best to explain everything that I am currently feeling, and I'm hoping somebody feels the same and can help me out because school starts again in a week and I'm not sure if I will be able to succeed like this. 
 

 For some background, I (25m) had never had a panic attack before the age of 20. In the summer of that year I came down with extremely severe Vertigo which caused me to lose most of my vision, as well as my ability to function on my own for about 2 months. I had to get multiple brain scans in MRI machines which terrified me and still scare me to this day.
 

 At this point in my life, I was a pretty heavy weed smoker as well, and after I had recovered from vertigo, weed started giving me pretty incapacitating panic attacks. So I quit smoking, but the panic attacks stuck around. They got a bit better over the course of the next couple years and I hadn't had one in a long time up until recently. 
 

 In June of this year, my dad was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. He doesn't smoke, eats healthy and exercises, and was probably in better health than me. While his prognosis is amazing and he will more than likely pull through, he is in extreme ammounts of pain, and has been in and out of the hospital for treatment and different complications. 
 

 About a month after his initial diagnosis, I had my first panic attack in a long time. And then another one the next day, and now I have been having almost daily panic attacks surrounded by a constant state of anxiety. The first few weeks I was convinced all the stress was going to give me a heart attack, and I ended up getting myself into the hospital with chest pain to get my heart checked out. My heart is healthy and my blood pressure is only slightly above normal. 
 

 After I got checked out, I had about a week and a half of releif with little to no symptoms of anxiety. This past weekend however I went on a vacation and ever since i returned, the panic attacks have been back in full swing. I am no longer concerned about my heart, but now I seem to be clinging to some diet related anxiety. I get scared I am either going into anaphylactic shock (I have a severe peanut allergy) even if I cook my own food and know exactly what's in it, or I am convinced I am falling into a diabetic attack. I have no history of diabetes, but It does run in my family. 
 

 I can give more details if requested, but does anybody know how to deal with health anxiety? Specifically around food? I know I was completely fine eating around a different city and drinking alcohol while on my trip, but now that I'm home and back in my safe regular routine I am convinced somethings wrong :/. 
 

 Currently I am surviving through: 
 Daily meditation / mindfulness exercises 
 Visits to a social worker offered through the cancer centre here in town 
 1mg of Ativan as needed for when my panic attacks get out of control 
 

 Thanks for reading and In advance for any help offered! Apologies for formatting as I am on mobile. 
 

 TLDR; Ever since my dad got diagnosed with cancer, I have been having frequent health related panic attacks. Most are revolving around food. Any advice would be appreciated!"
"I feel like my motivation is so fickle. One minute I'm like ""that sounds fun, maybe I should try it"" and the next I feel like ""nah, don't feel like it rn, maybe later"". It's frustrating. I don't do much at all. I know I'm bored with what I normally do but I just can't seem to find the motivation nor energy to do other things. Especially if it requires me to make decisions and has a decent learning curve. Some days are worse than others. Sometimes all it takes is for me to push through that initial feeling but other days I just can't be bothered. 
 

 I imagine some of it might be a symptom of mild depression maybe mixed with a little bit of anxiety and loneliness. Some activities are more off limits than others because it'd ramp up my anxiety. But others I think I just lack enthusiasm or motivation. Hate feeling like this."
"Hey everyone , lifelong anxiety sufferer here.
 

 Even though I’ll probably have anxiety to some extent for the rest of my life , it’s been tremendously better compared to how I was when I was in my teens, even a year ago. I’ve also been a victim to various pharmaceutical drugs that have made me experience anxiety along with other terrible side effects .
 

 I’ve referred a couple people on this thread to this specific program/protocol already and willing to assist more. PM me for more details .
 

 DISCLAIMER: I am not a doctor , nor will this protocol be an overnight fix. It requires dedication and potential lifestyle overhaul on your part, but the reward at the end is so much greater"
"25F with 90% of my life with anxiety/ocd. Never in my life have I liked myself. Can't even put makeup on correctly, teeth arent a good white, can't grow hair, wigs are terrible, nice wigs are way out of budget, terrible fashion choices, overheats in 60 degrees, money scares me, people scare me. I scare me.
 

 Social anxiety has gotten better but still no true friends besides 2 people (1 is a family member) I regret not making friends in high school or college. I tried but failed. Moved to a new city and 3 years later have been friendly with my SO only. People say I'm really nice but no one ever wants to hangout or even do something simple as getting ice cream. I go to events and can never muster enough courage to talk to strangers because of how shitty I look.
 

 Wasted 80k in college loans. Got a masters in library science and my old job never gave me the raise they promised. Changed jobs to something that doesnt require a masters. Regret getting a masters and getting that extra debt. I currently make 38k a year even after getting a masters. My parents must be so proud of how much I've failed already. Parents don't understand my anxiety and I can never bring it up because then they yell at me and remind me I'm not homeless or going hungry. 
 

 I hate how anxious I get and it is ruining my life. Tried prescriptions and therapy that didnt help. Had to take about a 7 year therapy pause because of insurance. Don't see how I could ever afford it while I'm paying my debts off for the next 50 years.
 

 I am terrified of ever having kids because I will worry about everything and we all know I will never be able to afford it.
 

 Literally cannot stand myself and it is clear many people cannot stand me either. 
 

 So many life regrets and I will probably have 50 more years of regrets. I can't wait. I'm hoping I drop dead of a heart attack soon. Thanks to anyone who got this far."
"I met this girl at the pub I work at, things led to another and we ended up going to a rave with a friend, now we are drunk
 And she invites us to her place. My friend leaves and we stay alone but I don't make any moves thinking I don't want us to regret anything since she could be a friend (we like the same stuff) we go to sleep and I hardly slept since Its not everyday i sleep next to a girl.
 Next day she's super dry on text and all I can get out of her is that I'm cringe. Now I'm afraid i'll never be able to make a connection with someone because of this.
 Also i'm 25 and still a virgin."
"I (27F) passed my driving exam in late March and haven't touch the wheel until July, when I inherited my grandmother's old car (VW Lupo from 1999) now that she is a nursing home.
 I practiced with that car two times, 20 minutes each time.
 

 The first time went good. I drove around my neighborhood, got used to the heavy clutch pedal, practiced going a street that is a bit uphill and only let the car go down once I was about to go home, while I was parking in reverse. It wasn't bad.
 

 The second time was also just on my neighborhood but I let the car go down in the middle of the street and I panicked. It took me a lot of tries to put the car moving. Lucky that I only practiced when there were not much transit so no one showed up.
 

 Now it has been 2 months since I touched the wheel. 3 weeks ago I had a medical appointment and had to ask my mom to drive me there. I feel ashamed.
 

 How to let go of the fear?"
"Fill ya in, 29m who struggles with Drug addiction, Social anxiety, Paranoid personality disorder, and suicidal tendencies. And I want nothing more than to no longer exist because I feel I'm always just going to be stuck like a fucking unemployed ,drug addicted who is so far down on himself I won't take the first step to fixing my problem. And the worst part is I have a great life. I have a a great support network of family, friends and I have semi accessible mental Healthcare and I know I'm better than this. I've been sober before and made it just fine. I was happy and thriving not just surviving. And I have lots to live for, I have a son who needs a dad, I have friends who need my comic relief so they dont end up in this boat, and a lot of people to prove wrong.. But yet I Still find myself finding any excuse to stay stuck. I let people I know aren't my friends use me and lie to me and genuinely kick me when I'm already down. I don't eat, I have bad posture, I chain smoke. I am a fucking mess and like. Fuck."

"I'm (27F) very nervous about driving on major highways. I didn't drive a car for the first time until I was 21, due to anxiety, and got my license when I was 24. Now I'm good with side/back roads, and smaller highways/highways that aren't major. I live in NJ and the drivers on the road can be crazy. I still take ubers once in a while and don't miss the days when I used to uber all the time, and still feel like I need to take trains to places an hour or over away. I'm tired of it. I've driven on major highways a few times before and I thought I was going to die any second. I've started to get into meditation, not daily, but working on it. Maybe this can help with my fear? I have to look at Google Maps and look at the roads/directions from the driver's POV sometimes to see what I'd be getting myself into. I just did this for a train station over a half hour away from where I live because I'm thinking of making this drive, and it's on a major highway. My heart was pounding just looking at it on the fucking computer!
 

 Will I ever beat this?! I'm terrified and so disheartened because I live in a pretty isolated area and I want to go out more and do fun things with my family and friends that live in other parts of the state. And of course, I'd like to drive beyond the state too, to other states. I feel like I can beat this fear but it's going to take time and I'm feeling so impatient. I feel like a prisoner in my own mind and it gets to the point of feeling suicidal sometimes. I want so badly to beat this fear but my anxiety controls me and my life and it makes me feel like I'm going to get in a fatal car accident. I hate living like this and meditation might not be enough."
"Hi I’m 26m and I’ve always been pretty heartless and distant with everyone in my life family, friends and in romance. 
 Always keep stuff bottled up and deal with everything myself don’t want to bother anyone I know with my life or my problems. 
 

 Always been talking to women and messing around with them but never opened up to anyone and avoided relationships due to mum being an abusive one when I was younger, her one with my dad not working &amp; everyone I’ve known always having issues and drama with their S.O.
 

 Few months ago met a really amazing girl who made me fall for her right away, love every little detail about her and things are great but since being with her there’s been a tightness in my chest and I’ve felt really anxious about the whole thing don’t know how to combat the issue it happens as soon as I’m not with her, but I’m not a clingy person and understand everyone has a life, is there any tips to help with this feeling? I understand I’m being selfish but I don’t know how to sort it."

"Everyone around me asked when will I finally get my license since I turned 18 and it was annoying. I've always been to scared to drive a car but several months ago I got determined to sign up for a driving school. I learned the theorethical test answers really well and I actually felt like I can do this. Little did I know that this was the absolutely easiest part.
 I recently started driving in traffic with my instructor. She had her bar pretty low because I sucked at the training ground with parking but my first drive in the outskirts was fine. Today it was a bit more difficult and I did terribly.
 I feel terribly anxious and I have tears in my eyes every time I think about driving. I wish I could just quit but it was very expensive so I might as well try... I mean I try my best, but apparently it's not enough. :("
So he’s never really been supportive of my anxiety and has always just told me to think positive thoughts to make it go away. I told him it doesn’t work like that. Lately it’s been bad because I’m stressed we have a toddler who I am a stay at home mom with and he’s always been a terrible sleeper and I’ve always been the one to get up with him so yes I’m tired which makes my anxiety worse. I’ve been getting help though and doing better but I had a panic attack yesterday and he told me he didn’t want to get married anymore because I might have a panic attack and embarrass him in front of his family and friends. He also said if he had known my anxiety was this bad he would’ve never had a kid with me. I hate this stupid disease 😭😭😭
"Idk why but I've always been like this.
 

 Now that I'm 25 though I've come to realize that it might become a problem.
 

 I have social anxiety disorder and just speaking to people in general is always a challenge. I've gotten better over the years socially speaking.
 

 Where my concern lies is with work related anxiety.
 

 I have a really hard time sharing my ideas.
 

 Group projects in college were always a massive challenge for me.
 

 For example, if my group had to come up with a fake company for a marketing class, I would be way too afraid to share any of my ideas and just wait for another student to present an idea. I have this fear of judgement and that my ideas are never good.
 

 And then what if we do choose my idea and it ends up being a terrible decision and it's all my fault?
 

 Its exhausting always worrying about silly stuff like this but I do and I'm worried that I'll take it with me into my professional life.
 

 I'm practicing to become a developer(web, software) and I've really enjoyed it, but working in a team sounds terrifying to me. I know I'm going to have to do it though to be successful. In any field really.
 

 It recently dawned on me that life is just a bunch of group projects. I am freaking out haha."
"I’m sure many here can relate when I say that I really struggle to talk to people, which is pretty crucial to forming friendships. I think it might be worth practicing here where we can all understand what it’s like to have social anxiety, and be less judgmental about being awkward or struggling to be entertaining etc.
 

 If anyone wants to try this, let me know. I’m a 25M in the U.S. It is a little late, so I may fall asleep by the time anyone reaches out to me, but we can set up a time in the future to try to call. Per the title, my preferred platform would be Discord, since I don’t have Snapchat or whatever my fellow Zoomers are using nowadays. 
 

 Let’s support each other!"
You ever fuck up anything potentially positive and happy before it even had a chance to start? Over thinking shit into existences and killing my own vibe Is going to be my downfall.
"Hi there people of Reddit! Thanks for reading. I (F27) have been diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder (GAD). No biggie, I always figured as I overthink everything. It has recently been brought to my attention that I do not have any real friends outside of my boyfriend (M27). Typically this is not a problem, as I get very anxious during social interactions, but my bf insists that I need other people to talk to. He feels that I am always bothered by the fact that he is having conversations with his other friends and also has access to other people when he needs to vent. He’s also stated that it can be overwhelming when I need to vent as he is my only outlet. Overall, this has become a strain on our relationship. I can see his point of view, however I don’t really know how to make friends. It’s very hard for me to step out of my comfort zone and reach out to others. All help is appreciated."
"Hello everyone. So TMI last night I got sick. I'm very sensitive to my stomach so for me throwing up is very anxiety inducing. I also tend to work very hard at my fast paced online college so I'm anxious about getting my work done as well. I emailed my professors but I'm still nervous. My whole family and I got the flu or covid 2 weeks ago ( my parents tested not me, I just had some mild cold symptoms ). I was fine last week but I started coughing again yesterday then got sick. Luckily I haven't had a fever at all and we are all vaccinated. Sorry for the long post. I just feel overwhelmed and anxious."
Realizing that he didn’t care about it was an eye opener for me because I’ll always have love for him and I’ll drop anything but seeing it doesn’t matter anymore. I have no choice but to let it go. I wish him nothing but the best and I’ll always be here if anything. That’s something he’ll never know.
"Hello 
 

 I'm 28m overdosed at 18 woke up with panic attacks next day, a week later i was diagnosed with Gad. Most of you know the process. Over the years different meds. Seeing the odd person for a few sessions. Anyways i got promoted at work last year and i now manage the shop/staff. I have lost 2 stone and my anxiety/depression gotten pretty bad especially the depression.i saw my gp a few months ago and he said its not bad enough to see a professional and that i should refer myself through a service to get a few sessions. So i spoke to a lady in this service and she said my childhood troubles are pretty bad and its still bothering me so i need to see my psychiatrist. So i went back last week after not seeing him for a while and he says i have been struggling with anxiety for a few years now he thinks im on the spectrum of autism. If i needed help communicating there is a support group for autism i can go to. Urm hello i manage a shop with staff.
 I left feeling pretty shit tbh after talking to my friends and family they are saying no chance im autistic. Sorry for the long story i just wanted you to get a picture of thing's. My question is will i always be felling shitty and down and tired all the time?
 

 I get my job takes alot out of me but i am good at it i was only hoping to see someone to discuss my meds or like the woman said work on some childhood things now i dont know i have also been single for 10 years my anxiety triggers that something fishy going on there but as you know unless i slit my wrists nobody gives a shit to help
 

 Thanks"
(26F) I've been getting really bad anxiety spells right when I wake up in the morning. Does anyone else experience this/know why this is? I wake up with racing thoughts and tightness immediately and I have to talk myself down before I can even get out of bed. I don't feel relaxed until lunch time and it's really making it hard to focus in class and just enjoy my life. Any help will be appreciated! &lt;3
"I was good for almost a week and now I'm having an anxiety attack.
 I just want it to be all better already I thought I was recovering from it but then like you probably cant recover right? Theres just some good/bad days &amp; we just gotta accept life like this now? 
 Music, podcasts, cartoons help.
 I think the heat triggered it cause it be hella hot today 🥵
 Hopefully I feel better after we come back from swimming.
 This is like my own personal notebook but with people who understand what I'm going thru."
I have a crush on a guy at work and I am not one for being involved in anything with another person. I am trying incredibly hard to get over this crush but it's not working. He's always in my head and I go into panic whenever he is near and try to avoid him at all costs. I need to constantly listen to music to try and calm myself down or to stop being anxious and have even started exhibiting restless leg. Crying helps for sometime but I am not able to concentrate on anything at all(movies/hobbies/exercise/reading - not working). Even though I don't have any contact with him on social media but this has started affecting my alone time as well. Anyone has any bright ideas to cope with this? (Total avoidance at place of work is not feasible and definitely not confessing to him)
I cannot sleep as I may have stomach cancer. I have had ulcers and problems before and read that the bacteria for ulcers can increase the risk of stomach cancer. I am reading stories online of people who had stomach cancer and some have died and I’m crying so much. My doctor doesn’t take me seriously and I have no idea what to do to get this looked into as the pain is gnawing.
"Hello everyone !
 

 This is my first post. Unfortunately I don't speak English very well (I am French speaking) and I use google translation.
 

 Normally, I rarely express myself on the networks but I have reached a critical stage...
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 I introduce myself:
 

 My name is Eric, I am 27 years old and I am Hyper-sensitive. My relationship to anxiety is a bit peculiar. In my youth I suffered a lot of crises with physical symptoms in addition. I managed to work on myself all these years and now it's not too much of a problem. But when I go through a strong emotional trauma, all my symptoms come back and that's the case now...
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 There are two subjects that make me feel bad, very bad. I'm not going to go into details (that's not the subject) and keep it simple, but I'll put it in context:
 

 July/August: I had a terrible health problem on which I struggle a lot psychologically. This problem exhausted me mentally and physically. However, the fact that the doctors have diagnosed the problem, it relieves me enormously because I know why now I suffer from severe sleep disorder for all these years! Unfortunately there is no miracle solution for the moment...
 

 The other problem: it's a very complex story but I have just lost a very dear friend to me, really. To be more precise, she decided to end our friendship last week... I'm completely devastated, it's a tragedy (because these are very important things to me...). In the story, she made mistakes, I made mistakes. I think this situation is temporary, I sincerely hope so. I respect his choice even if I don't agree or even angry.
 

 I think I have said everything about the context.
 

 with my health problems, I was already badly on the verge of collapsing. Since my friend decided to cut ties, it's been ""the straw that broke the camel's back"" (French expression). I completely cracked, tripped, I couldn't react as I usually did, in short: I'm in emotional distress and I have anxiety attacks...
 

 Since Wednesday of last week:
 

 I haven't slept for more than 72 hours.
 

 I can no longer eat (I force myself though).
 

 I can't drink anymore (I force myself too).
 

 every time I eat or drink I vomit (so much so that I have some bleeding).
 

 I have a lump in my chest that is very disturbing, it stings and it hurts.
 

 I had almost quit smoking, I picked up a lot (I'm ashamed of it).
 

 I cry systematically, a lot and very regularly.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 All these symptoms were so violent that I became unwell (lost consciousness) on Saturday around 5 a.m., I woke up in the hospital -&gt; one of my roommates found me unconscious on the ground, fortunately he was there.
 

 A very close friend of mine saw my distress and decided to take an unannounced ""holiday"" by the sea from Sunday to Tuesday. it did me a lot of good but my anxiety and my emotional pain are still there but it allowed me to take a ""parenthesis"" on all that. I got home yesterday, and it's starting again... All my symptoms are back...
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 What could I do?
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 I am completely devastated, lost...
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Thanks for taking the time to read this post!"
"I was misdiagnosed with ASD and it just, ruined everything. 
 

 Everyone on my mom's side of the family has a clinical anxiety disorder. So, of course, when I was a kid no one considered that and they decided a kid with no language delays or really notable symptoms other than having a hard time making friends. 
 

 For years they didn't say anything, and things were, fine-ish. Let's of nerves and little social interaction, but some. Then came middle school. 
 

 So, I do 100% even have a clinical anxiety diagnosis, now. I have a hard time imagining a situation more suited to push it to 11 than being dropped into a school where I knew no one, months after being told (poorly and falsely) that I has ASD, forced into special education despite begging not to be. 
 

 And that just, rolled for years. No one cared, no one bothered to listen. Everyone just blamed everything on ASD. They even got me to that point.
 

 At a certain point I was just too paranoid, insecure, and depressed to, function. But still, no one cared. No one ever even asked why, they just assumed they had the answer and nothing I could say was relevant. 
 

 I'm 26 now, and finally managed to get my head straight. I'm actually, fortunately, fairly capable of managing my anxiety at this point now that I can accurately understand it for what it is and not believe it's entirely justified because I have a disability that I have no symptoms of.
 

 It just, I missed so much. And it's so hard to recover after so many years. 
 

 I have a hard time not hating my family for what they did."
"I (f26) have these long periods of time, especially at night, where nothing feels like it'll ever be ok ever again. I just feel an overwhelming sense of dread and impending doom of isolation (from abandonment, death, illness, poverty...etc). I feel like I can't see myself in my space. I don't feel like I belong at home or out in the world. I cry at the smallest things and I have noticed a tendency for being a hypochondriac becoming more present in me as I get older.
 

 Then it'll be like 10am on a Tuesday and randomly I'll get clarity and it's like I don't even know why I was so afraid. I sip my coffee, listen to music, kiss my partner and then boom I feel like I've come far, even...I Just feel so here and there. And when something minor happens like a doctors appointment gets cancelled or I know I have to budget for an event, it goes right out the door. Zero to 100...It's like the world is ending and These pointless stressors are between me and myself...
 

 Recently I've been back and forth on finding a new job. I have terrible social anxiety and also really bad financial anxiety since I've started paying student loans. I feel like I'm on a thin rope and one mis-step and my whole life will topple over...which it could. If I don't have income I lose everything. My credit, my place, my life. I turn 26 in December and I don't even know how I'm going to afford insurance once I get kicked off my parents. I'm underpaid. The thought of interviewing anywhere terrifies me and also I don't have a license so my options are super limited. I cannot even afford a car anyway...but I can't drive because it terrifies me.
 

 Birth control fucked up my whole body...now I'm too scared to try and get on anxiety meds. I'm just not ready, plus losing my insurance soon makes me nervous to get dependent on anything like that. I'm just exhausted. I'm using a few days of PTO to take a week to myself, organize and clean my apartment, have slow days, go on walks, and just have a pause to catch my breath. I'm debating making a rule that I can't think about serious life stuff over this break, but a part of me thinks I should be reflecting too. I'm trying to avoid burn-out but also figure some things out. I want to be a better partner, daughter, sister...friend. I had to cut off a manipulative friend and I have had to start over in that department...the isolation hasn't helped really. It's nice not to compare myself but I feel like I have no one to talk to. I can't put everything on my partner all the time. I feel like a gum ball machine just rattling around inside. I get so physically sick from worry."
"Idk if it's just something that I've experienced but I feel like most of the people who wonder why I sometimes get offended from ""jokes"" or am sensitive to degrading comments never really had to go through what I did just based on the fact that they weren't awkward enough to be a target of bullying in the first place.
 

 I'm already an adult and if I explained this to another adult they'd probably laugh at my face and tell me to man up."
"I'm in a really bad period of depression and have 0 energy to cook anything that requires too much stuff and particularly cook things that causes alot of dishes. I also lack appetite which makes it even harder. 
 

 Any suggestions that at least have some nutritional value?"
"Hey y’all! 28(F)
 For the past year I’ve been on a concoction of Buspar,Celexa, and Hydroxazine for my CPTSD,OCD, and GAD. 
 I was getting horrific akathisia so I took myself off of buspar about a week ago (with the guidance of my psychiatrist)
 

 Here’s my question, since coming off of it I’m actually getting my sex drive back and enjoying sex again. Here’s the problem though, google is over here saying buspar actually HELPS with libido…? I’m confused. Has anyone had a similar experience?"
"I sometimes get stuck in an agonizing loop where I feel like a big baby because so many people have such a hard life and here I am worrying about talking to strangers and people looking at me, then I feel even more pathetic for having these feelings in the first place. Then it just loops back into feeling shameful for being such a coward."
"I take propranolol 2x a day and lorazepam as needed for anxiety, particularly nighttime anxiety. Do any of y'all have experience taking Olly's Goodbye Stress gummies? I've heard good things about them."
"I’m 26f and my old high-school acquaintance (I wouldn’t say friends) who is the same age as me will be working at the same company as me. 
 

 I’m dreading it because it’s been 10 years since I left high school. (I’m from the uk, we leave at 16) And, basically I had a very bad childhood, lived in a bad area and because of that I’ve always been quiet and reserved. So, I didn’t really have any friends in high school, and was sort of the loner type, and I was fine with that. That didn’t stop me from being bullied though.
 

 This girl in particular didn’t bully me, but she was not a very nice person. And would cause drama constantly. My friend from work rang me about the new colleague and I instantly knew who she was when she mentioned her name and now I’m dreading going into work. 
 

 I’ve built a lot of confidence in my work place, and get along with most of my colleagues. I’m not too quiet, but I do speak up and have learnt to stick up for myself. I feel like I’ve grown a lot since my high school days. And I’m not as reserved as I used to be.  
 

 However, this can all come crumbling down if she comes. I’ve heard already from a colleague that she’s loud, and acts like she already knows what she’s doing. 
 

 I feel like her mentioning to people what I used to be like in high school, and the fact that I was bullied will ruin what I’ve built in myself, and I’ll end up going back to being more reserved and anxious, and unable to defend myself. 
 

 I’ve tried my best to never bump into anyone from high school, because it was the worst time of my life, and I hate the reminders. And now I’ll have that reminder everyday until I choose to hand in my notice and get a different job.
 

 What should I do?"
Add me
"Over these past 2 years I've spent almost all my time on my phone or pcs. And over these 2 years my anxiety has come back. Just earlier today I was maybe 100 ft from my cabin to visit my grandparents house next door and I needed to go back after 10-15 min because of anxiety. I've had a bad panic attack last week so I'm kinda still in a bad place. I get nervous and anxious when I'm not on my phone or pc and IDK if I can sleep without my phone. This past week has been mostly focusing on games while the aftermath of this last attack slowly tapers off. 3d games take away the dizziness I commonly feel with anxiety.
 

 I'm worried about being too deponent to even leave the house. Last time I went into town I had a huge panic attack, and that was months ago. I live in the middle of nowhere and I don't know how I'm gonna get out of this."
"Hi, I (28M) am probably suffering from some anxiety and personality disorders. 1,5 years ago I was diagnosed by psychiatrist as unknown kind of personality disorders (nothing precise), since then I'm taking meds - now it's sertraline 200mg and pregabalin 150mg. Lately, I've read a lot about GAD and frankly, just too many symptoms fit to me. There are days when I literally lose my mind, just focusing on negative thoughts, doubt in myself and so on. In fact, for quite a few months I feel like burden to everybody, feel worse than anyone, and don't see any value in myself.
 

 Currently I'm living in one-room, small apartment with my partner (26F) in our hometown. We are together for almost 12 years, she's my first and only gf. We moved back from capital city due to her mother's disease. Sadly, the mother passed away earlier this year, we were together by her side until the end. My gf was her only child and she was also divorced, so in fact my gf right now are all alone without any close family. I know and understand that this is very traumatic and cant be compared to anything. I try to support her as much as I can, but there are some times when I simply cant feel any good with myself, therefore I get trouble to help her.
 

 Lately, there are a lot of days and situations when I feel completely overwhelmed by her problems, anxiety issues and sadness, I'm doing my best (I think so) helping her. She comes back to better mental state relatively quickly whereas I'm staying with all this shit stucked in my head and feel tired and constantly stressed. When I feel down, anxious, non-present or angry she usually can't understand me and disregard my mental issues. Another thing is we have different energy levels, I feel so insecure that I'm afraid that my behaviour and my mood is slowing her down as she is more energetic and want to do a lot of things. Sometimes when I come back from working 2 days in the office in different city, she is super relaxed and confident, but her mood is changing as soon as I cross the door. She told me a few times that she was upset that I was tired and went to sleep early.
 

 Due to my insecurity and anxiety I suddenly blame myself for her worse mood. Sometimes when I communicate my feelings and issues, she gets angry and yells at me that always my problems are more important than hers. It's like she can't be supportive for me and I feel injustice because I really try to support her a lot. 
 

 One more thing: due to meds I have lately almost zero sex drive, which makes whole situation much worse and complicated, as she is very sexual person and needs a lot of sex attention. I feel not enough, guilty and simply hiding my emotions even deeper inside myself. 
 

 Not sure if I need some advice, more like I need some sort of validation that it will pass and it's gonna be okay and this actually is okay, hmm dunno :(("
"Trigger warning: health anxiety, death
 

 Tldr; health anxiety has been really really bad this year. I'm just so incredibly stressed out, I can't function at the moment. Just really need a hug / support. And if you know any reasources for dealing with the concept of death, let me know.
 

 

 I am struggling so hard this year and it has gotten so bad. I've had health anxiety / OCD since I was a kid, I'm 25 now. But wow has this year been terrible.
 

 In the beginning of the year a neighborhood dog had jumped on me - so of course, I'm afraid of rabies for the next month. Go to multiple urgent cares, waste time and money. Ugh.
 

 Then, I start having GI issues. Oh shit (literally!), What if it's bowel cancer?? My mom is a retired doctor and reassured me that I was fine, but that didn't help. I went to a GI specialist, and that didn't help. Finally I end up getting a colonoscopy and finally that put my bowel cancer fear to rest. 
 

 I worried about rabies again a few times. Worried about various cancers. Went to urgent cares, doctors, all said not to worry.
 

 Then I got a routine blood test done, and found out I have really high cholesterol and elevated liver enzymes. Now, the enzymes are due to meds likely. But the high cholesterol is familial. But damn, having actual abnormal labs is scary for me.
 

 Then, a really bad thing happened to me that caused me to face my own mortality. I can't go into details as to what happened, because I'm not supposed to talk about it. But needless to say, I've been obsessed with my own death for like two months now. It's been a real struggle and it's making my health anxiety and OCD go into over drive.
 

 Now I've been worried about oral cancer for the past week, and it's all I can focus on. I had a canker sore from stress, so of course I think it's cancer. It took several weeks to heal, which is longer than usual, which is why I'm worried about it being cancer. It is healing though, and the white patch on it has gone away, it's just a little swollen now. Of course, last night I was picking at the spot where it was and I caused some bleeding, which has sent me into even more panic. I haven't gone to work in several days. My mom (retired doc) says she thinks it's fine and not cancer but it's so hard for me to trust that for some reason.
 

 I'm not looking for reassurance for my latest scare, because I know reassurance doesn't help in the long run. I am in therapy, and I've been on meds for many many years at this point. 
 

 I guess I'm just looking for a virtual hug, some support, some cheerleading so to speak. Because it's getting to the point where I am so sick of riding these waves of panic and terror.
 

 Also, I've started to realize that at the root cause of my health anxiety is a major fear of death. Is there anyone else here like that? Has anyone here found any good resources, philosophy, etc that has helped them reconcile with the concept of dying? I wasn't raised with any sort of religion, but my mom's side is Jewish so I've been considering looking into that, maybe that would help. Or spirituality of some kind? Idk.
 

 Thanks for reading this. I hope that someday we'll all be in a better place mentally."
"For reference I’m 28m. 
 

 In late 2019/ early 2020 my sister was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Apparently my grandma had 2 sisters who also had some type of schizophrenia.
 

 I started smoking weed during my sophomore year of college (2014/2015) and over time it became a daily habit. I’ve been trying to kick the habit but honestly it’s been a struggle to stop completely. I’ve decided to quit again and I’m doing my best to abstain forever. I also used LSD and shrooms in college. 
 

 I have a huge anxiety about waking up one day with voices in my head, delusional, paranoid etc.
 

 Has anyone had a similar history? I know the chances of developing schizo are about 10% if you have a sibling with it, but the chances go up with the drug history I have… if I could go back I would never touch any of these substances"
"i’ve (26f) had anxiety for as long as i can remember. the earliest memory i have is when my mom would drop me off at nursery school when i was probably 3 and i would panic/cry and worry that she was never coming back, even though she always did. she’s told me i had awful separation anxiety as an infant (wouldn’t let other people hold me, wouldn’t let a babysitter keep me, etc). after that, i was deathly afraid of dogs until i was about 8, then developed severe emetophobia so my parents took me to a therapist. got over the fear of someone throwing up, but then experienced homesickness when i would spend the night with friends sometimes. tried summer camp and hated it bc i missed home so much. then in 8th grade i began having anxiety related to my public middle school classmates physically fighting at school, so my parents told me i could transfer to a private school. one day my mom told me we were going to meet with someone from the school i wanted to transfer to and instead took me to a therapist. this is the only somewhat significant “traumatic” memory that comes to mind - being deceived by my parents, and obviously this is mild. after that, anxiety subsided for a bit, then resurfaced in college with severe depression so i got on anti depressants for the first time. been on medication + seeing a therapist pretty consistently ever since. my parents had a normal and healthy marriage. we are an upper middle class family and i was always given more than i needed. i don’t have any specific or vivid memories of any “textbook” trauma (no abuse, neglect, etc). but, now that i am an adult, i feel like there is just no way i was just born like this. 
 

 did anyone else grow up in what they thought was a “normal” and “healthy” home, then later realized something that was totally normalized was actually traumatic? i don’t mean that like you thought your creepy uncle hitting on you was normal until you grew up, i mean something subtle that i may not realize caused trauma was actually traumatizing. any time i try to dig deep in my memory, i don’t have any memories of ANYTHING other than a normal childhood. zero suspicion of any kind of trauma. can anyone relate? how do i come to terms with the fact that i was just born this way (i guess)?"
"So I (26f) have been struggling with anxiety since I was around 13, maybe longer. There's one aspect to it that I didn't realize was my anxiety. I thought it was completely normal and that it's a constant thought for others as well. This thought was that I am always one step away from losing everything. My job, my home, my belongings, everything. And that I will never be able to recover.
 

 This is where my mind goes first and foremost whenever something bad happens. Hell, whenever anything can even lead to something bad happening. It doesn't even need to be something I've done, it can just be someone I've known for five minutes because those five minutes can lead to me getting in big trouble somehow. I don't know how but it can happen and then myself and my fiance will lose everything and it'll be my fault- I'm spiraling, I'm sorry.
 

 To be honest, I feel very little about losing everything in terms of myself. Here lately, outside of stress and anxiety, I feel next to nothing. What scares me the most and causes this thought process to be so scary is that I'll bring my fiance down with me. That I won't be able to protect and provide for him. That he trusted me by moving to my state and I'll let him down and being unable to make sure he's okay. So I try to make sure everything stays fixed all the time and try to hide my stress.
 

 Apparently I haven't been doing a very good job. We had an argument and he told me that my these thoughts, these assumptions that everything is so close to ruin are making him question the relationship. That they're putting him under strain and it's made him question us before. This is the first I'm hearing of this and it's the opposite of what I wanted.
 

 To be honest, I thought most people live this way. I thought almost everyone who doesn't have a well paying job views their lives this way. I didn't realize it was abnormal or unhealthy at all until tonight. I am so stressed my body feels sick. My stomach is cramping and I feel nauseated. How can I cope with this? How can I change this? Has anyone else dealt with thoughts like these?"
"Edit: GEEPERZ post blew up. Thanks for all your shares. It's amazing to see that despite us having anxiety, we try to better ourselves each and every day. May you all be blessed anxiety family lol

"Hi guys
 I (f25) moved with my partner (m22) to another country a week ago. We moved to a really cool kite surfing town that his dad lived in, but his pops passed away a few years ago in this very town. So, it’s a huge honor to be here. I’m meeting all his old family friends and new people too. It’s great to meet people so loving, vitamin D, see new biomes and such. However, I find myself feeling so so nervous under the surface. 
 

 We live with our boss whose actually just a family friend/ best friend of my partners pops. Our boss is like a superhero for the town. He will help you out in any situation you’re in, even if he barely knows you. His girlfriend is so caring and intrapersonal. My partner is so down to do anything and experience everything. The other people who work with us are adventurous and funny and kind. Overall, everyone’s kind. However, over the past few years, I have felt pinned down by my social anxiety.
 

 Even though everyone is so chill, I still often end up shying away. I’m upstairs in my room writing this while the crew is downstairs chilling, smoking, eating together. I spend most nights crying up here. Lost in thoughts. Feeling small and grey. Feeling like I don’t fit in or have anything to give. When the anxiety kicks in, I trick myself into believing I’m the size of an ant. My brain switches perspectives on me a lot when I get triggered. And it’s really easy for me to plummet into a murky head space, especially when it’s something so raw like moving to another country. 
 I have many ideas like wanting to paint or go on walks. I have wants for myself like a healthy life, wanting to be a dog mom, taking care of my community. I just trudge in these heavy ass boots and can’t seem to untie my laces. 
 In a few minutes, I’ll have to muster up the strength to go down there because I can’t just lay in bed a million lifetimes. One day I will find a safety in just existing."
"I keep stressing I'm VERY sensitive to medication and get strange reactions from it. Is half a 25 milligrams a small enough dose for the amount of caution I want with zoloft? I brought up a quarter of this amount but they said I wouldn't feel anything, I'm not really convinced since I know how ridicules my low tolerance is.
 

 Any advice? Experience?"
"I was told that a side effect of zoloft ""(what my doctor recommends) can have more anxiety as a side effect? IDK if I can handle that even for a few weeks (and feels like I couldn't handle it for a second when anxious). Are there options without anxiety as a risk? I've always had very strong and strange reactions to medication."
"Throughout this bad week of anxiety I have had a VERY bad feeling of loneliness. I live on my parents property and don't speak with people outside my family. But I don't usually feel like this, IDK if I ever felt lonely like this before. I also keep replaying thoughts of having to go to a mental ward or other terrible things. Running two things at once, like playing a game and having something else in the background kinda helps.
 

 Does anybody else have simpler experiences?"
"My therapist is always asking why I'm anxious. Before IDK if I really had reasons why I would become anxious except weed and exorcise. Sometimes I do now, but IDK if those are mostly things that I become anxious about after the fact.
 

 Is there always a reason you get an anxious episode? Really just seems random sometimes."
Can anyone else relate?
27M here and If I ever even managed to be in a relationship with someone I don't think it would work out unless that person had or has SA too... I feel like it wouldn't work out because she would never understand what it's like. IDK... Maybe I'm being self-centered here...
"I’ve (26F) struggled with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember and it has really affected aspects of my life (school, career, love, family, friendships). It’s currently affecting my relationship with a partner that takes good care of me. I’m filled with intrusive and anxious thoughts in my daily life that I need to listen to music all the time to silence it, would go for walks or play something in the background because I could not stand the silence. Being in a quiet environment just allows for the thoughts to get louder. I used to self-harm, take cannabis and hallucinogens to cope but I stopped doing that and focused on therapy. Today, I woke up heavy and this happens a lot and I’m just so exhausted…"
"I am 28 years old, female, fairly normal and healthy. Just like any middle class adult I have a full time job that I hate, a family that I love (most of the time), I go to school full time (online), have survived various traumas and my biggest problem is I can’t seem to relax. I am always on edge even when I feel like everything is going good, my brain is looking for some trouble and a way to feel anxious. I have endometriosis and PCOS I do not know if that conspires against me and adds fuel to the fire. 
 

 How can I be normal again?"
"Hi everyone, I (29F) have no friends and I haven't had any for about 5 years. That one friend I did have was a coworker who moved away. On top of that, my family is nearly all deceased (except for some cousins who I'm not close to). The only social interactions I have are from my bf and his family and the people at my current job. Still, even at work, I mostly eat at my desk and even though I've known my bf and his family for 10 years, I still don't say much around them, I mostly listen.
 

 I'm writing this bc my bf is currently on a trip and I'm home alone and realize I have no one to talk to or hang out with. I know it's my own fault because I don't put myself in social situations or if I do, I'm quiet because I never know what to say or I don't speak loud enough, etc. Anyways, how do you all deal with the loneliness?"
"I have too much business stress and too much anxiety that I won't be able to run it properly. I am 25 now , Started my company 3 years back but I think it's very difficult for my mental and physical health. With all the stress I am eating too much and also using too much screen. pls help it's getting worse everyday"
"I'm getting super angry and upset whenever I watch a show when something messed up happens, and I can't really let go of what I saw very easily now. I can tell myself its fiction or that's even if it wasn't there would be no point being so angry, but it doesn't mater and I still stay upset.
 

 Has anyone else gone through this? Feeling anxius right now after getting upset about a show."
"Hi all, 
 

 I suffer mostly from social Anxiety and depression caused by this anxiety. 
 

 A part from therapy and also trying out different medication (ones I tried have had too many side effects) I have also been looking at my diet. 
 

 The situation is that I never drink coffee or smoke, I only drink soda/sugary drinks, alchohol and eat junk food like once a month or even less. 
 

 I exercise almost every day, maybe a bit less some weeks. 
 

 I sleep usually 7-8 hours every night. I have no trouble with sleeping. 
 

 The only ONE thing i found in my diet that might be different from other people is the fact that I have been drinking 1 liter of 1.5 % fat dairy milk almost evey day for the past 4 years. I do this because of issues with being under weight. The extra 15 kg I have slowly put on by drinking milk has really been good for my body and overall I look more healthy now. 
 

 So, could the ""large"" consumption of milk be causing some of the issues i have ? 
 

 Off course I will try and quit drinking the milk for some time to see but I just wanted to hear of anyone has experince with this ? 
 

 Thank you all"

"Depression ADHD intrusive thoughts. I'm 27 
 I have all of this. Today I've been down. Due to a lot of chang happening in my life and my brain saying I'd be better off dead. Or I'm a shitty awful person because my chosen family is asking me to leave. 
 

 I'm moving back in withy blood family. I'm full of anxiety and depression knowing all that I've built in my current city will be gone. I've always been fairly nomadic due to tragedy in my life and I just want it to stop. I want to settle down and feels safe."
"I’ve come such a long ways from SA. I used to analyze every potential social interaction and wonder what words to say at every instance. The thought of talking to someone I’m unfamiliar with gave me terror. There was no way I could talk to someone I didn’t know and strike a conversation. I would always be quiet because the flow of conversation was too fast for me to interject. When I did talk, my brain did not connect my thoughts fast enough for me to speak so I would either get lost in thought or stutter even though I don’t have a stutter.
 

 I couldn’t ask people questions for fear of asking something too personal. I would avoid certain people because I was afraid of them wanting to start a conversation. There were so many things I was afraid of but I challenged my fears. I was tired of being afraid so I worked to mitigate my fears. It wasn’t magical, things didn’t automatically work. I had my awkward moments, my mishaps, stutters, incoherent sentences. Things get better. Improvement doesn’t happen over night, I spent many hours researching social anxiety, social awkwardness, meditation, deep routed insecurity, the power of letting go, social skills, self affirmations, and trauma. The tools I learned I tried to apply irl by way of social experiments. 
 

 I had to confirm that what I learned was a reality, I had to learn that I as a person have value and can be a positive influence on someone else. The things that people do occasionally to make me comfortable are things that I can do too. It all comes down to trying. The more you try the better it gets but the first few times you try, it feels like an existential crisis. Mouth quivering, heart pounding non stop, legs shaking, brain short circuiting, and a rainbow of emotions that literally made me feel like I was bipolar for a period of time. It also made my libido very low for a period of time as well. All these things are painful to go through but what’s worse, temporary pain or a lifetime of anxiety and loneliness? I had to choose temporary pain, so please guys, I know it’s not easy but it’s possible."
I am 28 and just went on my first date ever. I went on a coffee date with someone I met through a dating app. It was incredibly awkward. She just moved to the city where I live a couple months ago but has already visited more places in the area than I have. I had no idea what to talk about. I had done it to try to push myself but I kinda regret going now because I just feel hopeless. I have never had a girlfriend or even kissed a girl and barely have any friends. It is already hard to meet people but with social anxiety it feels impossible. At this point how am I supposed meet people or develop social skills? I feel like I am too far gone and should just give up socially instead of trying to force something I clearly am not good at.
"I (27f) just got reddit and this is my first post. The last few weeks have been really difficult; my anxiety has been through the roof. I get nervous thinking about work responsibilities and attending meetings. Really, anywhere I'm in a group setting. But there's something I noticed in the past few weeks that I've honestly experienced a good portion of my life, and I'm curious if anyone can relate.
 

 So my anxiety, both physical and mental, will come and go in waves. I'll literally be sitting there and a wave of feeling anxious, tense, rapid heartbeat, and intense worrying about whatever in particular will come out of nowhere. That will last a few minutes and then a wave of peace of mind and body will come out of nowhere for again a few minutes. Then the pattern repeats. For instance, I was washing the dishes and this dread of a future work project came about. Lasted 3 minutes, then I felt at ease while thinking about the same project. Then, that intense anxiety came back. This pattern can last anywhere from 20 minutes to a few days. And it's getting difficult to manage. Deep breathing and meditation doesn't help. The only things that help are praying to God and Xanax, but I take that rarely and only when it gets really bad. 
 

 I have a doctor appointment coming up where I'm going to explain this pattern. I'm not looking for any diagnoses. I just want to know if anyone has experienced something similar, because I'm feeling really alone."
"Last week I had a bad attack and have been trying to recover (And I have). But the other night I had kind of a nasty anxiety episode that has been lingering and flaring up over the past 2 days. It was after I watched something in a show that made me unreasonably upset, and I couldn't stop thinking about it until becoming an anxiety episode. Now I've noticed almost anything negative immediately sends me into a zone where I have to calm myself down.
 

 I've been having continues anger over politics and my past for some time now, but not like this. Does anybody have simpler experience or ways of coping?"
"Basically I'm dealing with constant stomach pain, no matter what I eat, or what I drink. I've been under tons of stress this year with a very, very bad diet. And now I'm dealing with this.. it's more an annoyance rather than pain. And I'm severely constipated.
 Never any blood in stool or anything like that. What Im wondering right now is, should I be worried about pencil thin stool? Not every stool I pass is like this. And it's not all the time. Like right now I went to the bathroom and there was a normal looking stool, good shape, good color, good length and all... And right after, really thin, pencil like stool that stuck to the bowl... Is this due to constipation?
 Are there any cancer red flags?
 I'm scared but I don't know what to do, I can't go to a doctor and can't get any tests done, I'm broke and uninsured.
 I'm 28 with no family history of any cancer,.but my diet has always been bad. Never liked fruits nor vegetables, and these past 2 years specially, diet has been terrible, and stress has been constantly hight"
"Hi everyone,
 

 I'm 28 F and i'm in the middle of a health anxiety episode i'd might call it .... what triggered it was a rash that i got overnight and didn't think much about it because over time i had rashes , 2 days after the rash because it didn't go away i messaged my doctor and send pics ,she told me that is probably urticaria and it will go away in a few days ,she gave me some tratment and i was good to go . in 2 days the rash got away and left a spot on my
 skin , the doctor said that is normal and is healing great but the problem is that i gave in and googled and i found all sorts off things like :skin cancer , lymphoma that starts with a rash .... and i was fully panicked , and i messaged again my doctor ,told her what i've seen on google and she reassured me that isn't cancer and that i should wait a couple of days till my spot goes away . Now in total is been a week since i had the rash and the spot is still there but it doesn't itch or burn ,is simply a spot .... a spot that don't give me pace , at night i go to bed positive that tomorrow it will go away and in the morning is still there and i'm scared and i don't know what to do anymore..... i'm very scared , in my mind a see flashbacks with those articles and pics on google with skin cancer ... physically i'm very scared to go to the hospital, i have nausea at the thought that i might go to the hospital to investigate that spot ... 
 I don't know how to enjoy my life with the spot on my leg ! Every second i'm scared that is skin cancer although the doctor said is NOT. 
 Have you deal with health anxiety? And how to do you got the strength to enjoy your life ?"
"I’ve been going through a crippling phase of GAD, panic disorder and health anxiety for the past few months and I felt like the last 2 weeks especially, I’ve made some improvements (sleeping back at home, less panic attacks etc etc). I really did have moments in the day where I felt like the “old” me again and was happy to be getting there.
 

 However the last week or so I’ve been having extreme hunger, maybe from the amount of weight I’ve lost through this flare up? But the last couple of days, I’ve been having heart palpitations, chest pains, general “nervous feeling” in my chest which lasts for hours and effects my sleep. I did my blood pressure when feeling like this and it came up with irregular rhythm and the results were all over the place (high) compared to my norm which is 120/70.
 

 I’ve had my heart checked right at the start of this episode, bloods, ECG, chest X-ray and nothing. I haven’t even been worried about my heart but now I am. 
 

 Has anyone else had feelings like this? Physical anxiety is the worst"
"So I (28M) have been texting over OkCupid to this one women (26F), and we even have a date scheduled for Thursday. So far everything's perfect, we text a lot, have a lot of shared interests, she told me already that she finds me really likeable and is looking forward to our meeting, we've also shared with each other that we're both going to therapy, so basically everything's fine and I could - in theory - just be looking happily forward to our date on Thursday.
 

 But unfortunately my anxiety has something to say about that as well. Instead I'm super nervous, and, which is really bothering me - despite me knowing that it is nothing to be afraid of - is the fact that she is still making changes to her online dating app profile, and obviously texting with others, given the fact how often she is online and not answering me back.
 

 I know that a) this is nothing of my business and b) that it is totally normal for people on dating apps, and therefore nothing to be afraid of. Still, it's bothering me, probably because of my low self-esteem concerning dating in general - I've never had a relationship in my whole life, and therefore kind of already expect this here to fail too, therefore it fits my view perfectly that she is already looking for potentially better matches online besides me.
 

 Do you have any tips on how to change my mindset until Thursday to be not super stressed out about this whole thing? My next therapy session is unfortunately on Friday, so no chance in asking my therapists beforehand what to do."
"Hi, group. I would like to share my experience with anxiety. I had my first attack this past Wednesday, I started to loose my mind, couldn't connect thoughts, suddenly fear came in, fear of not being able to think again, my heart started to race, after, I had trouble breathing, am I having a heart attack? I thought I was gonna die. I ended up in the ER, Dr. Performed an X-Ray to my chest and everything came out good, blood and urine tests as well, he also told me that I had an anxiety attack. Following days have been weird, I feel zoned out, like my body doesn't belong to me, distracted, I worry about every small detail in my body, depressed because I keep asking myself, why this is happening to me?, super tired and hungry, lots of crying for no reason, fear of going blind, weird thoughts I can't control while trying to sleep. Sweating while trying to sleep or after I woke up. Sometimes I feel like I am gonna have another anxiety attack but I try to control myself and it goes away, fear of having MS even when the doctor said it wasn't so my body creates or thinks it has symptoms. 
 

 Has anyone else experienced this? 
 

 

 I have an appointment with a neurologist just to make sure everything is okay."
"I’ve been battling a flare up of crippling GAD and panic disorder for the past 4 months in which I’ve been on a rollercoaster of success and relapses. I felt like I was really getting better the last couple of weeks but the last 3 days I’ve gone back so many steps.
 

 My question is, starting Sertraline. How bad really is it? I’m most worried about GI side effects, specifically Nausea (which sends me into panic) and vomiting. But also ED as a male/lack of sexual interest. And worrying about coming off it!
 

 I’ve been prescribed 50mg but thought about starting at 25mg. But can’t bring myself to start it."

"I'm not sure how long I can deal with this anymore. It's almost constant. There's always pain someone, even if not sharp or agonizing. As soon as I drink even a little bit of water, I feel incredibly full for hours to come. I feel bloated, tight... What's going on?? Stress has been off the charts these past 2 years, but this has started about a month ago. At first I had sharp pains and felt bad on the right side. Now it's basically the whole stomach area. I feel like I'm constipated. I'm struggling in that area a bit, but still . What's going on? I've heard so much: gallbladder, pancreas, ibs, GERD... But my mind goes to fucking cancer, obviously, wether stomach, colon or esophageal... I can't even cry anymore. There's never blood on my stool, or weird colors, and I never vomit. But I feel constantly full, and if I don't, I just feel a knot in my upper mid abdomen.. .can all this be caused by stress? By being tense? I can't deal with this anymore and can't go to a doctor!!"
"I've only been on 6 dates at my age. 2 girls actually initiated them. None of these led to anything else. 
 

 In high school and college, I was very anxious and somewhat socially awkward, with ADHD. But I managed to start and build a coed sports team. Ironically we had several couples come out of this. 
 

 Now I'm 26 and in the working world. I do poorly on dating apps. Before I started using them, I used to tell myself I'm ugly and weird. Now that I've been off and on them for 2 years, I'm wondering if this is actually the case?
 

 How can I put myself in the top 10% of guys who do well with women? I have a great career, hobbies, I have my own place... but it's not enough. And I'm afraid to take action, in public, and ask a girl for her number. If given an opportunity (she's waking a dog that reminds me of mine back home, I ask her a question at the grocery store), maybe I'll get a conversation going. But then I want to eject!!!
 

 Take a look at my pictures in my profile."
"So sometimes before I exercise I feel sick, almost maybe the anxiety from worrying about getting my heart rate up? 
 

 Then when I lift weights, I almost constantly have to Bob around between sets, not sure if I'm just trying to distract myself from thinking about my heart or what?"
"So I've known this girl (29F) I'm (30M) since we were in school. We have a bit of an on off relationship. Things would go good (we click on another level. When things are good they are really good) then she would either dissapear or we'd argue due to communication issues.
 

 I've found out she's got Anxiety, social anxiety, PTSD and OCD. It took her a while to communicate everything with me (starting this year) and explain why she keeps dissapearing. But she says it's not personal and she really likes me but gets so anxious. We fell out back in Febuary but have started talking again.
 

 I myself do have a few trust issues with her mainly due to her dissapearing a lot in the past. We're currently talking and she can take days to reply which can sometimes be frustrating but I guess I need to learn not to take it personally.
 

 Has anyone got any advice? I sometimes feel bad if I text her then I worry about her after not hearing for 2 days and text again and she eventually replies saying sorry and promises to call and reply later/tomorrow. But the day can go by and no call. Then she will pop up out the blue. It's just very confusing.
 

 Is this normal for someone with social anxiety?"
"Me26 him25. Like we talk all day. We talk on the phone, send pics, he gives me attention. But why do I get so anxious the times he doesn’t answer. We’re also in a group chat with me and him and my two best friends who are a couple (30m &amp; 26f). And sometimes he won’t answer my direct messages but he’ll answer the group chat. Why do I get so anxious? Why can’t I just leave him alone and let him not have to answer me 24/7. But the anxiety and overthinking when I get in a relationship is so overwhelming😭"
"I read on https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-8876/buspirone-oral/details that it has a rare side effect of: *Rarely, patients taking buspirone may develop movement disorders such as shakiness (tremors), muscle stiffness, mask-like facial expression, jerky walking movements, or a condition known as tardive dyskinesia. In some cases, these conditions may be permanent.* How worried do you think I should be of this side effect, and have any of you experienced this with this drug? I'll obviously ask my doctor about this before I start taking it, just wondering your experience with this drug. Thanks!"
"Hi everyone, 
 

 First of all, I do actually have a psychiatrist that I am speaking to at the moment, and he only said i have a ""recurring anxiety issue"", so I know people on Reddit cannot diagnose me. 
 

 But now I think I can finally say that I assume I suffer from SAD, but would love some input from you all.  
 

 And I just have such a hard time accepting the fact that everything point to the direction of me having social Anxiety... I feel it is such a marginalization and I feel social interactions is pretty much need everywhere in this mordern Day and age. 
 

 Anyway, so I read this today in an article about the new drug BCN210: 
 

 ""Social Anxiety Disorder is a serious anxiety disorder characterized by the persistent, intense fear of social or performance-related situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others."" 
 

 https://www.bionomics.com.au/pipeline/bnc210/
 

 And it all just clicked... since I was 18 I have had a huge fear of performing (I played live music since age 16) or speaking in front of people etc. - to the point where it can cause me to be tense in my body and not present in my mind, for hours before the event and the whole evening sometimes. 
 

 I walk around and always feel I have to socially ""perform"" in one way or another. As if someone would judge my way of acting, talking, walking etc. 
 

 Further more I judge myself a lot, I have a poor self image (I dont like seeing myself on pictures, despite the fact I look very decent). I also beat myself up for mistakes, dont feel good enough (sometimes because of SAD), I have a hard setting boundaries etc. - I hate the fact that my personality changed so much since age 20 (I am 28 now). 
 

 I dont want to go into too much details, since it would be a even longer post, but I really started having trouble around age 20 and then even worse the last 3 years, since age 25. I had a bit of a life crisis from age 24-26, which has affected my mood a lot. 
 

 I study to be a teacher and I do think it is a bit too much exposure 😵‍💫😂 It is super uncomfortable for me. Luckily I can do a masters degree and end in something less socially stressful. 
 

 I have been on the path of treating it for a long time, trying exposure therapy, talk therapy and even SSRI/SNRI's. But the only thing that ever helped was one SNRI, which I stopped due to hair loss and low libido. I even still suffer from low libido, so I do fear some of the side effects could be permanent. Dont really know what treatments could help.... 
 

 With all this said, not socializing is also not the answer, I found out doing the pandemic lockdowns. Isolation is very bad for me mentally. 
 

 Anyway, thank you for reading and replying !"
"Has anyone been having the same problem? My diet is identical and in some ways better than it was before my anxiety reared it’s head again. Yet I’ve lost 12lb in 3 months. 
 

 I was skinny before, I’m not sure where I lost that weight to be honest!!"
"I hate that I'm like this. I was so awkward during the interview. I applied to be a laundry attendant at a hotel, but the interviewer said she already filled that position and would hire me as a housekeeper instead. She asked me if I would be willing to start tomorrow...which would be the best news ever to anyone else. My dumb ass says that I can't, how about next week? Because at that moment, I was about to pass out from the fear of starting the very next day and failing. I'm almost 27. I've never had a 9-5 job, and my boyfriend financially supports me. He is happy to do so, but it doesn't erase my feelings of guilt and fear that I'll never amount to anything in life. I don't want any children, but sometimes I wish that I had them so that I could use staying home and taking care of them as an excuse.
 

 I have to text the person who interviewed me soon if I want to start on Monday. I just feel like it's going to be the same song and dance. Panic attack on Sunday night, then I'll cancel and not go. I've done this for about five jobs now. I literally don't see a way out, besides suicide. I'm sitting in a coffee shop right now, shaking like crazy. I've been in therapy, taken meds, and practiced mindfulness as much as I can. Nothing seems to help."
"(posted this in another community as well but they are less active so trying here) 
 

 Not romantically (I mean sure, reply to that as well but that's not what I'm most interested in) but more in terms of seeing you as a friend?
 

 I have some people in my class I would really like to be friends with but I have no idea how to tell if they genuinely like me or are just being nice and etc. I always feel weird and annoying and I will never ask them to hang out or anything because it feels weird.
 Especially the opposite gender, it feels like asking to do something together if you are not already good friends it sounds like asking for a date."
Hi i had psychotherapy before for an overdose i took but didn't really take. Now i got it for my childhood stuff can this actually fix anxiety / depression or is it bs thanks
"My son is about to start daycare so now I want to start school for a different career (I’m 28F and currently a massage therapist) I’m considering the three options in the title, but am worried about my anxiety and doing any of these jobs.

"I (26M) have been with my gf (25) for just under 4 years , we recently had a baby together less than a year ago (who is an absolute joy I must add) but wasn’t planned. Lately we have had a few arguments mainly about me feeling like I’m walking on eggshells with her and I’m sometimes cautious about speaking my mind with her in case it caused a reaction and she wanted me to be able to communicate more. However we resolved this and promised each other we would work on them both. Fast forward 2 months and we haven’t had any arguments since, however I’m constantly doubting our relationship and whether we are compatible and asking myself if I’m only doing this for the baby’s sake , on top of that the physical symptoms are really taking their toll on me, anytime I’m with her I’m constantly bloated with painful knots in my stomach and running to the toilet a lot more often, as soon as I’m not with her or she falls asleep at night these then go away and I feel normal again. I had similar anxiety around this time last year with her however this went away when the baby came and I haven’t had it since until now again. I love her very much but how do I tell her this is happening without hurting her feelings?"
"Hello everybody, 
 

 I'm 28f, I'm seeking some advice from you guys .... i have severe health anxiety,i've been going to therapy for the last month ,so yesterday was my 4th session and i've came to the session scared and exhausted from a week of worrying and panic attacks. It was the first time that my therapist was seeing me like this and she immediately wanted to refer me to and psychiatrist and to go on meds. She said that she cannot continue therapy with me without meds because i'm very fragile. I want to mention that a don't have suicidal thoughts, i'm not depressed, i just google a lot and i cannot stop from worrying if i have a small health problem. I don't want to take meds , i was hoping that in therapy i would learn calming exercises and stuff , but instead she wants to give me meds ... and i asked her yesterday if i don't want to take meds if we can continue the therapy and she said that we should see in a 2 sessions if i'm better , but that's the point, if my health is ok i don't stress and don't google, i do those things if a have small health issues. 
 What should i do? I affraid to take meds and actually i think that meds don't help you in the true way ."
"I’ve finally got to the point where I feel like I need the help of medication, where I can accept it for what it is, a crutch to help me get back on my feet (GAD, panic disorder &amp; emetophobia). After speaking to my psychologist today (and having had a full blown panic attack in front of them), they suggested it might be a good idea.
 

 My worry about starting is all around nausea and vomiting. Any sign of nausea and I panic. Whilst I’m worried about that, I know no one can tell me it will or won’t happen, but has anyone got experience of starting and having no nausea?
 

 How has Sertraline/Zoloft helped you and where are you today?
 

 I’m staring at the tablet!"
"I also struggle with depression, agoraphobia, GAD and OCD. Biggest issue when comes to dating is the meet up the very thought of it gives me the worst anxiety especially if it’s with someone I have t quite been able to chat with for a good while before hand. Chatting longer before a potential meet up helps ease my really bad social anxiety. But most of the time guys want to meet that few days to that week. I feel hopeless that I’ll never find love."
"I’ve been suffering pretty intensely from agoraphobia for the past few months. I’ve had it on-and-off since I was 14 but with so much stress this year it’s not exactly letting up. I’m headlining a concert tomorrow night and I’m terrified of freezing up on stage. If I even start thinking about how bad it would be if I froze up when I’m at the checkout of a shop or anything similar I start to freeze up, my body convinced I’m about to collapse/vomit. I really need therapy, but I’d love to know of any calming techniques or strategies that I could use tomorrow/tomorrow night if anybody has any to offer.
 

 I’d be so grateful for any help ❤️"
"I feel like I have zero options. Medication is terrifying me, I need relief right now as I can’t go through the potential lows. Especially this weekend"
"I usually say that after an interaction when i’m out and about, and i mostly don’t hear it back. i just left a store and said “have a good one” as i was walking off, i even held and stood there for a quick second because i expected her to say it back…is it because i don’t normally look at them when i say it, should i take it as rude if they are just quiet and give me no response back? why is it that when i go into an asian/chinese/japanese place..they always say it back to me..no matter what. i’m just a little confused..when i say it, people usually don’t say anything back then i’m left wondering if that’s normal or rude?
 

 

 just not sure if no response is negative when i say “have a good one”.."
"I am 27 year old male..i understand some people like to look at people, i do that too. it just bothers me when people do it to me. i know when to not look to make sure i done make them uncomfortable, and i feel like people look at me as if they expect me to say something to them. i do food delivery and almost 100% of the time, when i’m walking out, or walking in…people are just obviously looking directly at me.. and i don’t look at them but i notice it and it bothers me..like they all just choose ME to look at. When i used to work at walmart, i’d be minding my business..the second i turn an aisle or i’m unpacking the food items..my coworkers are just chilling, standing back and looking at me..which again i notice, and it bothers me.. but i ignore it. i’ve even had my team lead walk up to me and say “damn they all staring at u like u did something wrong but you’re the one doing your job.” so it’s not just in my head. anyone else relate?"
"I (m30) have been in a relationship with my partner (f28) for almost 5 years now, of which a little more than 2 years we have been living together.
 

 I do not know what exactly she is discussing with her therapist (now into 4-5 sessions or so) but I am positive from all research I can possibly do and within the limitations of reasonable doubt that she does have GAD or a closely related disease. The description on Wikipedia reads like a snap version of her bio. She is afraid about literally everything that has in any way to do with relationships, perceptions of her by other people and health. What has turned out to be even more dreadful than hell and devil to her though is **explaining herself**, or as she tends to put it, **""justifying"" herself**, which she equates with answering questions or expressing opinions that would require her to expose feelings and thoughts (even in moments where me or whichever collocutor have zero emotional stake in it). She admits this from time to time, saying that she always feels like she's doing it all wrong (meaning the art of life basically), that she cannot take any decision (e.g. she gives me negligible text messages and e-mails to proofread) and that she thinks of herself to be dumbest fck roaming the streets. Her anxiety has already materialized into serious physical issues through teeth grinding etc, like chronic neck and jaw pain. 
 

 What I want to add at this point for all fairness is that I have my own issues arising from childhood emotional neglect and growing up in a cult-aligned family for the first 18 years of my life. 
 

 Most of our conflicts are almost mundane: sex-life downs, different ideas about hygiene or tidiness, finding a shared hobby for ourselves or discussing her daily issues at work or with friends. From my perspective, it gets difficult when I feel like being able to help her only if she trusted me and openly shared her thoughts and feelings so that I can relate to and empathise. Unfortunately, this seems to be the major hurdle. She bombards me mostly with illogical deflections and meaningless references to outside explanations for everything that is not going well. Often, I feel forced to question and dig and dig until in 1 out of 50 cases maybe she gives me the straightforward answer that makes her look honest and vulnerable and clearly explains her actions or words and could have made the whole discussion redundant. But obviously this is impossibly sustainable and takes a big toll on her and me. That she is not able to confide in me (or at least **someone** else) to that level and defines hapiness in her life as the extent of reality-denying distractions during every minute off work is, I admit, triggering me hard on my background.
 

 How can I help my anxious gf to deal with her issues, to find the confidence for herself to tell me (or others) how she thinks and feels and establish somewhat of a trusted dialogue where we can both speak openly and do not have to go through attritional proxy battles until we can have - maybe and at most - 5 minutes of real talk. How can I convince her that revealing herself to me is part of the solution and not the problem, while avoiding triggering her endless fears?"
"I'm 28f and he's 27m. And it's just like the title says. Right now he's sick, and I feel FRANTIC. I can't calm down. He's all I can think about. It's just a kinda rough cold, I KNOW he'll be fine, but!!! Freakin' heck, I can't take it! I wanna fix it! I've been hovering like a damselfly on a lake, but I can't help it! I couldn't even finish this post because he shot up from sleeping into a freaking coughing fit and I had to grab something in case he threw up and now he's just groaning in his sleep and guys I AM LOSING MY HECCIN' MIND seriously I can't take it, I'm gonna cry or something, I am beside myself. I don't know if it's because we have a lot of the same mental health issues, so I'm overprotective, or what, but I'm seriously going nuts over this. I can't leave him alone or I'll die of worry, I swear. I'm afraid to leave him to use the bathroom, man! I can't focus on anything else right now, it's taken up my whole head. 
 

 TL;DR My fiance is sick and I'm going crazy with worry."
"I'm diagnosed with OCD and Social Phobia
 Is this person interested in me? I say person because I can't tell if what they say about their gender is genuine. I'll start.
 

 So I [25M] met this 21yo girl on okcupid. We live countries apart. ""woman, bisexual and other gender"" in her bio and as an heterosexual man I'm fine with it. I asked her a lame pickup line: ""how are you?"" and she said ""you tell me my future wife"" and things went immediately well as we appreciated each other's humor pretty well. We exchange Instagram, then we exchange numbers. After two days she kinda ghosts me. I waited some days and just told her that I like her, she's smart, funny and pretty.
 Then just replies to me that he's a dude. I say ""so what? You're still smart, funny, weird and a handsome dude"" and he replied with this vocal message 
 https://vocaroo.com/1la28glVvucD
 What do you think? Is he seeing me in a better light now that I told her my feelings or is it just a friendly compliment? She called me wifey and I called her hubby."
"Ok so the title basically says it all but here is a little bit of background. I (F26) have suffered from social anxiety for more than 15 years. Always very shy as a child, things didn't go better in my teenager years, I just felt like a misfit during my whole adolescence, barely had any friend or even classmates to talk to. 
 

 Now that I'm an adult, I can say Ive made a lot of progress. I've some people in my life I would consider freinds, others casual friends, others friendly classmates, colleagues etc. I am so obsessed with being rejected and not good/important enough that I take every signs like late replied texts, friends having other close friends,friends not calling back, friends not inviting me to their birthday party as a personal insult to me and to our friendship. I can spend days with low mood because of this. I'd like some tips from people who have been in similar situations before. 
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 TL,DR I know that I can't be best friends and a priority in everybody's life, but I can't help feeling excluded/anxious or even sad when friends don't invite me, reply late, spend time with others etc"
"Feel like I may have accidentally taken two 30mg tablets instead of one. Had a mental day so my brains all over the place and I forget whether I had already taken one or not. 
 

 Is this a big deal? Guessing not as it's not much higher than the 45mg max dose anyway?"
"I’m (28M) definitely a very shy, sensitive, socially anxious person. I don’t like being the subject of one’s attention, because a lot of my childhood trauma is from teachers and bullies singling me out for my ADHD and speech impediment. Crazy how that shit still effects me.
 

 Every now and then I’ll be told that an acquaintance, friend of a friend, has a crush on me, which is flattering, but it’s also very anxiety-inducing. It feels like I’m the object of someone’s attention, that they’re hyper focusing on or hyper-analyzing me like I’m being inspected (even if they’re not). This gets pushed even more, if the particular woman has an “intense energy” to her that can feel overwhelming when 1-on-1.
 

 Anyone else feel anxious in a similar way, or know how to cope?"
"I am a female in my late 20s. I had a “mental breakdown” at the beginning of this year, it felt like a constant 24/7 unrelenting panic attack with no moments of coming down. It started off as just an episode of hypochondria about something silly, but the stress pushed me over the edge. It changed me forever and it lasted months. I became convinced I was losing my mind, researching things about schizophrenia. I was so terrified every second of every day, I couldn’t function or be alone all I did was panic. I also became so dissociated (depersonalization and derealization) and I was stuck in that state constantly. Nothing looked or felt real, I felt like I was in a scary and strange parallel universe. I started getting a little better, and for months I was improving. But I was left still with daily derealization, still pretty severe anxiety and depression. I have really negative, scary and strange thoughts about existence itself, what the point of everything is, feeling like I’m in a simulation. Going into stores or outside and even some times my house especially in certain lighting, everything just looks wrong and too much. Like my eyes aren’t open all the way even though they are. Like I’m in a dream but it feels scary or kind of sinister. My eye sight also got really messed up during the months of severe anxiety and panic. I now live with so many eye floaters I see all day, my eyes just don’t adjust to dim lighting and it’s like my eyes can’t process things anymore so nothing looks crisp or still, I now have visual snow as well. Ever since then I wake up every morning and just feel pain, fear, and sadness because I feel I will never be myself again. Everything just started to get worse again, all of it. I just feel so off and strange and scared and depressed and SO painfully anxious all the time. I’m not sleeping well and I normally do. I feel like something really bad is happening, my facial expressions feel flat and just genuinely feel terrified. It’s like I FEEL mentally ill and feel like my mental state is deteriorating. Every day I feel worse and less like myself. I just want myself back. I have once again convinced myself that I am developing schizophrenia. I’m terrified every moment of every day. I can’t feel anything but fear and depression, I feel very distracted and unmotivated. I’m afraid to be alone but sometimes feel better when I am, a little calmer not having to interact with people constantly while I’m feeling like this. All I want to do is lay in bed. I see a psychiatrist who wants me to try an antipsychotic for anxiety and depression although she doesn’t think I’m at all psychotic. But I tend to react badly to medication and I’m scared of that too but I can’t live like this. All I do is monitor and worry about my mental state. Just looking for advice/support/anyone who can relate. Sorry this is long. Also I’m so far diagnosed with panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and depression. Anxiety being the worst."
"It was supposed to be in a funny way but I think he missed out on the context and now I worry it came across as rude because of that. I cannot go ask about it because I don't know him that well and it would be incredibly awkward and there is a high chance I would get a 100 new things to ruminate about after. Also it's half a week ago and it keeps bothering me.
 

  It happens in many social situations and I will always ruminate until the person makes an indication that they like me. So if anyone has any general advice on how to stop it that would be great. It mainly happens when it's people I find having an interesting personality. For some reason my anxiety don't care about what people I find uninteresting think, but it goes into overdrive when there are people I do find interesting (not in a romantic way - just to clarify)"
"I’m going to start tonight, I need to. I’ve had breakdown the last 4 days non stop crying, panic attacks, agitation and depression. I’ve felt sick all the time (as an emetophobia sufferer, constant panic).
 

 I’m going to try 25mg to start for a few days and then jump to 50mg. 
 

 I need that final bit of encouragement and positive stories. How manageable was your nausea, or even better, did you not have any?"
"Hi All - been perusing the community for a while, finally feeling comfortable enough to share what’s been going on.
 

 The holidays have been a time of heightened anxiety ever since I was in elementary school. Growing up, we didn’t have much in terms of money, and I constantly had to see family and friends get many expensive gifts. 
 

 Since we didn’t have much money, we’d often hand-craft our gifts to others. In elementary and middle school, I was laughed at for these presents, and I feel as though it’s done irreparable damage to my mental state around the holidays and gift giving.
 

 I’m much better off now financially (25F, full-time employee college graduate who can afford rent every month and has the occasional splurge) but I’m feeling those same anxious feelings creeping back up when trying to purchase gifts for family and my SO (25M).
 

 They’ve all assured me that it’s not the price of the gifts that matter, but rather the thought of giving. I just can’t seem to shake the dread whenever I make a purchase for someone in that they’ll hate it or it’ll be wasteful.
 

 Hoping some of you might have some helpful advice or tips, or just support that I’m not the only person to feel like this at the holidays."
"Today, I enrolled in classes to become a medical assistant. This is a big deal for me because there are some classes that I will have to take on campus and some online. I only took online classes for my last degree because I was too afraid to set foot in a classroom. However, the degree is very general and doesn’t have a clear career path. I’ve always wanted to work in healthcare, but I let my social anxiety hold me back from pursuing that. I’m not letting it keep me from chasing my dreams anymore! I have a vision of the life I’d like to live and I’m going to fight for it. 
 

 I was also recently prescribed sertraline and I’m noticing some improvement with my anxiety. So, I’m hoping that paired with the propanolol that I’ve already been taking will help me get through school as well. 
 

 I just wanted to share this with you guys to encourage you to face your fears! I know first hand how social anxiety robs us of so much, but we have the power to take control of our lives. I’m not saying it will be easy, but it’s possible!"
"Like there apart of my life for only one reason and every action there taking right now shows me why I should hate because like damn. I deserved the bad parts and this new person in your life they get praised by everyone I’m not jealous or anything it’s the fact that why did I get done wrong but it is what it is.. they doing them and I’m doing me and I rather not focus on it.. no response is an response clearly… 
 

 Fuck them"
"My boyfriend (30M) has anxiety, but he doesn’t feel comfortable talking about it much so I’m trying to understand him. My boyfriend was very disorganized and out of touch today, I didn’t see him personally, but for example he went for a walk, got back and took a shower then immediately went back to walking. It felt as if he’s on something, he also told me things but after a while he forgot that he told me, he took random pictures. I asked him are you on something? He said no. Then he started talking to me about how anxious he is because his friend’s little daughter has cancer, it triggered his fears of having a sick baby, and he was very nervous while talking about this so we spent an hour or so on the phone until i was able to calm him down and reassure him. It’s my first time ever seeing this side of him. I would like to know do you guys experience those symptoms when you’re having an extreme anxiety episode? Especially the forgetfulness."
"Like threw out my whole I’ve been treated like dirt by people that I called family and people that I loved and I always told myself every time was there something wrong with me… but as soon as they leave my life there somehow better off without me… all of this makes me feel like shit and just wanna start back smoking an drinking cause I’m at that point of feeling truly numb… 
 

 Idk what to do but I’ll try my best to not fuck up… but who really knows.."
"Hi all! I (26F) suffer from an anxiety disorder. Though my anxiety is milder in some areas of my life, I would say that it is the most severe in terms of health anxiety. I cannot tell you all how many times I have convinced myself I have terminal cancer based on some small bump, detail, or symptom that was the slightest bit out of the ordinary. For reference, I have never been diagnosed with cancer, nor do I have a family history of it. Overall I am in very good health.
 

 This morning I noticed that a mole on my neck looked a little red and inflamed. It also stung a little when I touched it. I check my skin pretty religiously because I am very fair skinned and I know that mole didn’t look like that a day or two ago. I’ve decided to go in and get it checked out and I was lucky enough to get an appointment first thing tomorrow to see a dermatologist.
 

 Meanwhile, I am honestly totally freaked out and scared. This is the first time I’ve ever gone to see a dermatologist due to a change in a mole and all I’m thinking about is the worst case scenario. I’m struggling to stay focused on work today (I’m on my lunch break now) because of how freaked out I am. At 26 I feel like my life is just beginning, but my biggest fear is losing my life before it has even begun.
 

 Mainly just needed to get this off my chest. Thank you for making it through my vent."
Does anybody get the sensation of one weak hand/relaxed hand (I don't know how to explain it) but when using it it is perfectly normal? I am getting super anxious about this.
"What medication has worked for you with taboo intrusive thoughts? 
 For context: After a trauma I had two years ago, I started developing some very concerning Intrusive thoughts. First it started with “you don’t love your partner” to “you want to diddle kids” to “you’ve got cancer” to all other sorts of deeply disturbing thoughts that are NOT true at all. I have constant anxiety, I’ve isolated myself because it’s better when I’m not around people. But I live with my partner and I do not want to leave; although I do want to escape the anxiety. 
 I went into inpatient last year and the psychiatrist said I had depression and ptsd and anxiety and sent me on my way. It was my therapist that sent me to psychiatrist and suggested I might have OCD. I have objected to medication because I have tried many before the OCD diagnosis and they all have had some kind of side effect that has made me worse. Latuda made me antsy and gave me restless leg. Prozac didn’t do much for me. Wellbutrin ruined my life and took the last of my happiness. My psychiatrist has suspended my gabapentin prescription because I was on a high dose and even with that dose it didn’t do much. When I have a big episode I go numb. I’m pretty numb to everything. I don’t remember the last time I actually felt something more than content. Not happy, not joy, not okay. Just okay. 
 If anyone has had the same issue or even something vaguely like it and they found a medication that truly helped- please comment below. I hope this post get some traction because I need help."

"I saw someone post on here about feeling like a little kid. I relate to this 100%. I've lost friends because they progressed in life, obtained new memories, graduated college, and entered their dream job fields when I'm just....me. The sting of that is all-consuming.
 

 My partner and I moved a couple of months ago, and it's the easiest thing in the world to find work out here (small town) because everyone is desperately hiring. I've had three job offers that I've been unable to accept because of my panic attacks. My world is so tiny, and the amount that I can comfortably do is smaller than its ever been. I'm basically agoraphobic. I have no friends. My partner goes to work and I stay home, working on my class or looking at jobs that I won't be able to accept/will ultimately be underqualified for.
 

 As a result, I've sought out remote work, and an opportunity that initially seemed promising feels like it's slipping away from me now as the recruiter examines my resume in more detail. Going from confidently believing I was qualified, to questioning gaps in my resume and noticing I have essentially no professional experience.
 

 The years go by, and all I have to fall back on is a college degree. So fucking what? I went to high school and college. I got a piece of paper. I'm getting my Master's now. What for? I don't have the necessary job experience. I won't go far with what I have. I've wasted my 20s. It all feels so bleak and hopeless. The times that I've rejected opportunities are showing up.
 

 I feel like I won't make it in life. A world built for the confident, the extroverted. The physically and mentally able. I was recently rejected for disability benefits, so that solidified that nothing is working for me. I'm so fucking depressed. I've been ready to end it all for quite some time now."
Sorry for posting alot recently but I am having a really bad period. I'm doing a group project with 2 students that get top grades and that are really striving for top grades and 1 who gets good grades and me who passes. I feel like I'm dragging the entire group down because my work is of poor quality (we do architecture) and I feel guilty to the point where I am thinking of dropping out or some how find a way to be excluded. We are all doing our masters which adds to the pressure. (this is our 2nd project as a group which makes it worse since the first didn't go well at all)

"I'm 25 and asked my doctor to do an EKG when I saw her a while ago, she said it came back normal... I've still been afraid that she may have missed something when she gave me a check-up. I feel that something may be wrong with me that she could have missed.  
 

 

 Is it normal for a clean bill of health to not decrease anxiety?"
"Hello all,
 My husband is currently getting surgery. Luckily it's outpatient so it's a pretty common surgery. I am really worried about him and he's my best friend. I'm so nervous and this next hour feels like it's going to take forever. Any advice on how to deal while I wait? I feel so sick from all the anxiety. Thanks ❤"
"It happened again. Woke up shaking and in fear. I have failed. I spent so much time yesterday ensuring I'd wake up feeling okay, and to continue that streak. It lasted just two days. That's all I get, is two little mornings of not waking up with stupid ass anxiety. Just two. Now I can look back and remember the COUNTLESS mornings where I woke up shaking and scared. I am fucking sick of it. I don't want to commit suicide, I really don't. The process is likely painful and scary but I cannot live a life of pain. I cannot live everyday in an anxious state. Existing is NOT THE SAME as living. I can exist without trying, I do so without even my own input. I don't live. I struggle moment to moment just trying to not have a panic attack, to not get the urge to go hide in a dark room. Spent two months afraid of death, now all I have to say to death is, what the fuck are you waiting for? You make me scared enough to take away all the magic in life, but too scared to take me? Come on mother fucker I am finished!!! My family isn't the same, my life isn't the same and is headed towards shit, end my suffering. This shit isn't worth it anymore. If I don't die then I'll just waste every fucking day in bed until I either feel better or get the courage to find something to kill my useless self with. I am glad I have spent time collecting coins, if I die they will have a nice and altogether permanent thing to remember me by, and I hope they remember the version of me that laughed at jokes and enjoyed things, not the shell and shitless version of myself I am now. I used to be somebody, I am not anymore. I am 25 this Saturday, that about as long as I ever thought I'd live. It makes sense then, I may have predicted my own lifespan in the past accurately. If I do die soon may I do so in peace, and may my family find peace again after my death, grant them the ability to do what I was incapable of. To any strangers reading this, I hope whatever pain that may drive you down a path that I am on seise to exist and permanently. I tried making it in this life, I tried."
"I’ve asked this before, but does anyone else suffer with unbearable hunger pains that do not subside even when eating. My doctors just won’t listen to me and tell me it’s anxiety when all they’ve done is a physical examination on my stomach.
 

 It may not even be hunger, but that’s the only way I can describe it. It doesn’t bother me in the morning but throughout the day it gets worse. I’m taking a PPI (Prevacid) and it doesn’t seem to be controlling it, so I don’t know if it’s my anxiety. 
 

 I have started on Sertraline too."
"Every situation and like every person I encountered like there’s always an issue or something that occurs but who suffers at the end me.. or left alone without anyone to understand me.. like I was talking to someone about how it was like when I didn’t have any body all they told me was turn towards my family and I told them when I needed someone no cared to even check if I was okay…. I was just left alone.. in the dark… all I got for advice was talk to other people it might make you feel better… did it really nope..

"Hello! This might be a dumb question, but here goes..
 

 I've been having gastro issues all year, due to being in a very stressful situation. I've had it all, except vomiting. Really.. had it all..
 

 Lately I'm dealing with bloating (apparently it gets better sometimes but comes back), knot feeling upper abdomen, a bit of nausea sometimes, acid reflux, gut noises, ocassionaly stabbing pains mostly right side, although not too bad, and soft, smooth, thin stools.
 Also, I'm having bowel movement every 3 or 4 days, but maybe that's because I'm having a very lousy breakfast and only one other meal every day, cause I can't afford more.
 

 Earlier I've had very frequent bowel movements, diarrhea, constant stomach pain, everything I ate would make me feel sick.
 

 Also the stools now got thin and soft from one day to the other, it wasn't gradual.
 

 Now the question! (It's in the title..so no surprise here lol)
 I'm worried about all kinds of cancer, obviously... But isn't all this variation of symptoms, a positive thing? Like, of course it's not good going through this, but isn't that a sign that it's not cancer? I'm still under a lot of stress, and like I said, I'm not eating a lot, and not eating well either.
 

 I know it can be a lot of things, I just don't want it to be cancer. There was never blood in stool, apart from a couple of times where I had ruptures (is that what they're called?). And never vomited. I had fatigue, but it went away long time ago, and I don't seem to be losing excessive amounts of weight, apart from the obvious due to lack of regular eating.
 

 The constant stomach pains sort of went away a few days ago, maybe a week ago. But I'm worried there's a blockage somewhere, a tumor, and it's only gonna get worse.. although it's been months, like more than half a year, and I'm still somewhat okay, like, wouldn't it be much, much worse by now?

"Hello, I am 26F with chronic severe anxiety. I started taking Paxil for it when I was 15 starting at the lowest dose. Now I am at the highest dose (60mg) and feel like maybe it has stopped working.
 

 I efffecively cannot leave the house. I had a traumatic experience last year where I flew to and from my destination without medication (I usually have to take Xanax) and had a few traumatic experiences at my destination too.
 

 Ever since then, I have been unable to be a passenger or drive in a car. Every time I'm in a moving car I feel like I am experiencing that awful falling turbulence sensation. Obvs, this causes me a lot of problems with not being able to leave my house. I also have terrifying derealization when I leave the house. Even in the safety of my house, I dissociate and feel that falling or about-to-fall sensation.
 

 Prior to the trip last year, I had been driving anxiety free since I was 17.
 

 I've tried exposure therapy a few separate times and gotten the ability back, but never for more than a few weeks before the sensation returns. 
 

 I'm wondering if anybody has experienced this strange symptom of anxiety? Or derealization? And what did you do that helped?
 

 (I'm also probably going to be tapering off Paxil which is so scary so any tips about handling withdrawal are much appreciated) 
 

 Thanks for reading and this wonderful community!"
"28M I've had severe anxiety for 4 years now, symptoms over time have varied some new, some returning, but lately have had this icy, almost wet sensation around specific muscles, followed by twitching. Most frequently around the right side of my scalp and it's enough to send me spiraling for days. I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience."
"1st At home, my parents fought a lot during my childhood and adolescence, my mother is super anxious but extroverted and very protective of me and my father is paranoid, almost schizophrenic.
 

 2nd Meanwhile, at school I was bullied a lot because I had retrognathism and that was a nightmare because I felt so bad that I never wanted to make friends, I preferred to stay at home and listen to my parents fighting.
 

 I know to what extent it's my fault for not having friends or never having a girlfriend. The truth is that I don't do anything to change it other than waiting for the day of my surgery that will happen in 2 or 3 years. I'm 26 years old though."

 Note: I had these symptoms 6 years back( due to home sick) and took a bunch of tests, they all came back negative. Now it started right after my mom got sick and I couldn’t be there for her as i was in different country and i had to undergo a simple surgery here at the same time and was idle for weeks.

 I also became hypersensitive to my bodily sensations over the years which maybe contributing to half of the symptoms here or some of it maybe normal for regular people as well. I don’t know what is normal anymore. I am prone to constant worry 24/7. Recently have been worse with health anxiety and stress.
 

 As debilitating as these symptoms may sound, it never bothered me when i am out from home or day to day activities until recently i started googling and reading reddits constantly."
"i have tirelessly searched the internet for people i can relate to on this issue but have failed so i guess i’ll post about it myself. my social anxiety manifests in a weird way, that sometimes makes me questions if i’m a sociopath. i feel like i’m completely socially incompetent. when i’m having a conversation with someone l, i almost never ask them questions about themselves. it’s not because i don’t care about them or their lives, it just feels like i have a complete mental blockade?? half the time i’m reminding myself that i need to ask them questions, but my mind goes blank and i can’t think of anything, the other half of the time i completely forget that that’s how conversations work until afterwards, then i realize i didn’t ask anything and feel awful. people must perceive me as incredibly self absorbed, and half the time i have myself questioning if i actually am. but i don’t think i am? i don’t really want to talk about myself either, but conversations usually end up about me because i just let other people guide the conversation. i feel like such a wet blanket lmao. 
 

 i really don’t know where this issue stems from, i think the biggest source is people in my childhood getting mad at me for asking questions. it could also be that i’ve always been shy, and never properly learned social skills because my parents were soft with me and didn’t push me too hard on it. idk, it cause me so much anxiety though because it just heightens the feeling that everyone hates me (and they probably do! having a conversation with me must suck!). 
 

 with my closest friends even i find myself not really asking them things, usually at that point in a friendship they just offer things up and i learn about them that way. i can talk about a subject forever with my close friends but when it comes to asking direct personal questions i am incapable. 
 

 an example: today i talked to my dad on the phone. he just got back from a month long europe trip, but i didn’t ask him about it for some reason?? it wasn’t until the end of the conversation (where the entire thing was him asking me about my life) when he in passing said “yeah our trip was great” that i realized my dumbass hadn’t asked about it. 
 

 anyways this was long and babbling but i just want to see if anyone can relate or have any advice for me. i am just feeling my social ineptitude hard recently and it really hurts my relationships. i want to be a good friend and i want to connect properly with people, and i simply am at a loss to why i’m like this."
"Hi! So me(26F) and my bf(28m) met abroad, and have been in dating for almost 3 years now. We lived in a foreign country together so our mutual friends are a very small circle.
 Now for for the first time in those 3 years we came back to his city and I’m meeting all of his friends tomorrow, they’re gonna have a cookout and I was super onboard with it until today when I was told there were going to be 20+ people at this event.
 Now I’m rambling on and on in my head if I’m gonna be able to sustain it? I’m feeling super anxious about it all and I’m super introverted so I never have much to talk about and I don’t want to come off as the annoying gf who doesn’t socialize or randomly has to leave (due to anxiety/overwhelm)
 My bf keeps telling me they’re all super chill and it’s going to be ok but that idea doesn’t help, it’s still 20 people who I don’t know, from a completely different culture and they all know and relate to each other except me 😭 any advice would be greatly appreciated please"

"Tomorrow I (26M) am supposed to attend a wedding invite at a restaurant. I know only two people at the party and it is unavoidable, I have to go. Most of these people are rich, snobby academics and I cannot rely on my friend to spend time with me. What do I do?"
"I (25F) don’t have any friends I talk to. If one of my 3 older friends (all whom live in other states) messages me, I will get anxiety so serious that I can’t even open the message on my phone. Every time I see it, I will get heart palpitations. 
 

 They only ever text me if I reach out to them first (only once or twice a year) and while I get the impression the messages are nice from the short blurb I can see without opening it fully, I cannot bring myself to open them. I don’t even have read receipts on so I’m not sure why I can’t.
 

 I’m really lonely and haven’t had any friends for a few years now. The idea of trying to make friends scares me, and I wouldn’t even know where to try to begin. 
 

 My coworkers both at my most recent three jobs seem to genuinely dislike me or at least be annoyed by me, and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. 
 

 I really just go to work and then go home and that’s it. My family has issues as well. Many of my extended family doesn’t talk to me at all (despite close proximity) and my immediate family also has a lot of issues. Every time I talk to my only sister, she starts yelling at me even if I walk on eggshells around her. My dad is never sober. I only really talk to my mom.
 

 I really don’t know what to do."
Trying to cry but I can’t.. feeling like everything I worked so hard to build is crumbling beneath me.. like realizing you can do a lot and it not be enough just rips you apart on the inside.. I want to feel better but I feel like I lost my way along time ago..
"Im (25F) not entirely sure if this is an anxiety attack, but it has happened thrice now. Each time, it was my first day of menstruation. 
 

 First, I would feel pain in my lower back, ankles, and knees, which are normal when its my time of the month. Then i start feeling poopy, more than normal. 
 

 Few hours later, id start feeling cold, but sweaty at the same time. Id want to curl up all the time. Based on the 3 times it has happened to me, this is the sign that i'd get ""anxiety attacks"" and i start feeling restless.
 

 Tears would slowly fall down my cheeks. Id get a heavy feeling in my chest, kind of like feeling very nervous. Id be like that for a few mins, then my heart starts racing. I would try to clear my thoughts, and it works for a while until it doesnt. 
 

 The third time it happened, my coworker noticed, and they accompanied me to the clinic. I could walk, but only a few steps, until i feel like shutting down or sleeping. Then id ""wake up"" and start walking, then i shut down (not faint cus i was conscious) again. So they decided to carry me instead. this is when it got worse. While they were carrying me, Id breath so fast and heavy, like im gasping for air, while tears fall continuously. I could hear them, but i didnt have much control over my body. When we got to the clinic, I couldnt lie down, because it's harder to breathe that way. So i would stay sat down. Theyd let me breathe in essential oils (menthol), but i couldnt smell it. Then eventually, i would fall asleep. When i wake up a few hours later, its like nothing happened. Id feel normal again. 
 

 Id like to know whats happening. It has only ever happened once in a year for 3 consecutive years. Has it happened to anyone?"
"I got it prescribed for an infected pimple. I have bad health anxiety and just vaguely remember antibiotics always making me a little more anxious, idk if it was all in my head or not but i don’t like taking them..has anyone taken Doxycycline before? Did you end up being okay? I just would like to know other people that have taken it, that way i can feel better and go ahead and take my first dose…thank you."
"I am 26 years old, have a lot of anxiety and stressors in my life… I get random anxiety attacks from absolutely doing not a thing …. Lately I’ve been muscular pains, heart flutters which became very recently which currently has me stuck in an attack because I’m afraid my hearts gonna fail if I make my heart race… warm face &amp; chin… head pressure and mild chest pains. I’ve been to the ER many many times for any symptom and I get pushed off as just “anxiety “ today, I actually got sent for lab work to clear me of most things that could be causing these symptoms… lately I have this pressure, pulsating pressure on the left side of my temple that’s believed to just be once again, anxiety. I constantly feel numb and short of breath… all my EKGs come back fine, my echocardiogram was great, chest X-rays are good… I just feel empty lately, very dissociative.. I am actually terrified to be home alone with my 10 month old &amp; 2 year old… like what if something happens when it’s just us ?? I also get these muscle spasm feelings in my chest, &amp; neck &amp; head sometimes.. I take anxiety meds daily I just feel like nothing helps me …. Any little wrong feeling I panic… when my kids are sick I go into panic attacks because I fear death, I don’t know. I’m afraid to fall asleep because what if I don’t wake up…. Help."
"Hi everybody :)
 

 I’m a 25F and I struggle with depression/anxiety and am in the process of being diagnosed with CFS. I have been seeing a mental health support worker for two years now and this is my 3rd one. The first one was super lovely however she moved away due to getting another job. The second one…well, that’s another story but it’s pretty similar to my current support worker. 
 

 Let’s call my current one S and I’ll try explain below in bullet points what’s going on. I’ve been seeing her for a little over a year now. It’s hard bc I feel like she cares about me but she shows it in the wrong way and it comes across as more of a “friend” vibe rather than a supportive mental health worker vibe. But I get into this, I will just mention this but it’s not confirmed. I feel like she almost has some kind of intellectual disability. I know she suffers from schizophrenia or something similar however she can be quite childlike at times and says the strangest things. 
 

 1. She’s told me about other clients she has - their names and what’s going on with them eg a hoarder and what the state of their house is like. She’s also told me about a client who committed suicide after S found her slashing her wrists. I felt sick after she told me this and it honestly made me feel really upset. 
 2. She keeps touching my hands/hugging me when it’s clear from my body language I do NOT want this. When she gets here every time, I open the door to let her in and she hugs me which I hate. I have started to stand back once I open the door but she doesn’t seem to realise how uncomfortable I am and just hug me anyway. When we are sitting at the table and I’m talking about something, she will often hold my hand/squeeze it if it’s on the table. I have started keeping my hands in my sleeves or fiddling with my water bottle or something on the table but she doesn’t seem to notice and still does it anyway. Last time she did it, I said to say it made you feel uncomfortable when she does that but she either didn’t hear me or didn’t want to because just talked over me and it made me very angry. I hate it when people touch me like this and every time she does, I’m mentally freeze up and cringing inside and just associate until she either lets go or I pull away because I hate it so much. 
 3. She turns up early with no warning. We meet at 2 pm every Monday. There’s been several incidents where she has turned up at 1:30 or 1:45 with no warning except a text while she is parked in my driveway. I’m often still in the shower when she does this and it stresses me out greatly. Once she simply texted me saying she turned up early “so we could spend more time together” It gives off weird friend vibes and I HATE it.
 4. She tells me about her personal life such as her rent going up, her weight loss, what’s going on her family etc. It really annoys me as she will obviously turn the conversation towards her. She’ll say something like “Oh, it seems like both of us have had a lot going on…” and then go on about her life.
 5. She seems to have no backbone and sometimes forget I’m actually an adult. I have a complicated relationship with my mother who is my neighbour. I also rent the property from my parents that I live in. In the past my mother has called S and even turned up in the middle of our meetings and S has been like a dead fish in regards to telling my mother to leave as I’ve been so upset crying. 
 6. Her workplace kindly gives each client a Christmas present. She has asked me multiple times what I would like and I have said I would like supermarket/gas vouchers as they are things I actually need. She suggested a lunch boat cruise for the two of us which not only is completely something unnecessary I do not want, it is also something I would be doing with her which I do not want. 
 7. She randomly will whip out her phone and show me a “good deed” she’s done lately or play a song and sing. I was talking about how I want to eventually buy a tiny house one day and she got it in her head that it would be a good idea for her to buy one for herself. She kept trying to take my phone to look at the ones I was showing her online. I hated that she was doing that and in my personal space so I sent her the links so she wouldn’t have to keep doing it but it just made me very uncomfortable. 
 8. She has told me things about her personal life that I do not think I should be aware of - I understand transparency and being open is important for someone in her job however I felt quite uncomfortable when she informed me that she was hospitalised years ago for trying to rob a bank with a banana.
 9. I feel like she is wanting ME to give her advice when she talks about her personal life which annoys me as she should be the one supporting me. She will make comments about how she’s feeling overwhelmed at her boss is being a jerk lately or something like that and I feel like I’m expected to say something back that’s helpful but I’m often at a loss because I’m dealing with my own drama in life. 
 

 Overall I have had issues with her workplace as a whole. I won’t make this too long but with my last support worker, she would turn up unannounced at my house and also I said I was not messages cooperating when I didn’t reply to her during work hours because I was at work. Long story short that support worker ended up getting asked to leave. 
 

 On the days that S has been away sick in the past; another support worker will sometimes call or text me to see if I want to see them instead. A few months ago, a relief support worker called my mother and asked her how she was doing and apparently they had an in-depth conversation which they had no right to be having as I am a fully capable adult. I was furious when my mother told me as it complicated our relationship (she was saying stuff like how the support worker was supporting HER for dealing with ME which made absolutely no sense…) I ended up calling the workplace and speaking to the boss and told it was completely unacceptable to which she agreed. I had asked for my family to be removed from my contact numbers on my file and it not been done at the time which very much infuriated me.
 

 I have thought about reporting S to her workplace - my sister and my friend who I’ve spoken to both agree that she has been completely unprofessional. However I would feel bad if I reported her because she obviously cares about me however the way she goes about it is completely unprofessional. I also don’t think I want to stop seeing her is as much of a hindrance these things can be, I like the fact I can talk to her about what’s going on with my family what I’m struggling with lately without any bias however I always am exhausted when she leaves because I feel so guarded and irritated by her crossing boundaries. Her workplace has also mentioned discharging me several times in the past due to them having a lot waitlisted however without S, I would have no professional support at all. So I guess you could say I am at a loss for what to do. 
 

 I am seeing her later today and I am feeling quite anxious about it in regard to her touching my hands especially. I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions. Thanks in advance :)"
"My arms and head have been feeling fatigued ever since starting my new medication, fluoxetine 20mg every day. Im worried something else is going on. Was hoping someone else had a similar experience? Any help would being me peace of mind.. Thank you."
"hi friends - i’m on 20mg of Lexapro that i take in the mornings. i just took one at work because i thought i’d forgotten, but now i’m thinking i did take it already this morning. should i be concerned?"
"I don't really know how to begin. I'm a 26f and I have bad trouble sleeping before work, and I think it is because of the commute and not the job itself. I got my drivers license in March, and I don't like driving very much, especially not my 30 minute highway commute.
 

 I work from home pretty frequently, and when I do that I sleep fine. I told my boss about this, and he was really nice about it, so now I go to the office on mandags, and WFH the rest of the week.
 

 Anyway, here we are monday night, and it has happened again. I can feel that I AM tired, but my body just doesn't let me sleep. I have tried all the sleep advice and stuff that people always mention, but it does not help 
 

 I am planning on getting therapy for this, and trying quitting BC to see if that helps, but I just want to hear if anyone has experienced something similar, and if so, how did you overcome it?"
"Does anyone have any success stories or advice for potentially coming off antidepressants and managing their anxiety? I’ve not been on them for long, but due to the nature of my anxiety and it’s triggers (feeling ill), I don’t think they are for me.
 

 I’m early enough into the process to come off them, but what have people done to manage their anxiety?
 

 I’d say I’m in a pretty low place, feeling ill most days, nauseous without anxiety spikes, off work, no motivation but I feel like medication is triggering me more than if I was off it."
"I'm working myself up to a first attempt driving around the M25 and the Dartford crossing this weekend. I'm very anxious about it, but I'm going to watch some videos on YouTube and look through the route on Google to try and make myself feel a bit better.
 

 Today I drove somewhere new wholly reliant on Google maps. And then on the way back, I went a different route again. I managed both times fine so it was a good mini confidence boost. That said, still bricking it for the weekend...!"
"The PT came today and I'm normally a little nervous or anxious in the elevator to let him up and as he's administering PT to my father I'm asking questions without getting nervous haha. I really hope this isn't placebo please!
 

 Edit: I even made more than half a second of eye contact while talking!"
Like hearing that showed me I should of never cared the way I did and all the response to you was like “I was just being straight up” well this person clearly pointed me in the right direction to not care anymore. It hurt hearing that but it just showed me he didn’t really need to know what’s going on with me.
"Hello Everyone.  
 

 

 This is my first post in Reddit. I felt that i might need to write somethnig down and I figured is the best place here. I am 28 years old Male 
 

 

 I dont know even how to start this post and keep it simple because it is not all clear in my head. 
 

 

 I just know hat i feel like i am dead insite me. I just dont remember when it was the last time i felt pure happiness ( I smile and laugh at some things and jokes but it is just all in the surface). 
 I dont hava any interess in life, i dont have any hobbies I dont have any desires in life, there is not one think i wish for me to buy for myself or enjoy in anthing( i have enough money to afford some things) I dont have any social life at all!!! (I have moved 5 years ago to the new country and havent find some friend at all. To be honest i didnt even try)  
 

 

 I am in good health , I have a good job and I earn fair amount of money. My family is in good health we have contact but not so often ( one a month), and we ( I ) dont speak to much about private things.  
 

 

 I am married for 2 years(no kids), before that 6 years in a relationship with the same girl. Our marriage is not that perfect we have ups and downs and so was our relationship.( but I guess that is true for all relationshipps or....? )we have never broke up with each other but we have a lot of difficult moment with strong fights during our relationship, and now sometimes also in the marriage. I believe we love each other but I can feel she is also miserable with her life.  
 

 

 Why is this happening insite my head. I had a fun childhood and fun life in collage, at least i tought so, or i just force myslef to believe so, and that is the most scary thing now, now when I look back into my life I think i have always been miserable, that i have always been unhappy and i just force myself to believe that i am having fun.  
 

 

 I dont know what is wrong with me. Sometimes I think I cant not control my mind and somethings i think I am just exaggerates things. it is all so fucked up .  
 

 

 Sorry for the long post and bad English."
The person I’m with told me they love me but isn’t in love with me.. and he doesn’t know if he wants this relationship.. what hurts more is Iives with me and idk what to expect when he comes home.. like I’ve pampered this person from the beginning and done whatever I could to make it work and knowing it wasn’t ever enough hurts more.. idk if we’re together and idk what’s going to happen from here.. I pushed so many people away because of him.. and shut a lot of people out because of this relationship.. not feeling more lonely then I’ve ever been.. I have no one to run to and no one to tell what’s going on with me.. it’s just me myself and I… 😢
"i (26m) , when i had 23 an incident changed my life 
 Before 18 Aug 2020, i got everything in control,my life,my mental health,my finances,my emotions. After that everything collapsed and anxiety,stress,depression took place, and i just lost interest in life. I didnt get confort or help from anyone not even from friends that i thought we shared a brotherhood with them (fuck all this fake ass’s friends), that was the reason i found my self dragging to addiction and isolation trying to get the support that i needed but unfortunately that only make things worst..
 

 I was lost, so lost in my thoughts ,starting to have doubts about myself ,my capability,the meaning of my life, my future, my existence , I was mad so fkn mad, hatred and loneliness was consuming me. Couldn't do anything at the moment besides smoking my pain away.
 

 Couple years passed, Lost more than 95% of my fake friends, let the door open for few new people some of them helps me and listened to me when i need it , so now they are friends that i can relate on them.
 

 I started the healing process, but i still feel the sadness and emptiness inside me its like a cancer. I am trying to keep good habits ( going to the gym, cook, activities outdoor, reading..) but i have the lack of motivation and lack of pleasure doing things. 
 

 I made a list with the things, goals and that I wanna achieve in the short,mid,long term future,and i know that only me, myself,and i how to make that happen and no one else. 
 

 I m sorry guys if my ideas are not in order , but its the first time that i talk about this situation and to be honest its a huge weight on my heart. i hoppe talking about it and get it out will be the first step for me to find inner peace and be happy again in this life.
 

 Thankyou for reading"
"It sometimes makes me feel like my friends that I text with (and used to see in person before COVID) are just putting up with me, or don’t actually care much about our friendship. In the early months of the pandemic I was calling people up pretty often just to check in and keep up communication. Last year one of my closest friends of the past while sent me a crazy, out of nowhere text message saying that she didn’t want me in her life anymore, to f\*ck off, and not to contact her anymore. We hadn’t even spoken in months, and it was really painful to hear all that.  
 

 After that experience, I feel like I’ve gotten lazier about keeping in touch with people, since I don’t want to feel like I’m being annoying to anyone by texting them too often."
"My relationship of 8 years recently ended and I feel like my anxiety is coming back. I’m afraid to fall back in the big hole of anxiety and spending months and months with extreme anxiety. I recently overcame my worst anxiety episode in the past year. I’m extremely scared to relapse.
 

 My GF of 8 years left me and since then. I’ve been going through a roller coaster of emotions. At the beginning I felt so confident and good about myself.
 

 Today, after 1 month, I feel extremely depressed, extremely insecure, to the point I feel fat, ugly, boring, like nothing I do makes me feel good, not my hair, not my clothes nothing… 
 

 What do I do? I’ve never felt this insecure in my life (27M). I’m scared of how I’m feeling.
 Any tips ?"

"I am 26 years old and I just got diagnosed with ADHD. I don’t know how to feel. I feel relieved and not at the same time! I know it’s normal to feel this way but I just can’t believe I’ve been this way for so long and struggled most of my life up until now. What should I expect from here on out?
 I’m currently in the process of getting medication ie getting blood work etc
 I just feel like I got diagnosed and that was that …"
"So for some context, I've suffered from anxiety for as long as I can remember. I'm 25 F, and I've just managed to try to live with it the best I can. 
 

 Over the past few years, which probably started around 5-6 years ago. I've developed a more severe case of it. I get scared and my body breaks down whenever I'm in something I can't get out of easily. Lines, waiting queues, Movie Theaters, hairdressers, meetings, buses, trains, boats and especially PLANES.
 

 The best I can explain it is, I start to shake a little, I feel faint, dizzy, then the stomach cramps kick on. Which causes nausea, which makes my heart race more, stomach cramps increase, and sometimes vomit. 
 

 This started when I had to visit my LDR boyfriend in America, I'm Australian so the flights were 18hrs +. We are no longer together but that was when this version if my anxiety started and I don't know how to handle it. 
 

 I have to catch a plane tomorrow for 2 hours, and then a train for 3 more hours and I'm terrified. I'm worried I'm going to freak out, scream, cry, vomit and potentially soil myself. 
 

 Any advice for this type of thing would be greatly appreciated. I'm a bit scared of therapy and they're expensive. I went when I was little and ended up getting anxiety GOING to therapy. 
 

 Please and thank you"
"For context, I (26f) am working for a big american company, as an administrative assistant for 1 year and 4 months. This is not my dream job and definitely I am overqualified for it, but I settled for it because it was nicely paid. 
 

 In the first year, I was working alone as my other colleague (40f) was on maternity leave, she has been in the company for 6 years already and she was planning to come back this august.
 

 After she came back she was promoted as my manager and here is where things started to go downhill. The tasks would be the same for both of us, only that she was considered to have more seniority and hence she deserved a promotion and a raise, which I had no problem with. But I had to report to her from now on.
 

  She said that we would be flexible and we will help each other to make all tasks easier, but in the last 2 months I feel like I am going insane with the things she is doing. She changes my shift all the time and takes the one from earlier (we have 2 shifts - one from 8-16pm and the other from 11-19 pm), her kids are always sick and she cannot come to the office and announces me on a very short notice like “you need to be there tomorrow morning, this needs to be done asap”,etc. Sometimes I end up staying both shifts. When she was alone and I was wfh because I asked beforehand, the next day she would complain that the work was too hard at the office and she couldn’t handle it even though I would help her from home. Which eventually led to me not working from home anymore.
 

 Lately she does not respect shifts at all and told me “you can come on each shift you want but i will be here from 9 to 15 cause I have to take my kids to school”. She keeps saying that I am young and I have no responsibilities and she feels entitled to always give me a lot more tasks than she does herself.
 At first I was very understanding as I dont have kids and can understand how difficult it could get, but she skips work so often and I am supposed to cover all the gaps in the time frame that it got me so stressed and anxious.
 

 In the last 2 months I went to the ER 3 times with panic attacks and now the problem has gotten worse, as I have dizziness, strong headache and neurological symptoms. Went to the doctor and they put me on medical leave and would need to do some tests. I announced my colleague and she got all mad, telling me that I should have refused the medical leave as she refused it herself a few days ago, when she bruised her arm (she doesn’t have a fracture but she fell on her arm). She asked me to take my laptop and work on my medical leave as she cannot use her both hands and made me feel again, guilty for being sick. She belittles all my symptoms and says that I should handle myself alone, with OTC medication and come to the office.
 

  I feel like this is unfair and like I have no space to rest, like I should feel guilty that being so burnout made my nervous system go nuts. My doctor advised me to rest and do some tests and eventually to quit this job and get out of this situation.
 

 Am I over reacting? I really cannot believe that she also asked for my medical records when this is not her business, as those medical records have to go to HR.
 

 Reddit, what do you think I should do?"
I am resigning from my job. I am not happy with it. I literally cry while I walk to my office. I got selected for another position in a different company with some pay raise but I did it for the sake of it because I need to be financially stable. But I feel so clueless. This uncertainty kills me. I planned everything and I know that sometimes plans don't work but I feel like I have no idea what I want to do. I am 26 and I don't know where I want to go professionally. My entire academic ls feels like a waste.

"I'm 27 and been having social anxiety since age 9, with very little progression in life. I feel like I'm the same exact person I was when I was 15, but angrier. I've never been in a relationship, I don't have any friends, I can't talk to anybody at work, I can't speak when I'm in front of a group of people, I'm depressed, and I have super low self esteem. Everytime I walk by a girl I think is cute I want to talk to, I look down as hard as I can and hope she doesn't notice me. This shit is crazy.
 Thus, this is why I bring up the use of MDMA. Here's my theory. From my understanding it can break me out of my shell completely, and all those barriers I have when Im around people go down for just a moment. I feel like this could help me as a way to practice. In like a party, or concert or other social setting, if I'm rolling, I'll most likely interact with anyone I want, be able to express myself, have amazing experiences, and in the process learn more about who I am. I feel like I have no personality, because I never interact with people, and when i do, i dont show emotion, but am a trainwreck internally and can't hold a conversation. But the MDMA can help me learn who I am, and understand social interactions more, so when I'm no longer feeling the drugs effects, I'll have more to fall back on when I'm talking to people, as opposed to next to nothing like I do right now. That's just an idea I have, and I'm feeling like this is the only way to cure myself right now."
Looks like there are many people who are interested. I won’t be posting any links here as self promotion is not allowed but let me know if you are interested.
"Hey I hope you are well!
 

 I just wanted to be heard because I feel like I can't talk to anyone about this so I'm here to tell hundreds of strangers on the internet. The thing is that tomorrow I have a trip from Friday to Monday because of a wedding and I feel very nervous, honestly I don't want to go, I don't want to leave my house or my city. I am 29 years old! I'm supposed to enjoy traveling to a new place and weddings parties, but no, instead here I'am worried and anxious because I don't want to go, I just want to stay home for the weekend with my dog and watch a movie, see my parents and on Monday return to work as if nothing had happened. has it happened to you? What have you done to make it better? See you later, I hope everyone has a good weekend."

 Hi, i'm new here, I don't know where to start. I don't even know if I do ok posting this here. Anyway. I Assume that I'm anonymous, so should be ''easy""
 

 In life I just don't know how to interact with pple. I know a lot of pple, I've met many in my life. But I'm 29 years old now, and don't have any close friends. When I start to talking to someone that I may be like because of their personality etc. I have great difficulties to be open, or like I don't know, I don't text first, it take me all that i got to do so. It becomes obsessive when I don't have reply etc.
 

 I just don't know how to make friends, to make friends with same value as me, who like to be with me and vice versa. I think that I'm not interesting enough. I think that its not worth talking to someone who are not very well.. Even on the internet I have difficulties express myself.. Irl its even worse.  
 

 

 I don't go out meet new pple, or even date, I have huge difficulties with my self image, and this is something that I don't want is to trust too many pple to tell why i'm like that etc etc.
 

 I've lost so many friendships... I don't now why directly... but unfortunately I'm a girl  
 and I lie better with guys than girls . It's like that I cant do anything about that. I did have good female friends, but its very very selective. I have great difficulties of trusting someone too..
 

 It's been couple of day I feel like crap because of all this. I just seen someone to talk, but its never rihjt. I better be alone. Its hard to think like that. 
 

 I try to do things that can distract me from my thoughts, but it's always here, always want to cry, always have to hide.."
I think I’m realizing that will have some sort of communication with other people. I’ve been door dashing for the past few years and I’m done running my car to the ground. I used to be a caregiver and that was probably my favorite job since it was one on one. What other jobs are there it’s good for people who are socially anxious? I really need to get my life together..
"I'm in a very bad state and i feel like i don't have the power to fight against my struggles myself, hence why i'm looking desperately for a therapist.
 My bf has depression and he always tells me how he was able to manage to deal with his depression himself and he truly believes i'm the only one who can change my problems too. He doesn't think that getting therapy would really do anything and i need to go against my trauma and anxiety myself. He says that i don't even try to fight against my issues and that i rely on getting therapy out of comfort so that i don't have to do anything and others will fix my problems. I don't feel like this is true.
 We talked about how we are not the same person and just because it worked for him doesn't mean it works for me.."

"Monday evening, I (29f) went to a speed dating event. I've never done anything like it. I've never even voluntarily kissed somebody. People scare me. Adult men especially scare me. 
 

 I went with a beta blocker and a little bit of vodka in my system. I was waaay too sober, though. I came in late (I'm terribly chaotic) and left immediately afterwards instead of staying and chatting like I'd planned. I was a nervous wreck! They all noticed and it was a painful evening. It was exhausting to have to talk for 5 minutes to 17 different men. 
 

 The men were fine, normal young men, but only 4 of them ticked yes on me. For a woman, that's a pretty horrible score. Men aren't known for being picky while speed dating. Now I'm wondering how big of a role my atrocious social skills played or if it was mostly about my looks. 
 

 I received 2 matches. One is with a guy I don't remember and haven't heard from, and one with a guy I'm not physically attracted too, but he has an adorable dog and fun personality. The second guy and I started exchanging messenges yesterday. I asked if he remembered who I was or should I send a photo. We exchanged pictures and then he ghosted. I threw away his number and I'll try another event in a few weeks. 
 

 On one hand I'm very proud of myself for finally starting my dating adventures. On the other hand, I've never felt more ugly. So, mixed feelings. 
 

 Ever tried speed dating? Let me hear your stories!
 

 

 Oh, a little side story: the woman next to me was apparently hilarious because I could hear her laughing all evening. Afterwards, right before I left, I made a little joke to her (with very low volume as I'm not a loud person), and she proceeded to loudly retell my joke 10 seconds later in front of me to the guys at her table as if it was hers. The woman I'd secretly admired all night was actually nothing but a common joke thief! It was the biggest disappointment of the night."

"When I was a kid I made friends simply by asking if they wanted to play, but after going through an adolescence where girls always bullied me, I became the most antisocial person possible. I have no friends because I could never make friends as an adult, I'm 26 years old, I don't look like an adult because of how I look, I feel like I'm destined to fail in this world because I've never been able to develop a normal personality like any other adult, for me to be an adult is to be silent and listen."
"I(f26) love my boyfriend(28), he's genuinely the best thing that's ever happened to me and because of that I hate I'm feeling right now. 
 

 I've had social anxiety for as long as I could remember, i used to think I was just shy but I can do my activities (like dancing) with no bother, but once it gets to social aspects of things, I want the ground to swallow me up, I have no idea of how to act or what to say. I remember being slightly more social before the pandemic, this was mostly due to working in an office (where I met my boyfriend) and living in a house with 10+ roommates. When the pandemic hit, self isolating was very easy for me, especially as my job became remote. I was in my own little bubble and fear of COVID made me even more weary of socializing. There was 18 months total of very strict lockdown and social distancing in my country and I was also quite strict about this. My boyfriend I began dating near the middle of this pandemic and due to a lot of his friends being high risk or living with high risk family members, he didn't really hangout with them. Also with the rules being so strict there weren't any instances where we would be in social situation outside of the two of and maybe his friend who was also his roommate.
 

 Fast forward to the end of 2021 and more social functions start happening and now suddenly I get to see what he's like around other people and honestly I was shocked. He comes across as a homebody, doesn't like many outdoor activities and I don't see him talk to people on the phone very often, just a group chat on twitter with his close friends. But when we would go to a gig or a party he turns into the most outgoing and talkative person. He's so warm and inviting, naturally funny and is great at relating to others. 
 

 I hate to say thing but I instantly felt envy and jealousy. I didn't know if it's because he left my side to go socialize (what a crime!) Or because of how easy and natural it seemed for him, maybe both. I on the other hand found myself with even less social skills and an even lower social battery than before. I would leave pretty much every event early or not go at all. Watching how easy it is for him fills me up with so much unease, I was never expecting that to be an issue. It's 2022 now and not one friend lives close to me so I feel like I'm constantly relying on him for company, so when he has gatherings to attend I feel even worse because I'm just thinking about how much fun he's having and when I'm there all I can notice is the stark difference in our demeanor and personalities. And it's not that I don't like going out, I just get anxious before leaving, the I don't know what to do when I'm there and I freeze until I let myself escape the situation, then end up feeling shit about it.
 

 I wish I was different, depression already sucks but who would of thought social anxiety would make me feel envious and almost resentful of my amazing boyfriend for being social."
"I (M28) have always pictured myself as an extremely introverted person, loving staying at home on Friday evenings just painting. This suited me well, because I also have social anxiety. 
 

 Recently I started working in a new job. Sometimes this is hard on my social anxiety, but I'm beginning to feel settled and safe with my coworkers, which helps. My coworkers are very nice, especially the two girls I share an office with. I find myself enjoying talking to most of my coworkers, even wanting to hang out with many of them when we're off work.
 

 I don't have much experience being social, or making new friends. And this new social setting has me questioning whether I'm really introverted, or if it's just the social anxiety that has alway been in control, convincing me that I don't need social interaction. 
 

 This new situation and these new thoughts has started getting me depressed. I don't enjoy my hobbies anymore; painting, taking pictures. I feel like I'm missing out on so much social stimulation. And I barely have any friends. And I have no idea how or where to make new friends, or how to make friends out of my coworkers. And I feel like the social anxiety is always going to be there, because it has always been there, making obstacles for me, so that I can't talk to people, so that I can't make new friends. And thinking about this, in addition to being 28 and feeling like time is running out, has me more and more depressed.
 

 The idea that time is running out, is because I have a girlfriend and we've been together for 6 years. We will probably get married in a few years, get kids, and the time of having the time to make new friends and hang out with them will probably be over soon. My girlfriend is of little to no support in this matter by the way. She doesn't believe in smaller mental health problems, like anxiety. Or she doesn't understand them, or doesn't want to understand. It's a huge red flag, i know. But what can you do, when everything else in the relationship is good?
 

 I have been venting now, and this post is long. I feel a little better after writing this all down, I haven't tried that before. If you have any experience or suggestions, I'd be delighted if you'd share them. If not, then I'm happy you've read through this entire post. Have a nice day :)"
"I get way more anxious when I switch my attention from one thing to another until I get settled in on whatever that new thing is. So from going to from my phone to drawing I get anxious and often go back to the phone for some time and then try again. This can also happen when going from one room to another or things like that. I also need to be constantly focusing on something or become anxious. I'm almost always on my phone at this point, my iPhone says I spend ten hours a day on average.
 

 Does anybody know about this?"
"Hi y’all, I (25 M) work in higher ed and make roughly $45k a year salary and have a Bachelor’s degree. I make enough in my current situation to save and have some spending money here and there.
 

 I’ve got no debt, live at home and have a stable relationship. Yet I can’t help but compare myself to my peers and friends who are making more than me. There are plenty my age who make less and just as many who make more and every time I learn of their salaries, I just get so insecure about my income. 
 

 I go on spirals of why I’m not there yet and how I’m always going to be stuck making below the $50k mark forever. Now I’m not desiring to be a millionaire just make enough money to where we can have a safety cushion if things go bad and/or afford a modest vacation once or twice a year. 
 

 Yet I’m always so insecure and anxious about never making it out of this income bracket. Which is crazy because just 3 years ago I was working for Walmart making $11.25/hr 
 

 Anyone have any advice to just not care about other’s lives?
 

 TL;DR: How do I stop comparing myself to others and feeling small when I find out close friends make more money than me?"
"Hi all! My first post here after lurking for a while :)
 

 tl;dr: How do you deal with recovery, when realizing that the ""recovered life"" still contains a lot of pain because life is a mix of ups and downs? How do you deal with the fear of just sitting with these emotions and accepting them?  
 

 

 A little back story:
 

 I (25F) have been dealing with anxiety since about 2017 when I was 20y/o.
 

 It has gone up and down over the years but in June of this year (2022) I had a major setback after an oral exam at the end of a very stressful semester, and in some ways my anxiety became worse than ever before. Specifically, I have generalized anxiety and panic disorder and worry about absolutely everything, most times fearing getting a panic attack in different situations, and get a lot of really bad physical symptoms, including (but not limited to) debilitating nausea, dizziness, shaking and insomnia.
 

 I have tried \*a lot\* of different therapy types (also alternative medicin) and medications and have now, after the breakdown in June, found a therapy form (metacognitive therapy) that seems to be actually working for me (fingers crossed). At least I see progress like I've never seen before.
 

 So now I am kind of beginning to see a way ""out"" of anxiety and a way to actually live my life.
 

 The only thing is, that I am now learning that I have to truly accept my anxiety and that I will not always feel 100%. I am also learning that recovery is a process and a struggle and is **hard.**
 

 I know that it is probably naïve for me to not learn this before 5 years into my anxiety journey, and in some ways I have always logically known it, but not really accepted it - and I think I have kept hoping for a magical recovery and a cloud 9 type of existence where everything is easy.
 

 So now I'm going through an actual grieving period where I have to realize, that the life I imagined (everything being fine all the time) is not the life that I am going to have. And I get a lot of anxiety and hopelessness about ""what is the point?"" if life still can feel like sh\*t sometimes even though you are fully recovered?
 

 So I'm just wondering: What have been your experiences with dealing with recovery grief and coming to terms with accepting anxiety and life as it is? How do you keep fighting for recovery, when the future kind of seems unmanageable?"
"Hi everyone,
 

 Today is a HUGE WIN. I'm (M25) a medical student who has had severe health anxiety since 2013. I specifically have a phobia of getting my blood pressure checked, and as a result of that every time I went to the physician in high school my BP was insane (I've seen &gt;200/120 before). This phobia is so severe that I haven't seen a doctor since 2014. Since then, I frequently have anxiety about my high blood pressure numbers in the past, and wondering if I could be at risk for complications like a heart attack, stroke, etc.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Now that I'm in medical school and constantly reminded of the importance of blood pressure, I decided it's time to take action. Today, after two months of work, I finally looked at my blood pressure number and it was... **completely normal**. I've spent so many years with a crippling fear of high blood pressure, and a whole bunch of anxiety, related to it. To finally have the mental fortitude to take my own blood pressure and look at the numbers is one of the most gratifying things I have ever done.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Everyone's journey through health anxiety is different, but things I've done are:
 

  \- Obtained a therapist to talk about my anxiety
 

  \- Attempted to transform my cognitions around health anxiety and getting my blood pressure checked (cognitive behavioral therapy)
 

  \- Reminded myself that, even if I do have a medical condition like hypertension, I don't need to be anxious about that because it's very common. Rather, I need to maintain control over my health.
 

  \- Decreased anxiety in my daily life from other causes.
 

  \- Most importantly: Exposure therapy. I have been checking my blood pressure multiple times most days for the past two months, but with the screen covered. Over time, my body stopped feeling the ""fight-or-flight"" sensation when putting the cuff on, and now I am much more relaxed when checking my blood pressure at home.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 **This journey was scary as it required me to directly tackle my biggest fear. But the harder the journey, the more rewarding the outcome.**"
"I remember the summer 4 years ago. It was World cup 2018. I was with my friend and his gf watching a game outside of crowded pub. Thats when shaking and trembling voice started and big waves of fear coming over me. That was my last time going out. I remember hating our team winning because everybody would be so happy. I always would cheer for the opposite team. To make matters worse my country got into finals.lol. 
 

 Since then I have been only going to work and back home. Keep in touch with only few of my friend and we would always meet up at my place. My social life became a disaster. 
 

 I contracted covid in feb this year. And I started having such intense waves of panic attacks that I was forced to go into mental facility 3 times this year. Things got better but SA stayed. But since I am still suffering from major fatigue life has been really isolating. 
 

 I attended my friends bachelor party, wedding, basketball tournament and some minor things. On the wedding I was shaking for straight hour before it stopped while my best friend helped me calm down. I am still unable to work and that was my only way of communicating with ppl. 
 

 Yesterday I went with my mother on a walk in the evening on the main square at the city and I lt triggered a major anxiety attack. I hate myself for not being able to do basic things. I cried for a good hour before calming down a little bit.I also lay down with my mother in bed a little bit while she calmed me down. Mind you I am 25 yo man 6 foot 4 240 lbs. It reminded me of that short movie Dennis where a huge bodybilder after a night out comes home to sleep with his mother in bed. 
 

  Everytime I try to combat this deamon another part of me dies. Idk I have a therapy session in january I hope that will help. 
 

 I also think that one girl is interested in me but everytime I come into contact with here I just freez and try to look like I dont care. 
 

 I cant going like this being isolated from the world but also it so hard to tackle this thing. All the shaking, not feeling good in your own skin, having waves of fear coming over you. Its disgusting. One guy at the wedding saying I saw you shaking a lot. That really hurt. 
 

 Today was 2022 world cup match where my team won again.lol.
 

 Idk just trying to vent and connect with anyone thats willing to do so. Peace. Hope someone reads this."
"I reached out to this person cause I cared so much about them and I got to see them and everything but getting treated the same way by this person wasn’t what I wanted for myself. I replay everything that always happens when I see them and then later on or in the next few days they treat me like I don’t exist.. respecting how things are with them but just hate dealing with it because I know I don’t deserve it. Ima just walk away quietly and when they reach out just basically give them the same energy they give me.. 
 

 Cause I feel like that’s all I can do in this situation.."
"I (26F) am someone who is extremely shy/ timid and a bit awkward, so I relate to a lot of these posts often. I find it difficult to socialize with extroverts and those that are outgoing because I can't match their energy. I feel drained when interacting with someone who has high energy and talkative (not their fault). I have been thinking lately of a way to put myself out there and find a way to meet with other people who have SA. I think it would be good for us as we all struggle with something very similar and will be nonjudgmental of each other. This will be a way for us to get out of our shells as well and practice putting ourselves out there. I've also read a lot of posts of some of us feeling lonely, I think this will be an amazing way to feel like a part of something and not feel so alone all the time. This will be a safe space for us to be ourselves with no expectations. Just be yourself. 
 

 I love the idea of eventually turning it into in-person get-togethers to do things like hiking, lowkey house get-togethers, or game nights. I will update this post if anyone is interested, including my email, and arrange a meeting. I feel that no one will understand me better than those who experience the same thing as me. I also think we can help each other get out of this struggle somehow and if somehow is in a dark place I hope we can somehow help each other get out of it. There is nothing wrong with us. I believe we just haven't found our niche. One love. &lt;3"
"Hello! I've been dealing with a few Gastrointestinal issues these past months. I have a bit of reflux, constipation, bloating, etc .. whats worrying me a LOT now is sometimes I feel a knot/pressure on the upper mid abdomen.. sometimes it feels a bit like nausea but it's not like I'm about to vomit... 
 Here's the thing. I pressed around in that area to see what it feel like, if there was any pain, or anything weird going on, and I felt something. Like a squishy lump? It's located right on the upper mid abdomen, in between where the ribs end, and a bit to the left... A friend who's a doctor told me it's the end part of the breastbone, but I'm not really convinced and he's tired of me, so I can't ask much ..
 I don't know if this is normal, don't know if I always had it. I'm scared of it being a tumor... But if it was, wouldnt I have much worse symptoms? Wouldn't I be vomiting?.. I mean, if it's big enough to feel it, I would be basically vomiting blood... Am I wrong? I'm scared this is what's causing my issues, altough I don't know how something up there could be causing soft stools or bloating...
 I'm terrified it's esophageal or stomach cancer.
 Sorry for the long post"

"Hello fellow sleepless friends. **TL;DR** at the bottom, I’m grateful for any and all feedback! Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile.
 

 I’ve (F28) found myself awake and in a panic just 2 hours after finally falling asleep (it is currently around 6:25am where I’m located). 
 

 I’ve been having some mental health issues for a while now, some pretty intense depression, anxiety, PMDD, C-PTSD, all tons of fun when coupled with lifelong insomnia. My Dr. has prescribed me Setraline (Zoloft) that I’ve worked up to 125mg from 50mg over the last month, with the intention of going a bit higher. I also started Hydroxyzine (Atarax) 25mg that I can take up to three times a day for anxiety as well as insomnia at night (though I’ve found it’s not very effective for the type of anxiety I have and often take it just once to help with the insomnia). Most recently Prazosin (2mg) was added to the mix to help with the nightmares.
 

  I began taking the Prazosin 2 nights ago and just woke up from a HORRIBLE, vivid nightmare worse than anything I’ve had in months. I’m used to weird, lucid-type dreams, sleep paralysis, and nightmares that wake me up in a panicked cold sweat. This was a different animal and even had a sort of inception-y nightmare within a nightmare aspect. Would not recommend.
 

 I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar reaction. I actually have a call with my Dr. in a few hours anyway, so of course I’ll mention it to her, but I just can’t stop wondering wtf is wrong with my brain. War Vets who have seriously terrifying PTSD can be helped by this but I, someone who has been lucky to never see combat or anything close to it, get worse? I’d really just love to hear anyone’s take on this; please send any questions, comments or recommendations my way! 
 

 

 **TL;DR:** Took Prazosin for second night in a row, had worst vivid nightmare I’ve had in months. Why is my brain so bad at being a brain and how do I fix it?!
 

 Thank you anyone who took the time to read this. It’s rough out here, I could definitely use a hand."
"I cant open my mouth and talk when having a conversation where I have to talk about things really personal, or defend/ explain myself, especially if it's something confrontational in nature. It feels like my mouth is clamped up and even though there are things that I want to say it's an extreme struggle to get any words out and I don't feel like I anything that I say makes sense and that people understand me. 
 I realized yesterday a part of that problem is that is very much a physical thing because I clench my jaw/ bite the inside of my lips when I'm really anxious and stressed. And I dont know how to stop doing it, and how to make myself talk.
 I'm 25 now but I think I've had this problem since i was a kid, I tried talking about it when I saw a councilor once a few years ago about anxiety but I dont think i was able to properly convey myself and i ended up not going back since i found the experience extremely uncomfortable (the councilor was very nice and patient and it wasnt her anything on her end). I find it much easier to express things in text, but it's not always possible to do that. I would very much appreciate any suggestions"
I never thought I was able to deal with what I’ve been dealing with.. I go back and fourth with myself every single day.. trying to make the best out of everything.. and I see that I’m the only one that’s hurting every single time and seeing that I have on one to fall back on and all I have is myself.. I wanna feel okay but how can I?.. every time when I think I’m making progress.. I see that some progress made isn’t enough.. and I’m back to feeling sad and alone..
"**For Context:** I've been dealing with mysterious health issues for years and along with that has come health anxiety. I'm convinced there's something going on with me but I have a history of obsessing over any unpleasant bodily sensations then going to the doctor only for them to find nothing out of the ordinary. Granted I don't think it's all in my head or completely rooted in the anxiety itself. I think physical things flare up and trigger the anxiety which then makes everything worse. In fact, just recently they finally found that some of my hormones were imbalanced and I'm now on medication for it. Not sure if it's working but that's not what I'm here to complain about today. I've recently had a flare up of something that I think is digestion related; wouldn't be surprised as I've always had digestion issues throughout my life. Knowing how I react when it comes to unpleasant physical sensations, I try really hard to just wait it out and see if I start to feel better on my own, especially since I have white coat syndrome and doctors visits amplify my anxiety 10 fold. 
 

 Recently I've discovered the plethora of at home tests you can do for various health things. There's food intolerance tests, there's full GI health tests, there's stress hormone tests, etc. As someone who hates going to the doctor but is still trying to figure out my issues so I can start living my life like a normal person again, these tests are really appealing. BUT as always there's a catch and that's money. These tests are hundreds of dollars and the only way insurance will cover any of them is if it's ordered by a doctor, which negates the whole don't-have-to-go-see-a-doctor upside to them. I just wish I could do a bunch of them without having to pay so much, for peace of mind and curiosity sake.
 

 Sometimes I feel like I'm so close to finally figuring out my issues and being able to live my life more normally. Literally any test could be the last one I'll need to figure why I keep feeling how I've been feeling and be able to fix or at least manage the problem. I'm so tired of being scared of my body and just being uncomfortable all the time. I'm tired of scary doctors visits. I want to move forward but without the stress of making yet another doctors trip and doing stressful tests there. Is that too much to ask? OTL"
Any outgoing extroverts here struggle with social anxiety?
"Every time I care for anyone or let anyone in I tend to get let down mostly.. and I don’t make excuses for these people anymore because half the time, they half way wanna be around me because of what I’m feeling I’m lost and just wanna be found by someone who will get it and see that I’m honestly hurting.."
"I am 26 male, I dont have desire to do anything, not even bad, my entire life I was doing the least possible just for food and very necessary things. Because, honestly I like the way I am and I don't want it to change. I don't like to get my family to interfer with this because they are very religious and I think they would only complicate my issue. I am hearby to ask you what do you suggest for me to do about this keeping in ur mind that I don't want to change, so please don't suggest me things about getting help and especially non free treatment, it's not a magic button, becuase it will only work If let it and I won't."
"I’ve suffered with anxiety for the majority of my life. It first started when I was about 7 years old and I’m 27f now. My anxiety has always been situational for the most part, except for the last 5-6 months it has been constant. I’ve developed anxiety over things that used to never bother me, such as driving, going to a store, eating at a restaurant, being too far from home, etc. I have had my medications readjusted like 4 different times over the last few months. I had been on Prozac 20mg for a couple of years and did perfectly fine with that - until this summer and something in me switched. My anxiety and panic increased tremendously, so my pcp switched me to pristiq. Well then I finally got referred to a psych and they put me on Paxil and did a genetic test on me. Turns out Paxil doesn’t metabolize well in my body so they put me back on Prozac 20mg and at todays appt they increased me to 40mg. This anxiety is giving me major depression. I can’t keep living like this. Something has got to give, I am borderline agoraphobic right now and I don’t understand why. Does anyone relate specifically to random severe anxiety? And how are you now?"
Do you guys feel that you don't have a plan? As in you are doing your daily shit but still feel clueless. It's not like you are sitting there and letting life happen to you. You are trying and figuring shit out but still going nowhere.
"Hello. I've been struggling for several years with social anxiety. I am currently taking some therapy classes but it doesn't seem to work. My question is simple: how can I make an Instagram account?
 

 \&gt; I don't think I look attractive. I had some girlfriends, but I don't find myself attractive at all. I always hated myself.
 

 \&gt; When I consider making an account, I always think people will consider me weird because I am 25 and I never had one before.
 

 \&gt; I don't really have any friends right now, so probably my number of followers will be around 0-10. It's also a big red flag for other girls. I think they will find it weird, probably weirder than saying: "" I don't have social media anymore"", as I say right now.
 

 \&gt; I never posted any pictures of myself, anywhere.
 

 So considering these problems, how can I make it? I don't think this post will really help me, but I will try this too, because it really affects me. I will read all the comments. Thank you!"
"My dose was increased about a week ago from 20 to 40mg. Since then, I have noticed a huge increase in my anxiety. Is this a normal experience? Does anyone else have a similar experience? I have always heard it can get worse before it gets better."
"I’ve (f25) dealt with anxiety for most of my life. I’ve been diagnosed for a few years now. But the past couple weeks I’ve had a strange feeling I’ve never experienced before. It started with a bad constant chest pain for a few weeks and then I started getting this mini “episodes” you could say. It is only for a split second and then goes away. The best way I can describe it is like when you go on a drop on a rollercoaster and your stomach drops and your whole body is tingly. It happens all throughout the day. I went to the ER and they said it was just anxiety, but I’ve never felt this sensation before."
"I often think that I don't love my partner enough. Or at least not in a way that she'd deserve. She's such a sweet and good person with great empathy, yet I see her looks and lack of intelligence and start worrying that I'm lying to her and to myself by being in this relationship. I constantly think about breaking up with my partner and start feeling strong anxiety (when thinking about breaking up). I then have intrusive thoughts like ""I'm only with her because I'm too scared of breaking up with her."" Is that relationship anxiety or is it fear of breaking up?"
"Recently my boyfriend (28M) of a year and I (26F) went from living together to long distance due to our work. At the beginning I missed him constantly but now I don’t and it makes me anxious. I work in a stressful work environment so one day I became extremely anxious about work about 2 months ago and from then every time I went to visit him I then became anxious around him. I started having thoughts about breaking up because the anxiety and panic attacks I’ve had have been absolutely debilitating, but when I actually go to break up it’s not what I want at all. I know the end is in sight for long distance, but I can’t stop the feeling of being so anxious thinking about him and how I might not be in love anymore. He’s the best boyfriend in the world, he is patient, understanding, and incredibly loving. Before this I believed and clearly saw marriage in sight. Now, I just want to curl up and never talk to anyone again. It pushed me to see a therapist to see what’s going on. I just can’t grasp losing him I love him so much but I also physically cannot think or be around him without extreme anxiety and I don’t know what to do anymore. I fear that this anxiety will never go away and it’ll block me from loving him."
"**TW:** Heart related symptoms, detailed panic attack experience, and specific bpm measurements
 

 **Disclaimer:** I've had quite a few heart related tests done. Multiple EKGs, bloodwork, CT scan, chest x-ray, 24-hour halter monitor, pretty sure I also had an echocardiogram done a while back too, and 2 brain MRIs. All came back normal.
 

 I've had this happen a few times before but it sucks so much each time. They always seem to happen at night and majority of the time I have no idea what triggers them, they seem to come out of nowhere. Last night was much the same. That morning even I had felt like I was doing better. My chest didn't feel as tight and I didn't feel quite as fatigued as I had been for the past week or so. 
 

 Come nighttime my heart skipped a beat and started feeling kind of fluttery (I've felt this way a number of times before and usually it doesn't amount to anything other than I just feel uncomfortable for a while). I got ready for bed and watched some youtube vids for a bit and felt more relaxed. Then I got up to go to the bathroom and it all went downhill from there. When I got back in bed my heart was a little racy and poundy. I figured after laying there for a bit it'd go away like it usually does. Wrong. I lied there for a couple hours and my heart just wouldn't relax. Didn't help that my back and neck were bothering me too (my bed isn't exactly the most cushiony). Every time I tried to adjust my position it would make my heart beat faster momentarily.
 

 I finally had enough and sat up thinking maybe I could talk myself down or something and that's when it really started to kick in. My heart rate went up to 151 bpm just while I was sitting on my bed. I felt out of breath and my chest felt really tight and achy. Obviously this freaked me out so I went upstairs and woke my parents up at around 2am(you know, just in case it turned into a medical emergency). Going up the stairs was exhausting. This has happened before so my parents kind of just chilled with me for a bit and not much longer after I sat up there my heart rate went back down to 130 bpm and I started getting the shakes. Wasn't cold just very shivery. So I went back down to my room with my mom and we kind of just hung out for a bit. My heart rate was back down to 98 by the time she left and it didn't feel that strong anymore(like the pounding was less). You'd think that'd be the end of it. It wasn't. 
 

 Lucky me, whether just coincidence or a consequence of me being hyper vigilant of my heart rate after that and feeling anxious about it, my heart rate went back up a little. Not nearly as much as before and wasn't as strong but it was still enough to keep me awake basically all night. If I had to guess I'd say it was in the lowish hundreds/high nineties but I had stopped checking it. Had the same issue where anytime I'd move my heart rate would increase momentarily. It sucked. 
 

 It's now morning and I'm really tired. I also have a mild headache, fun stuff. I get headaches/migraines pretty frequently so I'm not surprised. It was bothering me a little even before all this happened. My heart rate is still a little uncomfortable but I think that's partly because I'm worried about it now and obsessively thinking about/observing it. I think it's still a little high but luckily it's started dipping lower. Last time I measured it when I was feeling more relaxed it was 86 bmp which is definitely an improvement. My chest feels a little tight still but hard to say if that's soreness from it working so hard, sleep deprivation, or acid reflux(go figure, that's also been flaring up a lot more recently). 
 

 But yeah, sorry for the rant. It's been a rough night and I'm trying to alleviate my anxiety while also taking notes about what happened so I can look back and remember better in the future if I need to."
"I have had a revelation so many others have probably had but I think it's relevant to post to maybe help someone else out. 
 

 I, like many others, have no idea why I suffer from chronic anxiety and today I think I found out my problem for me. In my ""normal"" feel good, nothing wrong, life I experience what's likely ""normal"" levels of anxiety. I get sweaty for dates and my stomach turns for an interview. Other than that I'm pretty stable and even for the worst of anxious scenarios I'm not close to a panic or even anxiety attack. I feel like I can handle whatever comes my way. To give context, in my ""bad"" state during periods of chronic anxiety that can last a year or more, I can hardly feed my dog or lay in bed without being on the verge of breaking. 
 

 I've now had two of these ""bad"" states in my life. The first in college that lasted about a year from onset to full recovery and the second that started in August 2021 and I'm still working towards full recovery. Both of these times I had no idea what caused it. I went from functioning normally one day to feeling kinda gross the next to being catatonic a few weeks later. 
 

 So today I stumbled across an article that I'll link below that explained the connection not only from anxiety to muscle tension but also, most importantly to me, from muscle tension to anxiety. I now know that chronic stress can slowly increase your tolerance for muscle tension so you may not even notice it growing and compounding. Out of control muscle tension can buildup stress hormones and regular, totally normal, acids that when beyond your bodys tolerance can cause anxiety. 
 

 For me the first time I had chronic anxiety enter my life I was entering my junior year of college. The summer before I was working a factory job about 45 minutes from home and rotating first, second, and third shifts as a temp. I was also doing a set schedule internship. I would work 60+ hours a week for 4 months which in itself isn't terrible but working days twice a week for the internship and then days, evenings, or nights every other available day for the factory was a lot and destroyed my sleep schedule. I had no days off and no time at home that wasn't spent sleeping. I also had other stressors in the back of my head like the upcoming junior year capstone and my first real apartment. Anyways, this second time was comparable too because I had a relationship end and another start and end along with leaving one secure job for another startup on top of a loved one dying and working out 6 days a week for 2 hours. On top of that I took an lsat exam and was passed by for a promotion that was mine. Both times I had a slow buildup of stressors and never really gave myself relief because I didn't feel like I needed to. I felt completely fine. Then very quickly I wasn't. 
 

 What happened to me and what I suspect happens to many people who don't know why they suffer from anxiety is this slow buildup and tolerance of muscle tension that, as explained in the article, leads to a chemical buildup that eventually your body can't keep up with. You then start having regular psychological anxiety that in turn feeds more muscle tension which feeds more psychological anxiety which feeds more..... And what's fucked up is I'll feel completely fine, unstressed and good, until my body can't keep up. Personally, and this may happen to others, I then slip into health anxiety because I have no apparent reason for feeling this way. It's a dark spiral that I can't explain to a therapist because I don't know what's going on or how the hell I got here. 
 

 I do now though. For me it's the chicken that came before the egg, the muscle tension that leads to anxiety. I fancy myself as one of those hard working lay it on me I can handle it types and for a while I can be but I need to learn my breaking point. 
 

 Hope this helps someone as lost as I was.

"Hi, 
 

 I (M28) started my current job about 6 months ago. From the beginning, I have been thrown into the deep end with tons of assignments and right deadlines, meetings with coworkers and clients, and the usual staying late/working through my lunch (if I even get one) 
 

 It’s a lot, and stressful but I kinda take solace in the fact that it’s fully remote so I can avoid the added stress of being in person and having to deal with commuting.
 

 Anyway, there’s this huge event happening this month and being that I’m local to where it will be taking place, my boss asked me if I could go. I won’t lie, I knee jerk reaction said yes thinking it was remote only to find out it was actually in person.
 

 After some thought I figured I should go since professionally it might be best. But, my boss has the tendency to throw people into things and put them on the spot during client calls (which I haven’t been on many so far) Nothing bad like calling you out on anything.  
 

 She tends to want your input and want you to converse with the client and bring ideas into the meeting. I’ve done my best in the past but this will be in front of multiple clients and I (as an anxious person) am dreading it. It’s been wearing on me for a couple weeks now and I feel like I’m on the verge of an anxiety attack. I know I won’t sleep the night before which makes my mental health worse in situations like this. So, I don’t really know what to do other than to tell her I don’t want to speak. 
 

 It’s tough because I’ve kinda hinted at that in meetings with my other boss and project manager but they seem to just say “oh it would be fine though.”
 

 My boss, tends to be impatient and want things immediately so I’m not exactly sure how she might take my saying “I don’t want to present this project because X” 
 

 Any advice?
 

 TL;DR There is a huge event for a client that my company was invited to. I was roped into it and now I’m feeling super anxious and overwhelmed by the idea of possibly having to present this project to the client. What do I do?"
"29F here. I've been on anti-depressents on and off for 14 years and I still can't seem to find the cure for my underlining anxiety. I have been on quite a few and finally managed to find one that really helps with depression but I still have anxiety. I see a therapist who is great and I recently got diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Ritalin which my doctor, therapist and psych all thought would eliminate my generalized anxiety but it didn't. If anything it made me worse. Writing this post has taken me hours to write as it's a constant stream of over thinking and punishment on what people might think of me or the way I put things into writing. 
 As long as I can remember I've had anxiety and It's always lingering subconsciously.. I avoid most things in case it rears it's ugly head. My question is: Has anyone been like me and managed to find a medication that has eliminated this? I've lived with it for a long time so have found a way to manage but I've had snippets of what life is like anxiety free and I want it all the time!
 

 Some things I avoid or can't do: 
 

 -Socialize. I avoid people as much as I can which I hate because I have a love for hospitality and working with people. I currently work as a Bartender so have people skills but it still is constant stream of overthinking when I'm at work. I have no friends because anytime I get close to someone I can't keep the friendship going due to avoidance. 
 

 -Making or taking phone calls. I will not answer nor make phone calls unless absolutely necessary and I always have a period of heavy anxiety afterwards. I pace when I'm on the phone and have to really focus to take things the other caller is saying.
 

 -Procrastinating. I literally will put anything off in case it triggers me.
 

 I also have Trichtillomania and pull my eyelashes and eyebrow hairs out from time to time. 
 

 I'm currently taking 150mg of Venlafaxine and Valium when needed."
"I’m just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m 28F but I have a voice of a 5 year old. My SA doesn’t help either. It makes me constantly mispronounce words and my voice becomes even more shakier. People just burst out laughing, even at work.
 

 Any advice? Anyone went through something similar? I just don’t know how to make my voice deep or make my anxiety go away :("
"I'm always very self conscious about creating attention for myself. One of the ways this manifests is when I go out and start to become well known to others. If I start going to a place enough times to the point the people in the store start to recognize me, I stop going and find a new place. After a while if I start to become a regular at the other place, I'll go back to the old place. I will literally rotate between grocery, convinience stores, fast food restaurants, coffee shops, and even weed shops so I don't become a recognizable face in those places. This is now manifesting to socializing as well.
 

 I've recently started going to meetup events as a way to try to get out and be social. I rotate through a few groups and their events but there's this one group who consistently holds events every single week. Since I have no other social life and pretty nothing else to do ever, I've been going to all of their events without missing any. There are several regulars in this group but even those regulars can't come to every event. Since I've been going to every event, I'm starting to become recognized one of the more loyal regulars. I've had people comment to me, ""Hey, I see you all of the time here!""
 

 As expected, I'm now starting to become self conscious about this. I'm starting to get anxiety and am overthinking everything. Some thoughts that come up are ""I'm becoming known as a regular, are they getting the hint that I have no social life so I come here all of the time?"". ""Are these people figuring out that I'm a loner with little friends?"". ""Do these people think that I have too much time on my hands so I just come here all of the time?"" 
 

 Because of these thoughts, I've recently been skipping some of their events. I skipped an event last week and plan on skipping several more events upcoming. I'm not skipping every single event, but now only going to events that actually interest me instead of forcing myself to go to every one. I'm also thinking of trying to take a temporary haitus for a few weeks. Man, why the fuck am I like this? Why can't I just be a normal human being? I know overthinking and no one cares or looks down on me about being a regular, but I just can't help it."
"Sure, it's easy enough to find people to meet up with who want to date or who have other intentions but finding people who just want to hang out, go to events or just do something fun together every now and then is wayyyy harder. And even more so as you get older! Even MORE so if you have health conditions etc that prevent you from going to work/education or if you simply don't go out much for any other reason. 
 I'm guessing an app like this doesn't exist because as a society we seem to value romantic relationships over platonic ones? Either that or people have usually already found their friend group by now from school work etc and have no desire to find new friends. Or maybe none of those reasons at all haha I have no idea but it would be nice"
"I'm eventually going to get over this and call them anyways. But fuck, out of all the things they let you set up an appointment for online, my provider doesn't let you set up mental health counseling online. I hate making phone calls."
"I don’t think I actually want to vent about it, just wanted to write it somewhere you know? I’ve (26f) been with my middle school sweetheart (27m) for 16 years. I planned on spending the rest of my life with him. But lately, no matter what I do, he seems distant. 
 My anxiety tells me every minute that I’m doing something wrong and pushing him away. Maybe he doesn’t need me anymore and just doesn’t want to hurt me. He has a hard time expressing how he feels too.
 I know he loves me because he cares about me deeply. Maybe I’m overreacting and we’re just in a slump. I just don’t know what to do.
 I’ve never dated anyone else. I’ve been with him almost the majority of my life. I don’t know what I’m going to do without my best friend.
 If I lose him, I feel like I’m going to be losing a huge part of me.
 I feel helpless.
 Thanks for listening."
"As title says, I've recently developed a death/health anxiety after a medication issue that put me into a panicked state for 9 days. I can't enjoy TV anymore as mentions or age/health/death distress me. I hate it as I used to love chilling out with a movie at night. It's always on my mind now. I'm starting medication in hopes it'll help asyhis has been ongoing for nearly 2 months and I can barely function."
"I hung out with some people I got to know through meetup events over the past few months. I'm not very outgoing and social, but I'm trying to take steps to fix it. Today, as I was going about my day, one of the friends said I was ""too nice"" after I gave a compliment on her new sweater that she bought when we were out. 
 

 I've been called too nice my entire life and I know it's not meant as a good compliment. It comes from the fact that I do everything to avoid conflict and don't like making people upset. I go out of my way to be overtly nice to people because I'm scared of upsetting them. I'm sick and tired of being call this and it ruined my entire night when I got home.
 

 I don't know how to behave in any other way. It was just how I was raised. My family gave me so much verbal and emotional abuse as a kid that I do everything I can not to make people mad. Whenever I wouldn't help someone out bring groceries home and just sat down, they would yell at me and call me lazy. Whenever I was being yelled at, I was never allowed to talk back and stand up for myself. I was always terrified of upsetting my family so I tried my best to avoid any confrontation.
 

 I can't do this anymore. Why am I like this? Why did my life have to be like this? I've been holding back on going to therapy for so long but I think this might be the straw. I'm tired of being too nice. How can I fix this? I just hope therapy gives me a solution."

"I struggle alot with anxiety and extremely low self esteem, however I have some very conflicting behaviour.
 

 

 E.g I can be terrified in terms of applying for a job but moving alone to another country that I have never been to is no problem.
 

 Scared my tutor might dislike me but don't mind taking the blame for a noise complaint sent to our neighbouring flat which are also my class mates because my friend who sent the complaint didn't want to be disliked."
"I have anxiety, and sometimes I wonder if I read into things too much. A while ago I posted here about my boyfriend who I grew concerned about that drinks too much. Enough so I was worried about him being an alcoholic. This was back in early February.
 

 Since then, he has given up alcohol - but not permanently. It’s more of a temporary fix because of my anxiety. Frankly, I don’t have an issue if he drinks when he’s seeing his friends that live far away, because they see getting drunk as “fun”. But he hasn’t been doing that.
 

 At the end of April, his friend who lives several hours away is having a get together party. He hasn’t been drinking for several months, and has been just fine, which helps quell my fear a bit of him being an alcoholic. I think if he limits his over the top drinking to these few get together celebrations that on the weekend, it would be okay.
 

 We’re moving soon, thank God, and he’ll be a bit farther from his friends which will make for fewer get together, but the get together a will actually be worth the celebration and not just having a party on the weekend. I don’t think I will ever understand the “fun” with drinking and parties. I clearly wasn’t that kind of person in college!
 

 I suppose in some ways I’m looking for validation that having one party in April will be fine. I don’t think he’s an alcoholic, because he genuinely has showed no issues with letting it go."
"I read an article and it says.. Face your fears, you will meet loyal people, it's a reflection of others.
 

 But how do one overcome it while in a relationship that potentially had situations in which this could have already happened or it may happen?
 

 How do one overcome this fear. The fear of being with a person which is a very low figure or a problematic person which may be cheating on me and even pretending everything is fine just for the sake of it? For the enjoyment or the thrill to fool me
 

 How can I overcome this?"
"I fear people close to me because I am scared they will reveal their true self and hurt me, use me for their pleasure that can range from the enjoyment of having control over me while cheating me, or the enjoyment of seeing me suffer, or the enjoyment of lying to me while faking completely what they are to me and what I am to them.
 

 So basically I fear that they just copy me or that they fake ""understanding"" or ""desiring to grow"" while they do things behind my back with malicious intentions. I basically fear malicious personalities.
 

 I don't really know how to escape once for all this fear"
"Hey I just wanted to know if anyone is struggling with the same issue. 
 

 (Obligatory „sorry for the formatting - I’m on mobile notice“) 
 

 I am not an introvert person, I’m rather extroverted, but I’ve got a general anxiety disorder and possibly social anxiety disorder aswell. 
 

 I (F27) am living with my partner (M31) in a small house. 
 

 I already have issues with his parents coming over from home to time. Not cause I hate them, but because they sometimes can be a little much, be picky about dust on the floor or small things. Also, I can only poorly communicate with them due to language barrier. 
 

 Now, I already managed to feel less anxious when they are around for short amounts of time, but them staying over night is blasting my anxiety right up. 
 

 Not only that but I can’t stand it if they are doing certain things like opening cupboards in the kitchen or going inside my bedroom. 
 

 Just last night I had a huge anxiety fallout cause my partners mom went through our bedroom to have a look at a new fitnessmachine we got. 
 

 I just feel like I’m going crazy. I can’t help crying and feeling terrified and anxious over such small things and I just want to know I’m not the only one with those unreasonable boundaries…"
"On Wednesday, I (26F) have my follow-up with my doctor after being on buspirone for 1 month. I don't feel as if it's helping enough, and if anything, it's making me more fatigued during the day and also makes me dizzy for about 2 hours after taking it (which can be killer for the days I'm working).
 

 I've struggled with anxiety/depression for quite a few years now. I've tried a number of things, other than antidepressants, for the symptoms I have (some days crazy anxiety, feel like I'm talking fast and not thinking before responding, have trouble concentrating, and then I feel like I crash from that on other days with extreme fatigue, no motivation, no desire to focus or get work done. I've tried ADHD medication (sometimes it made me more anxious, other times it felt like it did nothing at all), therapy, and checking vitamin/blood sugar/thyroid hormone levels.
 

 I've been obsessed over the past few days with researching if I should try something else, and I can tell my doctor is leaning towards starting me on SSRIs. These scare me because weight gain and sexual performance are things that already make me anxious. I also don't want to feel more fatigued than I already do. I wanted to try Buspar first since I assumed it was my built up anxiety causing the crashes and subsequent depression, but am now thinking that might not be the case.
 

 Any advice from someone who has gone through anything similar?"
"Someday's I just think way too much of what other's think of me but it gets to me so much that I go in a dark hole, and can't do normal routine tasks. I am feeling most of the time that I might say something to upset them and they might leave me. How do I manage these feelings? Without passing this feeling to someone else?"
"Hi, so this is my very first post on reddit so im kinda nervous but im rlly going crazy with me, myself and i.
 

 I (27F) have been in this relationship (27M) for almost 5 years now, we’ve been truly best friends for almost 8 years and he has always been into me until i said yes to dating and it has been amazing. However, i have anxiety and emotional dependence to him, whereas he has adhd and depression. 
 Due to my anxiety, i have these days every now and then where i almost show no love to him. Its not that i dont love him, it just feels as if days are passing by and i had no time to hug him or kiss him because i felt so drained, frustrated and so. I tell him i dont do it on purpose, but he feels exhausted too. 
 

 Its been like this many times and im starting to believe that maybe i dont really love him and that maybe its unfair to him for us to keep being together like this. And sometimes i start questioning myself if i really like him for who he is or is it just my dependence. But i dont know what to believe because when i think about breaking up i dont find myself strong enough to get through it."
"I'm 26. Never really drove much growing up so I developed a real fear of it. Started driving all the time the last few months and it got better. I was feeling confident and ready. I get into the car, show her the controls (minus the defrost bc I've never had to use it..). I start backing up, looking behind myself. Two people pop around the car next to me. I immediately stop and the woman shouts ""woah woah woah"". Told me I failed instantly. I feel very embarrassed. I literally didn't even get to start the test. I'm not even sure what I did wrong because I stopped when I saw them. I said ""ah goddammit, I took off work for this"" to myself. She snapped and said ""hey keep this professional. Don't use language like that"". It all felt very surreal being talked at like that but another adult. I'm going to retake it tomorrow somewhere else. But I feel super down about it all and it's increased my anxiety tenfold. Sigh. I just want it to be over.
 

 Update: Took my test again today at a different location and I passed! Only thing I lost points on was parallel parking. The proctor was super friendly. He noticed I had failed my previous test and the location. I mentioned I didn't have a very good time with the instructor and he said ""ah was it an old crotchety lady?"". I confirmed it was and he told me ""some people I know really should not be giving tests..."". Apparently she is notorious for being rude and ball busting throughout the entire city. Whew what a serious relief. It seems I can actually drive after all"
"25F here, last week I had mild symptoms and my rapid test came back positive. Few days of feeling absolutely terrible and very congested. However my anxiety felt fine. I was diagnosed with GAD last year and just tapered off of 20mg citalopram last month. Was feeling fine and now I'm on day 7 of being sick with COVID and I feel like I cant get enough air again. Constant breathing anxiety and nervous. I don't know why I feel this way again. My anxiety always seems breathing based. My first bout was because I felt like I couldn't take enough deep breaths or complete a yawn. I know this sounds silly. But it feels really scary right now and I'm just looking for support and others that have had this. I feel alone when I talk about my anxiety being breathing based and I'm wondering if anyone else has this."
"I've been searching for a job since I graduated from a masters program in Dec. The agency I interned(and currently work temporarily) kept telling me they would hire me, but I have yet to see an offer. Since then I've been offered a different position 4 hours from my hometown, in the city my girlfriend lives. But now the agency is coming through with an offer.
 

 I'm terrified and stuck in indecision. I should be happy but all I keep thinking about is what is the right decision? What if I choose one and am miserable? What if I move away and my girlfriend breaks up with me, leaving me in a new city, away from my family? What if I get stuck at a dead end position at my current agency?
 

 Does anyone have any advice or thoughts? I just feel like I should be happy because I have options! But I'm just terrified instead."
I've only smoked a year and im afraid I have some sort mouth cancer. a sore on the inside of my mouth and a hard lump under my teeth. I haven't had any other symptoms. idk what to do.
"This was a trait I used to have and a trait I've noticed a girl I'm dating has. There used to be a point in time where I would laugh or smile at everything when begining to talk or responding to someone. Someone would ask me a question, I would laugh or smile at it, and then continue to answer the question. It got to the point a family member gave me the nickname smiley and people would regularly point out the habit or me. So as a result, I've slowly worked on it to make I got rid of this habit. As a result, I no longer laugh at everything.
 

 I've recently met this girl on Hinge who I've been hanging out with for the past few months. She's socially inept, never goes out, doesn't have a lot of friends, and shares many traits I have with social anxiety. But I don't think she has social anxiety herself. She's just not a social person and doesn't engage in social activities as her hobbies are just browsing Reddit and YouTube. I should note the difference between us. I have social anxiety but I'm social enough to the point I know how to properly act when I'm in most social situations. This girl on the other lacks many basic social skills to the point when we first matched on Hinge and even before we met in person, during our chat she directly asked what my salary was since I live by myself. She asked again during our date. She asked this question seemingly completely unaware that this is not a proper question to ask someone even before you meet them.
 

 As I've been hanging out with her, I've noticed she herself laughs at everything like I used to. I ask her any basic question, she starts of with a laugh. I point something out to her, she laughs. I tell something, literally anything, and she start off with a laugh. I haven't point this out to her but I'm actually curious why she does that. Anytime I try to talk to her about anything, she'll start off with a laugh. Even after getting in bed with her, after we finished I told her she has to communicate with me more and she responds with a laugh before properly responding.
 

 Is laughing or smiling a lot a common trait shared by unsocial or people with social anxiety? Or is this just a habit specifically from this girl?"
I use self-deprecation and vulgar language to cope with stress. It's a really bad habit I need to stop. It feels good cause I'm expressing how I feel. But this can't be good for my self-esteem. I am really gonna try and break this habit ASAP tho
Just curious what has worked for everyone. Currently on luvox and therapy but still struggling badly. I'm assuming meds were the big help for most
I am 26 and i just got a job at the hospital serving food to patients and its 3 days a week 12 hour shifts. To be fair i had already done my first 2 days of training on the computer but today is when im supposed to be training on the job. And i feel so bad right now. I have no ways of getting home right now because i have no drivers license and now im just waiting for the public library to open so i can just wait there. I feel so bad for my family and the people that hired me. I will encourage myself to go back tomorrow do my job training spend my days off finishing my remote job interview/assessment for Verizon and hopefully i can get a job from there. I think it'll be better for me to work from home than work with patients for 12 hours a day. Idk what i was thinking walking away from work ive never done before and i hate that i did this but i dont want to go back now because i walked 13 minutes to the library. I'll be there until it's closed just to reevaluate things and if my family finds out that i didnt do my training they'll be pissed. They were so happy i got a job at the hospital but i feel bad for bugging them to take me to work all the time. Hopefully i'll be getting my license this year and also the job at Verizon it has good benefits and such and education assistance because im planning to go back to school. I had also started talking to a psychiatrist and supposed to be in talks of taking meds next week.
"My boyfriend (28) and I (F25) have been officially dating for a little over five months and things have been going fairly well. I have an anxious attachment style and general anxiety. He sometimes travels for work and I feel less connected and like something is wrong even though he has done nothing that would make me think something is wrong. 
 

 

 When we first started dating, I asked how often he travels for work and he said once a month which I thought was fine. However, since the start of this year, he’s been gone a week in January, two and a half weeks in March (for vacation), he’s currently gone for about five days, has a trip planned starting April 18 and then will have another one possibly end of April/ early May. When he travels for work, he has limited free time and cannot bring his personal phone with him during the day so we don’t talk much. He also works weird hours when traveling so sometimes we can’t talk at all. He has no say on when he travels, it’s based on the company needs. 
 

 I need a lot of reassurance in a relationship and we have talked about this multiple times. When he is on trips, I don’t get the reassurance I need and feel generally disconnected. He asked what he can do to make it better when he goes away but I don’t have an answer. The logical part of my brain also says there’s nothing he can do because the nature of his job doesn’t allow him to be on his personal phone while he is working. When he was on vacation, he was in a remote area with no service and I asked him to write me letters before he left so I could open them periodically while he was gone. This kind of worked but I still got stressed and started to emotionally shut down. Can anyone suggest things that can help make the distance and silences less stressful? 
 

 TLDR: I have an anxious attachment style and get stressed and emotionally shut down when my BF goes away for work and has minimal contact. What can we do to make it less stressful for me?"
"So I'm not sure what mine is. Every day I get worried about illness or cancer affecting me (25F), but I'm getting better at pushing it aside. I don't panic, but it's like an intrusive thought that makes life difficult. I relate too much to movies and shows, getting distressed by deaths or illnesses on TV, which I never used to have and I hate it. I miss watching TV and enjoying it, now I avoided it, can't read for the same reason. 
 I haven't been able to work for nearly 2 months now because of this as I'm a creative writer and my brain can't do it now. I'm contemplating asking my dr to switch from Luvox (3 weeks on it) to zoloft or lexapro as I hear it's good for anxiety and I want my life back.
 Whenever I see overweight people too, I wonder if they're concerned for their health, or if I see the elderly, I wonder how long they've got and if they're scared of passing. These thoughts are agonising, I just want them to stop."
There has been some stress at home and it has triggered my anxiety and I have resorted to eating away my feelings. I used to love going for workout but now since 2-3 days I haven’t stepped foot in gym. I don’t even know where to begin. How to not feel overwhelmed.
"I (25F) switched to Effexor nearly 4 months ago and my mental health has been spiraling. I was on 40mg Prozac, and now am on 113mg Effexor. It was a super tough switch. Initially my anxiety would go in waves of feeling really good to feeling awful for weeks straight. I also got engaged to my partner a month ago and since then my anxiety has been through the roof. I don’t feel like myself at all. I made an appointment to get my meds adjusted and it will take 3 months to see a psychiatrist to get that done. I filled out the anxiety questionnaire and I have almost the highest possible ranking. I’m constantly questioning everything. I keep wondering who I am as a person, I question every decision I make, one thing someone says can set me off into panic mode, I question my feelings for my partner which makes me feel even more guilty because he has been my biggest support through all this and I know that I love him so much. My family doctor also just left her practice (perfect timing) and now I have no idea what to do. I almost wish I never switched. Has anyone ever experienced something like this on Effexor? And am I alone in being this anxious after getting engaged? It’s really freaking me out. My wedding is in June and I do not know if it would be a good idea to try and switch meds now or if I should try and push through until the wedding is done, because I know how crazy I can get when switching. Hellllp how do I deal with this??"
"Had a convo on another post about using profanity and self-deprecation for coping with stress. Thought it was kinda funny might throw this out there... does anyone else do this? 
 

 I'm getting better at catching myself as of late. Wb yall?"
"As I'm not suicidal and we are short on psychiatrist/psychologists I currently don't qualify for help and I am therefore working with my Gp to conquer my struggles.
 

 I have been using the ABCD sheet and Adult, Parent, Child model to work through some of my thoughts but we're wondering if anyone had other similar tasks/forms to suggest?
 

 Sorry if my explanation is bad, hopefully you get what I mean."
"I am having a nightmare experience with Effexor. I have the worst anxiety of my life! I went to a walk in clinic because my family doctor left her practice, and I basically begged the Dr to help me get off Effexor. He said it would be easier to do if I go two days without Effexor and then start 10mg Prozac instead of taking nothing at all after. He told me it is going to be really rough for me and now I’m scared and kinda freaking out. Has anyone had experience quitting Effexor and going into Prozac? Is it really bad?"
"I'm going to be 27 in a few months, and I can literally hear the clock ticking right now as I type this. I have no boyfriend/husband right now, no kids, barely have a career going, financial issues, have a fear of driving on highways, barely hang out with friends, feel like I have to look my best, trying to recover from binge eating disorder, etc. I feel incredibly behind in life and like I've failed already in life. It's all too much.
 

 I'm just going through such a rough time right now. I still live with my mom. I'm just starting a new job as a patient service representative at a cardiovascular practice, and training right now. First of all, the girl training me just seems like she doesn't like me for some reason. She's completely different with everyone else but me. Why do I shatter when I feel like someone doesn't like me? I just tell myself ""it's probably just her personality to be like this around new people until she gets comfortable with them"" or ""maybe she just resents me from the beginning because she doesn't want to be training anyone."" I just feel like I can't take it personally because I'm nice and friendly and you can take me or leave me. But why does it still hurt? She's only just training me anyway and I'll be working in a different location. But I still care. Why? I'm so used to this, btw, feeling shunned by girls. (I'm a girl.)
 

 I look around me and it just feels like I don't belong in society. I feel like everyone else around my age has done this, done that, and I'm so behind. I've had only one relationship/situationship with one guy in my life. And the one time we actually had sex, we barely did, because it hurt me too much. And btw, that's been over for six months now. He got fed up with all my texts about my anxiety. I treated him like my therapist and I paid the highest price for it. He met another woman who's much older and lives in another state! So there was that rejection too, even though he still cares about me and wants us to be friends. I'm proud of myself for telling him I won't settle for friendship though. I hope he realizes he made a big mistake. I know I have so much to offer.
 

 But part of life is rejection and I have an incredibly difficult time handling it and accepting it. I also feel like I haven't accomplished enough. Also, in addition to my generalized anxiety disorder and depression, I feel like I have ADHD, and want to be diagnosed with that so I have some closure on why I'm the way I am. Why I'm so forgetful, have trouble focusing, easily distracted, people say I don't listen, I'm lazy, I cry easily, act impulsively sometimes, and just generally have trouble with things.
 

 Sometimes, I have so much trouble and feel so much pain, I feel like I should just end it all."
"The symptom I don’t like the most is the palpitations skipped sensations and sensitive fast heart rate since March 2020 when all my stress started. 
 

 Any suggestions please on why I could be having these feelings randomly? Any type of deficiency? Btw I don’t have dsyautonomia. I am NOT tired,dizzy, lightheaded, fainting,short of breath, no headaches, no vision problems... 
 

 I have gone to many Drs. since then and had a lot of tests done. Autoimmune, ANA, CBC, A1C, blood sugar,cholesterol, kidney, liver, full thyroid, B12, B6, D, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ESR, C reactive, etc blood tests. I had 3 heart monitors now each year for a week each, ECGs, echocardiogram, chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, full spine X-rays and MRI, thyroid ultrasound. I have other symptoms too like back pains, muscle pains in ribs and back, tight upper back, and feet prickle in the heat, my heart rate jumps up when I move around or change or get up from sitting.
 

 I just know my Vitamin D level is low at 14 and my B12 is around 400. I take magnesium glycinate 240 mg."
"Because of bad communication problems, my boyfriend [26M] attempted to dump me [25F] for the second time during our relationship and revoke his decision almost immediately after. I am chronically ill and in chronic pain which has caused me to become depressed and it really put a stress on the relationship, thankfully I am in therapy now. When he did it, I didn’t really understand why, as he said it would make him feel worse and he didn’t feel like it was a good decision. So he told me he would do whatever he could do to promise or prove to me that he would be here for me and he wouldn’t go. 
 

 But now, I can’t help but be scared. I know he’s been trying to rekindle things, but the security I’ve had within him is so rocky now and I’m not sure how to get it back. Has anyone worked through a rough patch like this and has some advice maybe for the both of us things we could do to instill that security back? He seems to want to make a life with me and deeply regrets this decision and would do anything to change it, and I want to cooperate to but don’t know what to suggest to uplift the stability again."
"I notice that my anxiety gets really bad about 6 hours into my day, especially if I don't have a cigerratte until then. Once I have one I feel short relief but then it gets worse, and it becomes a vicious cycle throughout the evening. I'm wondering if anyone noticed anxiety fluctuations around smoking cigarettes that might be helpful. Better yet, has anyone noticed a big decrease in general anxiety from quitting smoking altogether? I started smoking socially when I would drink heavily and I've unfortunately kept the nasty habit even after getting sober. I know I need to quit, I'm 27 and it's early enough in my life that I know I don't want to keep killing my lungs just for temporary relief and the excuse of ""at least I'm not drinking still""."

"-LONG POST-
 

 I’ve always struggled when it came to socialising with people and making friends. It’s been going on since I was as young as 4 or 5 years old.
 

 I always thought that I was just a little introverted and shy but I realised I had social anxiety when I was in my mid teens. It always took me so long to befriend someone. And when someone actually showed some interest in becoming my friend, it literally would surprise me because I didn’t think anyone would care enough to be my friend. 
 

 I haven’t had a best friend since I was 11 years old. I’ve had a few friends when I was in high school. But they were literally the most toxic people in my life. Like if I was in class with one of my ‘friends’, they would start a conversation with me about themselves, but as soon as I start talking about my own problem, they would just go on their phone and then get up and walk away. I never used to confront my ‘friends’ about the way they would treat me. I guess I was just used to it. And I just wanted to keep them in my life so that I wouldn’t be completely alone at school.
 

 I started to suffer from panic attacks in my teens. When I was on the verge of having an attack in school, I would just go hide in the girls toilets because I didn’t want anyone to find out. I hated any kind of attention.
 

 I come from a family that doesn’t take mental health seriously, therefore, neither did I. 
 

 When I graduated from high school, I cut all ties with my so called friends. I wanted a fresh start at university. I was honestly looking forward to making new (and hopefully better) friends. However, my anxiety got the best of me, my mental health was so bad that I had to drop out of university.
 

 Since then I have had a few jobs. I have always been good at the jobs i have done. But I’ve struggled so much when it comes to socialising with people around me.
 

 Now, at 26, I’ve just started my new job as a medical receptionist. I am really struggling to converse with my new colleagues.
 They are honestly so kind and friendly. And they try to have conversations with me. But I just feel like I don’t know how to talk to people. Like I try to communicate with them but it feels like, every time I try to respond to them or try to initiate a conversation, my voice just doesn’t come out. And I have no idea what to say.
 

 I really want to have a good relationship with my colleagues and make friends at work. But it just feels like a huge impossible challenge.
 

 Every Sunday night I cry myself to sleep because I know I will have to deal with people at work starting from Monday morning.
 

 I’m not in touch with any of my friends, so I guess you could say that I have no friends. All I’ve ever wanted my entire life is just atleast one person who would care enough to stay in my life and be a friend.
 

 But at 26 it feels impossible for that to happen.
 

 Sorry for the long post. I just wanted to get this out"

I was working out last night and i cut my ankle on a screw that was poking out of one of the machines at the gym. I’m worried of tetanus since i’m not sure when i last got my shot..i’m 26..it cut into my skin a tiny bit. Will i be okay? What do i do?
"I (26M) have been struggling with anxiety. I think that I've always been a bit like that but sometimes it is very bad because I try to forecast everything. I feel so bad because I fell like I'm not a normal person.
 

 This happens especially with relationships/dating. I try to forecast everything and I end up screwing everything up instead of letting things happen naturally. I know that I should live day by day and enjoy the present instead of thinking what i will do tomorrow based on something I forecasted about the future.
 

 The bad part is that i actually know how I should be behaving and how should I manage my emotions but in practice I just f\*\*\* up everytime and I'm just tired of making the same mistakes everytime.
 

 For example somedays I'm fine if other person takes 6h to answer a text, but in other days if the person takes &gt;1h to respond, I start to panic and telling myself it's all over, especially if we had argued in the previous days. Yes I know I shouldn't be caring about that since in my age people work and even myself sometimes take &gt;8h to respond. But my mind is so tricky sometimes :/
 

 Any advice?"
"I keep dating guys who have a heap of emotional trauma and as a result struggle to identify their own emotional needs. I've been in relationships with men that have been suicidal because they've neglected their emotional needs without realising. I've dated guys that wouldn't let me have male friends because they were convinced every single one of them liked me and didn't realise that he was having a trauma response. And now I'm dating another guy who has ignored his own emotional needs to the point where he doesn't trust me anymore.
 

 Me (25F) and my boyfriend (21M) have been dating for 9 months. The start of our relationship was really stable but recently I've been dealing with a chronic fatigue flair up that makes me really exhausted and sick a lot. This has gotten worse in the last month and around this time I noticed my boyfriend started acting kind of distant. He's been less affectionate and has started making plans on our usual date night. I'd asked him about it and he said everything was okay so I thought maybe he was just trying to focus on self care a bit. Today we were talking and it turns out that he's not really sure he trusts me anymore and cannot tell me why. He wants to continue with the relationship but he has no idea why he doesn't trust and has no idea what I can do to make him feel safer in the relationship. I don't know what to do with this. I feel so stuck and hurt that he's kept this to himself for so long. I wish I knew what I could do to make him feel better but it's hard when he has no idea. It's not the first time he's felt off in our relationship but can't figure out why or what to do. We've identified in the past that he struggles to ask for his emotional needs to be met because he doesn't even know what they are.
 

 This situation is honestly really stressing me out because of the other relationships I've had. I honestly just want to know...is there any way at all things can work if he doesn't know what his needs are?"
It would mean that something was bothering them right? I know when something is on my mind or eating me up I tend to be short with people or at least annoyed. The person I’m talking is “shy” or introverted so it makes since why they would apologize for having a bad interaction ( as said by someone with social anxiety) I’m just curious to what was the underlying cause.
"Here's my story so far. I'm 25 (turning 26 a week from me posting this) and I just got my first car a month and a half ago. I didn't get my permit until I was 19 and didn't become a licensed driver until shortly before my 25th birthday, the reasons being a lack of motivation, laziness, and an overall fear of driving. But so far, things have gone fine. I'm able to drive myself to work and back, go to the gym more often, and do errands. But as of now, I've stayed off the freeways. I know I'll have to eventually (I'm hoping to go on vacation this summer) but it just fills me with so much anxiety and fear. Cars barreling at 70 mph or more with no stop signs. I don't know if I can do it. What do you all think?"
Social anxiety began in middle school and ever since then this shit has stuck with me. I’m 26 now and I feel I’d be more successful in life without this disorder. I feel like I have to try harder and force myself to have conversations in school and at work. It’s exhausting.
"My boyfriend (26M) and I (25F) have been together for nearly two years. His entire life, he has dealt with severe anxiety and some depression. He experiences panic attacks, freezes up in times of challenge, and has consistent negative thoughts about himself. He also is consistently questioning himself and those around him. I could go into intense detail about his episodes or recurring thoughts/issues he deals with, but I could sum it up by simply saying his feelings often debilitate him. It is something that he deals with every day. In challenging times, he takes it out on me or pushes me away. He’s the sweetest person and I know it’s temporary, but still difficult. 
 

 I love him more than ANYTHING, and I think I have quite a lot of patience in difficult times. He is very hesitant to get help via therapy, but is slightly more open to medication. 
 

 At this point, I feel as if there is nothing I can do, and I’m often stressed and anxious about his potential response to unexpected stressful situations, getting basic tasks done, or negative thoughts about himself. I feel like I do everything I can to take his stress away, even doing things for him many of the time. The most recent episode was when he spilled a full cup of soda on the floor and it splashed everywhere and on many belongings- he immediately freaked out, froze, and started to panic and scramble. I ended up cleaning it all up while he calmed himself down in the bedroom. 
 

 I feel powerless and helpless, and it’s impacting our relationship. I also deal with bipolar disorder, and thus have my own mental health issues. 
 

 What can he do, outside of therapy or medication, to combat his anxiety? What are some tactics or things I can do to support him? I’m unsure if or when he will decide to get professional help, but I want to give him the resources he needs to help himself. It’s hard to watch someone you love suffer so much, and I’m not sure there’s anything I can do to help at this point. Any advice is appreciated. 
 

 Please don’t encourage me to break up with him, I will not do that."

"From March 2020 up until a few weeks ago, we all worked from home full-time due to coronavirus.
 

 Starting a few weeks ago, we began going back into the office 2 days a week and it's been really difficult for me in terms of anxiety.
 

 I got comfortable in my home, in my routine and with my own setup. I almost forgot about cramped commuter buses/trains, stuffy office buildings that are always too warm or getting squashed into a tiny lift/elevator with ten other people. These are all major triggers for my anxiety and I've been having a really hard time recently.
 

 I keep having panic attacks, getting too warm (anyone else get a sudden wave of heat? It almost feels like a hot flash), suddenly feeling faint or just being madly uncomfortable in my body.
 

 I'm speaking to my therapist and I'm working through it but I guess I just wanted to have a bit of a rant here.
 

 I made so much progress with my anxiety before Covid - to the point where panic attacks were a distant nightmare. Now I feel like I'm back at square one and it's infuriating. I'm learning to be OK all over again and it's really hard.
 

 It's bleeding into other aspects of my life too; I had a panic attack while out for coffee with a friend last week and I suddenly felt shaky and panicky at the wheel of my car just yesterday. These things haven't happened in so long that it just feels awful to be at this stage again.
 

 Thank you for listening."

Has anyone had success with relationships? I’m a 26F and have only dated 1 person and I feel like it’s so hard to become comfortable around someone when dating.
"Ok so first relationship, I (28F) and my BF (28M) have in terms of intimacy reached making out, that’s the farthest. (No sex or even touch private areas) 
 

 This weekend my parents were going to the mountains for Easter and I didn’t feel like going. I told my bf about it and he offered for me to stay in the guest room… now I REALLY want to keep moving forward in the relationship… so the texts (yes we text a lot as we don’t see each other often and he’s also very shy)
 

 OP:
 Ok I appreciate it a lot 🙂 … maybe one of the nights I’m there we could sleep together (not the act just sleep) only if your comfortable of course if not we can completely say I was joking.
 

 BF:
 I’d be willing though I’m unsure how comfortable that will be. We can give it a try and see how we feel.
 

 OP:
 Absolutely and if at any point either of us feel uncomfortable or anything we can stay in separate rooms. 
 

 

 

 Now this is clearly a good reasonable response… so why do I feel so embarrassed and feel like I messed up somehow! This really pushed my courage and while I did succeed I still feel… like failure or something I’m not sure….
 

 Any advice or kind support words?"
"I’m a teacher, and last year I had a student eat lunch with me that was struggling emotionally. She said something to me that still has stuck to me to this day.
 

 “My depression has me fixated on my past and my anxiety has me focused on the future. I want to live in the present.”
 

 While I know this can’t help all of us, I’ve really resonated with these words and it’s helped my anxiety more than I’ve thought. Everyone has their triggers and different ways to cope, but… I thought I would throw this wisdom out there from a middle schooler!"
"Hello everyone. This is my first post here. If the general thread of this post seems to make absolutely no sense, I'm sorry in advance. There are so many things I going through my head, but I have no idea what order to put them down in. I'm just going to try my best, and I'd be grateful for any potential tips. I'm basically just going to write out everything that I have racing through my head now to put it down in words, so as to maybe make some sense of it for myself.
 

 I'm originally from the U.S., but have spent a large chunk of my life in Europe. I'm getting close to graduating with my Master's in translation from a school in Paris, and especially since applying for jobs, I've been overcome with acute anxiety. I feel this sense of impending doom about being an adult and having an adult job, that I need to support myself, and especially that I need to make a decision on what to do next. Everything seems so serious and fatal. Add an ever-growing feeling of homesickness into the mix, especially due to the fact that my mom's been visiting me for the past week and that she's leaving tomorrow, and you get how I feel right now.
 

 Ever since I was very little, I've loved languages- I started learning my first ones on my own as a 10-year-old, and even invented my own language. I had dreamt of travel and living abroad from a young age, and finally, after a few shorter stints abroad, I made the move to Germany at the age of just 17. So for the past ten years, I've been essentially on my own in Germany.  
 

 When I first moved over here, I didn't think too much about home. Sure, I missed my family, but it didn't get in the way of me living abroad. Things started to change when I was 20. I had a major mental breakdown due to OCD in early 2015, which lead to me flying home for a 6-week period to be with family and see a therapist a few times a week. When I returned to Europe the following semester, I had a major breakdown upon arrival. I felt completely unprepared for being away from home. This feeling subsided after a few days, but it set a precedent for almost every time I've returned to Europe from visits in the U.S. since then- I almost always have a breakdown, and they seem to have gotten more and more intense. Once I'm back over here for a few days, it's fine, but it makes travel back and forth very difficult.
 

 Enter the pandemic- I was already living in Paris in 2020 when the world shut down. I didn't stick around for long after the first lockdown started, and instead I flew to be with my family in the U.S. What I thought would be a month or two ended up being 18, with just a two week period in between to move things out of my apartment. I hate to admit it to myself, but I really enjoyed being home. It was a much quieter and simpler life, but it was like I got back that final year of high school at home that I had lost when I moved to Germany at 17. Which did not make things easy when it came time to move back. I felt crushing anxiety to the point where I could barely talk the day I was meant to leave. I had to continue to repeat mantras to myself like: ""Just one more year of school and then you can move home"" just to get myself to pack the basics and head to the airport.
 

 From reading all of this, you might think- wow, it doesn't sound like you like living abroad at all, so just move back! But this actually couldn't be any farther from the truth. I LOVE living abroad. I love being in close proximity to so many different languages and cultures, being able to interact with all different kinds of people every day, and just experiencing different ways of life. Once I get over here, I'm perfectly happy. Except I'm also perfect happy in my small hometown in the U.S. close to my family. It's just that in the U.S., my world seems so much smaller.  
 

 I essentially feel completely torn between to different lives- one on my own in Europe, and one in the U.S close to home and family. I feel this impending pressure to make a decision, as my studies are drawing to a close. Do I set up my life over here in Europe or do I give up everything I've built here and head home? Just thinking about trying to make this decision makes me feel sick. But I think it's also the fear of being a fully fledged adult. I know that legally I've been an adult for almost a decade, but I almost feel like there's this anxious little child in me who's crying out to be with his family, safe at home. It sounds super pathetic but I don't know how else to explain it. Am I emotionally stunted maybe?
 

 When I was little, I loved to create my own worlds. One such world was a country that encompassed my family home and yard as well as a few neighboring properties. My made-up language was its official language. After owning that house for 22 years, my parents are selling it- they made the decision while I was away, and I don't even know I'll be able to say goodbye to my childhood home at this point, because it might be sold by the next time I'm home. I think this is weighing on me subconsciously more than I initially expected it would. I feel this crushing need to mourn my childhood which seems like it can never be returned. I just feel so crappy, but I don't know what to do except cry."
"M27 - I have been having horrible sustained physical symptoms for 3 consecutive months. I feel like I can manage what's in my head, but I just can't get my gut right. I would dry heave most mornings up until 3 weeks ago. I feel so full and nauseous in the morning that I can't even hold down a glass of water or other beverage for the first hour. Food is a struggle all day. I'm eeking out 2000 or so calories and lost weight. I have cramps in my gut, eating physically hurts at times. It's absolutely unbearable. 
 

 I can only take in so much liquid a day too, so it's been harder to hit the gym. My gut is in pain and cramping and even the workout is miserable. 
 

 I've seen a good GI too and the stuff he gave helped a bit, but nothing structurally wrong with my gut. 
 

 I feel I'm doing everything short of meds (I really want to avoid at all costs): 
 

 -Meditation
 -Ashwaghanda/L-theanine/Magnesium/etc
 -Therapy and I like the therapist 
 -Aromatherapy
 -Gym 2-3x per week (although physical pain limits it)
 -Socializing with people at parks and public places.
 -Trying to change catastrophic thoughts and journaling. 
 

 Some background- I had social anxiety with similar sustained symptoms. I could barely eat or drink anything before, during and after social situations with new groups of classmates/friends/co-workers. Over time, up until about 4 or so years ago, I finally realized that my underlying thoughts/subconscious were ridiculous and that people tended to really like me. After that, I became quite confident. Life was great. 
 

 I also was inactive in dating up until about a year ago. I hit the apps hard (except Tinder, not interested in hookups) and went on about 20 or so dates. I was confident and had little to no anxiety, even when getting rejected I could just move on... Until about 3 months ago. It started from a date that ""broke the camel's back."" We seemed to hit it off and all the good signs were there and... poof. Ghosted. This wasn't the first time something like this happened, but I was suddenly overwhelmed by a freight train of anxiety. 
 

 I have managed to go on some dates since, but I'm so anxious in my gut that I can barely hold down a glass of water, let alone a drink. Even one glass of wine creates a horrible hangover now. I have to shut down the recurring and sustained gut issues so I can enjoy life again. It's an every day issue even when I don't think I'm anxious. 
 

 I have some things going for me, so I've been surprised by the lack of dates turning into relationships: 
 

 -I'm 6'0 so relatively tall
 -I was around 180 lbs and lean with abs before the weight loss. Im around 160 now, so kinda skinny but not a horrible physique 
 -I make a good salary, around $140K
 -I'm definitely not ugly, attractive female friends (married or serious BF) randomly compliment my looks at times
 -I'm intelligent and can be funny. 
 

 I know there are some cons:
 -Weak social circle
 -Lack of relationship experience 
 

 I don't want a dating lecture. I just want to be healthy. I'm trying to change my mindset to an ""I don't care attitude,"" but nothing seems to be working. 
 

 Has anyone had a similar issue with sustained gut issues and how did you fix it?"
"I would like to preface this by saying I am not an anti masker or an anti vaxxer. Everyone can make their own decisions and things. I just would like to ask questions and see if anyone might feel the same as me. 
 

 Did anyone kind of randomly develop anxiety after being vaccinated? 
 

 Is there a possibility of the vaccine messing with the vagus nerve or something else?"

"Hello dears,
 I dunno about my mental health...have you ever had thoughs about:
 -life doesn't seem real...it's seems a sort of virtual stuff
 -what's the meaning of life?
 -do you feel anxiety when you have to do something (for example going to work, studying, talking with people)
 -am i really real? Sometimes i'm doing something but i don't feel i'm 100% present"
"This happens because I was bullied in high school and also because I witnessed some teens doing bad stuff like drugs , beating someone up for no reason. It doesn't matter if I'm alone or with a group of people, the feeling is the same. Tried doing some breathing exercises, putting my hands in the pockets of my jacket and clench my fists (for some reason this makes the feeling decrease in intensity). I'm 25 and i struggle with this since the age of 14. Ot makes it hard to socialize with someone outside of work and it makes me feel like I'm still a kid"
"I feel as though if I don't get really angry at something or anxious about a certain thing. That anxiety is still there, but it comes out as panic which is way worse. I don't know if I'm just making this up or not."
"27F first time poster just putting some things that are heavy on my mind. For as long as I can remember I have had a weird thing about eating at gatherings, other groups of people, etc. No clue why. My mom’s family is pretty close so I’ve grown up going to plenty oh holiday dinners and cookouts and for the most part I’m pretty comfortable eating there. However, I have never gotten comfortable eating anywhere else. If we go to something for my fiancé’s family (we’ve been together a while now and I’ve spent plenty of time around his family) he already plans to stop on the way home and get me something because he knows I’ll be hungry when we leave. He also tries to get me to eat stuff off his plate so I can at least look like I’m eating. My mom tends to bring me a small plate of something I can pick at. But I just can’t bring myself to walk up there and fix myself a plate no matter how hungry I am. I felt so bad the other night after not eating at my fiancé’s work dinner especially after he told me they were upset I didn’t eat anything. I felt so awkward today at my own job’s carry not eating and of course I messed up the thing I was going to bring so I didn’t even have that. I typically would have went home for lunch but it just felt wrong to do that on a day they were all bringing food and planning to eat together. I love to cook so I always bring something I just never eat anything. I always feel so bad and awkward for it. I’m not a real picky eater. I love trying different kinds of food. I do think I have some social anxiety as I’m painfully shy and always worry about offending someone in some way."
"I (25F) grew up being pretty much the shy and quiet kid. Whenever I am in a new social environment it feels like it always takes me a really long time to adapt and make a few friends while everyone just seems to thrive so easily. 
 

 Last year, I had to move churches which means new social environment and a need to make new friends. 
 

 However, due to the pandemic and lockdowns I have only started going this February. Every single weekend since, I have been so anxious and worried whenever I do go, worried about what to say, worried if I won't be able to carry on conversations, worried that I won't be able to develop any friendships and I'll just end up being the awkward person no one really wants to be around. Even while people do talk to me I worry that I am just boring them, and even if the conversation doesn't turn out awkward I worry that I am just one step away from them deciding that I am not worth their time.
 

 When I don't end up going, my mind is peaceful for a moment until I start suffering from FOMO. So I am just perpetually feeling anxious. And now this weekend they're running a lot of social events and even though I want to go I can't stop having all these thoughts. It doesn't help tha there's new people who started going after I started going to this church and already it feels like they have made friends while I am still stuck.
 

 I decided that maybe it is time for me to seek therapy, but I'm scared that I'll never get rid of these thoughts/feelings and scared that it's too late for me to be different. Does anyone have any advice on how to get out of this state? Is it actually too late for me??"
"For some reason 7 years ago, in my senior year of college, I suddenly started experiencing a lot of separation anxiety and depression around being away from my parents even though I never had an issue with that before. I ended up having to take a leave of absence from school for a year because I couldn't function from the depression, and I ended up inpatient for around a week to try and find a medication that would work for me. When I did visit home after returning to school I would get tearful for the last day or two of the visit and saying goodbye would have me crying for days back in my dorm. I live in a different state that's about a 4-hour drive.
 

 I'm 28 now and I'm so tired of feeling like this. I have no idea what triggered it this time and I'm terrified it means it's going to start happening randomly instead of only from the separation anxiety. I just woke up Wednesday morning like this and called out of work yesterday. It's now 7:21AM where I live and I've been up since 4:30AM and have been crying for over an hour, even after taking the as-needed Clonazepam. I've had no appetite and have been struggling to distract myself because it feels like nothing interests me.
 

 I don't want to keep living like this and I'm scared that I'm going to spend the rest of my life dealing with this. I've been working with the same therapist and psychiatrist for around three years and I like them and feel like they try to make themselves available when I'm struggling, but what's the point of going to therapy and being on daily medication for 7 years if this is just going to keep happening? I think the daily medication did (does?) help and I've been on it for 6 years. Things have improved a lot, I'm aware of that, and leaving my parents' house after visiting has been going better every year.
 

 At least before I mostly understood what triggered this days-long depression and anxiety bouts, but now I have no idea why this is happening and I'm really frustrated and depressed. I just want to be normal and happy like I was before."
"I (28F) have had this weird aching pain in my left underbelly, (not superficial), for 2 months now. Sometimes it worsens and radiates to upper left leg. Especially when I ate or when I'm walking, like when the pressure on the spot worsens. Luckily my GP let me do echo's of my reproductional organs and my lower belly organs. I also did a blood, urine and feces test. Nothing has shown up yet.
 

  I'm so afraid that I have cancer or a blood clot or something else dangerous. I don't think the GP can do anymore tests, because sometime pain is just inexplicable. I know how anxiety belly ache feels, for me it feels like cramping through my whole intestines, and it worsens when I'm anxious. This is not like that. 
 

 Do you have stories of similar pain or health anxieties? I'd love to hear. 😢"
"I have 0.5mg of Clonazepam to use as needed (and I take Effexor daily). When I go through these crisis ""episodes"" they can last a few days of constant crying, lack of appetite, depression, racing heart, etc. When I take the Clonazepam it will sometimes make me drowsy enough to knock me out for an hour or two but once I'm up I'm back to feeling the way I was before.
 

 My psychiatrist told me that I need to also utilize coping skills (which I try to do) but I'm trying to use the Clonazepam to calm me down enough to utilize them appropriately. If I don't notice a particularly large difference when I take the Clonazepam does that mean it's not working and I need to consider a different option? Or am I expecting too much from as needed drugs?
 

 I'm just really desperate to get out of these episodes when they happen and I'm on day four of this one; they cause more anxiety as they happen because I can't stop thinking about this happening for the rest of my life and it makes it really hard to function. I'm working with my therapist but obviously, she can't meet with me every day. When I'm in these episodes I become very attached to my mom and want to be with her and my dad, but I'm an adult and I live in a different state. I try to avoid calling them because that tends to make me feel even worse."
"I'm overweight (I eat as a coping mechanism)
 I'm unemployed (I'm drowning in school debt)
 I'm boring (I lack culture and common sense)
 I don't know how to accept love 
 I know that's not that bad but you know it's not a great situation either. 
 

 

 I feel that my social anxiety comes from a inferiority complex (but instead of lashing out and being a bully I shut down and keep everything in, not being able to connect with others around me), I don't think I can carry a conversation plus I feel like a loser next to my peers. I know that my perception of myself is not true but it's so hard to change it. 
 

 Talking to people helps, even if all I want to do is run from them, I believe that that's the only solution and the more I talk the easier it gets. 
 

 A good advice I got was to write down my thoughts every time I want to express myself it really helps if you feel like you can't talk to anyone about your problems and when you actually talk to someone it's easier to juste recite something polished then improvising in the spot"
"I always hated the lack of success stories posted on this sub. It made me feel like it was hopeless and there no one else was improving so I'm stuck like this as well. So i've decided to write this post, even though its not a total success as of yet.
 

 I'm 28 years old and had severe social anxiety since i was about 15. all he usual stuff like not being able to answer in class, talk to people i didnt know, order food make phone calls etc. I used alcohol to cope and things only got worse. I never held a job down for longer than 10 months, despite having a maths degree from a good uni, and up until about 5 months ago i was genuinely convinced i couldnt function in this world. I didnt think i could work any job at all, was living with my parents and hadnt even kissed a girl in 3 years. I was in such a dark place. I even got a temp data entry job and got on the bus to go in on my first day and just didnt go in. When i came home i broke down Infront of my parents. I really didnt know what to do. 
 

 After that day i kept half hearted applying for jobs that seemed less scary. Nothing that mentioned social skills or customer service or that i thought would be a big open plan office. I got two interviews in the space of a week, both of which on zoom. I managed to get through the first one but didnt get the job. It went okay. Messed up a couple of answers but dont feel i left a bad impression. The next interview i very nearly didnt attend. I remember being about to enter the link and my anxiety trying its best to tell me not to do it. 'There's no way you'll get this', 'you havent even practised these types of questions', 'they will definitely ask you them and youre not prepared'. Anyways, i managed to get through it and it went okay. again i messed up a bit but felt i left a decent impression. They called the next day and i got the job. Fuck, im going to have to do this. 
 

 The job is working for the mental health service in my city. so answering the phones and interacting plenty with my team mates. I thought there was no way i could do it. For the first three weeks i thought about getting of the bus and not going in every day. The whole bus journey was torture. Horrible anxiety, could feel in in my chest and my gut constantly. During this period i want even answering the phones yet, but i had tat constant fear that it was coming down the line and that i wouldnt be able to do it. Well the day arrived where i had to answer the phones, and again i got though it. It wasnt perfect, i was awkward as fuck and made mistakes all the time but i did it. One big thing ive learnt is that its rarely the nightmare we think its going to be. That doesnt mean things are going to go great. Its often somewhere in between. Closer to the nightmare side of thing sure, but its never the absolute worst case for me. Most social challenges are really uncomfortable for me but i can get through them. 
 

 Ive been at this job for 4 months now and its getting easier all the time. I'm still anxious and it still causes me to make mistakes but i can do the job. I feel proud all of the time that im doing it. I still feel anxious before i go to work and sunday nights can be tough. But its often okay once im in work. I dont notice the improvements as they happen, but i remember thinking a couple of weeks ago that my heart doesnt sink as much when i hear the phone ring. I was even training a new member of staff on the phone a couple of weeks back. I messed up her first phone call but we smashed it after that. This is the first job ive had where i dont think about quitting all the time. I havent though about quitting since the first few weeks.
 

 So basically, i thought i was doomed to living with my parent for life. Maybe working off temp jobs or something. Probably single forever with no friends. My life isnt perfect right now, nothing is coming easy to me, but its so much better than the nightmare i was in.
 

 One last point i want to end on is that this job is the most socially challenging job ive ever had. Dont write off a type of work because of a bad experience. The environment and team your working on can make all the difference. I've worked in warehouses and as an accountant where i didnt speak to anyone and it just made me feel so bad about myself. Theres something horrible about being the odd one out. This job im forced to talk to people and after a few weeks it causes me way less anxiety than the jobs where ive just sat there quietly as an outsider. When i end a phone call im psyched up and much more likely to engage in conversation. I dont just sit there miserably anymore. I still havent been dating or anything but im about to move out and i feel so much better about my future. Im sure if i keep taking consistent small actions that i will continue to make progress."
"Last year, I started to feel lonely, especially after beginning therapy (which I’ve now finished). I have a big family and friends, but I still have moments and waves of loneliness. I’m
 27F, single and living alone. 
 

 I’m the youngest of 7 siblings, so I often feel like the outcast or the one whose voice and presence doesn’t matter. Although I’ve worked through this, the effects of childhood show up more now. 
 

 With my friendships, I began realising I have a lot of acquaintances rather than friends. People who I have 1:1 relationships with but they have they core friends. 
 

 I have got core 3 friends but one has best friends who she went uni with and although we are close, she invests more time with others than me, we spend more time on the phone than together in person. 
 

 My other two best friends are in a different space mentally where they are not as social, but this is because they have had a difficult few years so I understand their distance at times.
 

 I recently reconnected with a childhood friend who is more on the same page as me and gradually re-building that relationship. 
 

 

 This past year forming a friendship group where we have shared interests, and spend quality time together has been something I’ve wanted but I’m 27 and often feel people already have their friendships set, so forming strong bonds doesn’t seem likely. 
 

 I moved into my own place 6 months ago and have felt waves of loneliness more often, not many people visit me casually, but I know this could be distance, as I’m not as near to everyone as I used to be, also, I know it’s effort and money to travel to people, and as adults all you want to do on the weekend is hibernate (even I struggle to visit my parents sometimes because I’m exhausted from the week) I just mentally need to click that in my head it’s not personal. 
 

 I created this fantasy in my head that my apartment would be the spot, and my friend could chill here and it will feel like a comfortable place for them. I’ve always grown up in a home that visitors would come to every weekend, and it was just a social home, so now not having that feels strange. Having that girl friendship group where memories are created, holidays, brunches, outings etc is something I feel I’m missing out on. 
 

 I never used to feel self conscious about friendships or making friends, as people used to naturally gravitate to me anyway. But now I’m quite self conscious and potentially paranoid that I’m trying too hard, or people aren’t interested in getting to know me, which I’m sure is all in my head. 
 

 

 Not sure I have a question, more so, how do you manage feelings of loneliness? Can anyone relate?If you live alone and are single how do you manage waves of loneliness?"
The idea of being happy terrifies me. I am always looking for reasons to be a victim and sad. What could be the possible reason for me wanting to be this way? Is it because I have been sad for some reason or the other that I started finding comfort in it? How do I break out of this cycle?

"I'm not sure if this is the right sub to share this experience, but I just really wanted to share this experience somewhere.
 

 My entire life I have been dealing with anxiety and depression, and constantly have negative thoughts in my head. I never get a good night sleep and always wake up with back pain.
 

 Then recently I was talking to someone and they noticed that my voice sounds flat and my nose seems stuffy. So they recommended me to go get my sinus checked.
 

 I first went to an allergy doc but was then sent to a sinus specialist and was diagnosed with deviated septum and minor sinus problem.
 

 Fast forward a few weeks, I got an endoscopic surgery to fix my problem and the positive effects is almost immediate. I don't feel the constant pressure in my head anymore. My sleeping improved dramatically. And all the negative thoughts and feelings started to subside. I still get minor anxiety here and there but the physical effects (elevated heart rate, constant rumination and etc) are almost gone (or at least very manageable now).
 

 I am 28 and can't believe it took me this long to realized this. Breathing is very important to your mental state. I think this is the main reason why meditation has such a positive effects on your mental state, it's literally just breathing.
 

 To anyone dealing with anxiety, I know how tough it is...just breath through it. Good luck to everyone."
"So I firmly believe that I might have separation anxiety, though not diagnosed by a professional. Since I’ve been in a long term relationship, I’ve had a hard time with him drinking or doing “dangerous” things when I’m away from him. When I’m with him it’s not an issue, but when I’m away from him and I know he’s out drinking with his friends or if he’s doing some labor intensive things at work, I get extremely anxious and fixated on it. Recently he stopped drinking for three months, just so my anxiety over getting worried when he’s out with his friends would go down.
 

 Lately he would like to resume drinking again, though slowly, and tonight he’s hanging out with his friend having pizza for dinner. In the back of my mind, even though he didn’t mention anything, all I can picture is him getting drunk or something stupid like that. (It also doesn’t help that I don’t really adore his friends because they act like college frat boys when they’re in their late twenties. My significant other doesn’t like that I associate them to alcohol, but I can’t help it!)
 

 Thoughts? Suggestions? Recommendations?"

"Naturally, ever since 2020 looking out for symptoms became very top of mind. Even though I'm not that obsessed anymore, I'm getting anxious and even panic attacks when I have *one* little cough.  
 

 

 I always feel like the cough won't ever leave me and I will become less and less fit and healthy as of now, or that I have a serious disease that causes it. 
 

 

 The worst thing is that as a small cough happens once or a couple of times a week. So I often end up in the obsessive thinking spiral, usually resulting in a panic attack. I also feel panic when other people cough, but when it's me it's just a nightmare. 
 

 

 I'd really appreciate any tips &lt;3"
"If you see two people borderline argument, does it get you uncomfortable? Even if it’s just banter? I feel as though I get socially repressed to the extreme when people banter and it’s even worse when there is tension. Pretty much gives me ptsd and a nervous breakdown. Not too sure why."
"To all the anxiety sufferers on here, I empathize with you all. Every day that I read this sub, I relate to it. I’m currently a Public Health graduate student and I hope one day I can help people cope with anxiety with better strategies than what we have now.
 

 Sending love and light. ❤️"
"27F Just had covid 2 weeks ago, I went back to work 2 days ago and since then on 2 occasions I’ve seen something that’s « not there ». First time I looked at a pair of my shoes from the corner of my eye and thought it was a cat for 1 second, then I looked directly at them and I saw the real shoes.
 Then today I was walking past a house that I knew was number 56, but I looked and it said 35 for 1 second, then I looked again and it was 56. 
 I’ve had real hallucinations before all within the context of sleep, under periods of intense stress I have hallucinated spiders on the wall when just waking up/falling asleep and I’ve seen shadow people twice when super jet lagged but they were related to sleep problems. 
 Seeing as they started when I went back to work, could it be related to fatigue even though I feel like I’ve slept 8 hours. The brain fog has been bad because I’ve had to concentrate compared to the lying around while on sick leave. It’s not so much that I’m hallucinating new things, but misinterpreting what is there. 
 

 But I’m scared I’m becoming psychotic or something 😬 I do suffer from bad anxiety so maybe others would just brush this sort of thing off, but I’m freaking tf out"
"I'll preface this by mentioning that i've dealt with anxiety since I was a teen (honestly, probably earlier because I was always an anxious kid) and I have PMDD (which i'm currently treating). 
 

 I (F28) purposely hadn't dated in almost 2 years due to how things ended in my last ""situationship,"" for lack of a better term. During that period, I worked on myself and not to brag but I did pretty well. I got my masters degree, found some new hobbies, and realized what I wanted out of life. I felt pretty good and confident about myself, better than I had in years. Better enough to want to start dating again. So back in January, I re-downloaded a dating app and met the guy (M32) i'm currently dating. He's great. He's sweet, considerate, laidback, and introverted (just like me lol). We've been talking since late-January and physically dating since March, so we haven't put labels on anything yet; which is fine because I don't want to rush into anything. We text every day and see each other every week. He's made it obvious that he's into me and always wants to spend time with me when he can.
 

 I shouldn't be doubtful about anything nor do I have reason to, but unfortunately, I am. I'm paranoid about him ghosting me (note: I went through a painful ghosting experience a few years ago, so that's a fear that still nags at me), seeing someone else, and/or losing interest in me. I KNOW it's all in my head and half the scenarios I make up don't make sense/aren't based in anything logical; but it's hard to remember that when those thoughts feel overpowering and pervasive. For example, when I text him and he doesn't text back for a while, I automatically think he's losing interest or doesn't want to talk to me; in reality, he's at work where he has a 10 hour shift. Of course he's busy and will get back to me when he can. He always does. This is the kind of cycle anxiety has me trapped in. I'm worried it's affecting how I interact with him. For insistence, i'm a pretty quiet person by nature (luckily he is too so he understands this about me) but i'm afraid i'm just too quiet and haven't opened up to him as much I would like to. 
 

 I shouldn't feel so drained by this! I want to enjoy dating this guy and enjoy the time we spend together. I try to do my own thing and recognize that he needs to do his but that anxiety is always lingering. How do I navigate this?? 
 

 (I'm so glad this subreddit exist because it makes me feel less crazy lol.)"

"I have severe social anxiety and I also struggle to converse with people. 
 

 I just started my new job this month and everyone’s super nice and friendly. But everytime they try to have a conversation with me, I don’t know how to respond. 
 

 I have always struggled to communicate with people. I’ve always kept to myself since I was a kid. But now I’m in my mid 20s and I really am sick of living like this. But everytime I try to initiate a conversation with someone, my anxiety kicks in. 
 

 I really want to make friends at work but I don’t know what to do. And I really don’t want my new colleagues to think that I’m not interested in talking to them.
 

 I honestly don’t know what to do."

"So, I (M27) have been constantly fighting anxiety throughout the years(15 years or so). I've taken beta blockers, SSRI's in the past. It was low dosage and i've completely stopped it. I used to get panic attacks, but things are a lot under control as i've changed/improved over the years. Almost got rid of my social anxiety too. There is one specific thought pattern, that still haunts me. I dont know the name of it, so here it goes.
 

 The thing is i need a way out, ALWAYS . Its like agoraphobia of life situations. If i am joining a new job, the first thing i am worried about is, if i quit my job, am i going be ok. Things like this haunts me. I dont like to be trapped. 
 

 I gave myself insomnia recently by worrying about not getting enough sleep.Doctor prescribed an anxiety pill, and then i slept. Now i dont take the pill, but i sleep soundly just thinking that if things gets bad, i can always take that pill. The pill has become my ""way out"" in this case.
 

  Even at times, of life itself, i tell myself that if things get too bad l, i can always kill myself. I am not actually suicidal, but this brings me comfort often. Things like these, have been shaping my whole life over the years, i've got a ""way out"" for many of imaginary scenarios, but still something pops every once in a while. Like for example, I am terrified of getting married in the future, as a whole new person will be depending on me, and this will ruin my suicide ""way out"".
 

 This thought pattern has really made me unable to take any risks and i often feel like i miss out on many things due to this. 
 

  Any advice or help is appreciated. I hope someone gets what i am meaning to say 😂"
"So I've been on the recovery path for a few months. I ended my health anxiety in December. Had GAD and insomnia through to the end of March about. I've finally started sleeping pretty decent after a tough experience with insomnia. I've managed or eliminated almost all my symptoms except brain fog. It's still pretty much all day every day but I have noticed slight improvement from say December. I'm making sure I'm hydrated and I'm back to exercising. Some days like today I can't see through the clouds enough to get any meaningful work done at my job. Other days I can put together a few productive hours. 
 

 I'm getting disheartened because I rarely get any relief from it and I feel like an idiot who forgets EVERYTHING. I'm mostly upset because I really thought getting the insomnia fixed up a bit and getting rest would help much more. I'm not looking for cures or anything, I know it just needs more time I guess, but some stories might help me try and stay more positive about this."
"I (27M) work as a Civil Engineer and have to hold meetings with important clients and present complex information in front of large groups of intelligent people. I also have social anxiety and panic attacks. My panic attacks occur when I am having an important conversation with a client or when presenting for large groups. I get anxiety from the fear of getting the panic attacks. 
 

 When I have a panic attack my heart races and feels like it’s in my throat, and I have a loss of words. I can’t find the words to speak and it’s terrifying. Typically the panic only lasts a few seconds. I take 100mg of Zoloft a day, and I usually take Propranolol when I know I might be in a situation that will set me off. The meds definitely help, and so far I haven’t had any incredibly embarrassing moments, but I’m afraid it will happen. As I move forward in my career I will have to present more, and without the support of my superiors. I do not take caffeine and try and run 5 miles twice a week, and I feel this has also helped. 
 

 I just wanted to get it off my chest. I have had anxiety since I was 15, the situations that set me off have changed over time. I hope that as I progress into my adulthood and career I become more comfortable with these situations. I’d really appreciate any suggestions and advice. What meds/practices have helped you?"
"28M by the way*
 

 So last Saturday I'm driving to work. Everything's cool. Normal ride as usual. Listening to music. Suddenly my hands get tingly and numb. And then they lock around the steel. I was about 2 minutes from work so I finished the drive but explained to my supervisor I felt like I was having an anxiety attack, despite not really having anxious feelings. Yesterday morning I'm driving home. Same conditions. Everything's cool. When suddenly my hands tingle again. This time much harder. I immediately pull over but I'm struggling to let go of the steering to push the gear shift into park or hit my hazards. After about twenty minutes of being incredibly hot and struggling to remove restricting clothes I finally got my hands relaxed enough to drive. Then it happened again this morning but I saw the signs and pulled over much quicker. Took off my beanie, my jacket, I'm wearing a long sleeve under a short sleeve and I take them both off and get my short sleeve back on. By now my hands are really struggling to not be locked and I could only get my socks off about halfway before having to resort to like dragging them on the car mat to push them off. There was a time between my first two explanations but that was at home and was treated with a shower and watching a movie. Are these anxiety attacks? I've necer experienced this before and 4 in a week is alarming. Especially because I was feeling pretty level headed, not thinking anything heavy when they occurred. Just routine driving to and from work."
"Long story short, at the end of February my fiancé (26M - together for &gt;3.5 years) tried to break up with me. For the past year and a half, my anxiety has been HORRIBLE and I was treating him as my therapist. He was burnt out and couldn’t do it anymore. He actually tried to break up with me twice that week. I have bad GAD and health anxiety. I would cry for hours everyday about some disease I convinced myself I had. Understandably, it was hard for him. 
 

 Anyways, I got on medication (Lexapro) and started seeing a new therapist (I was on several wait lists for months and finally got one). I have been in therapy many times before. Some therapists more helpful than others. I REALLY like my new therapist. And lexapro has been a life saver! I was so scared to take medication, but it’s what I needed. 
 

 It’s been 2 months and things are SOOOO much better. We have fun everyday, I no longer worry about random diseases, I’ve only cried once in 2 months (massive improvement for me - I use to cry nearly everyday!). 
 

 One thing I’m still struggling with is reassurance seeking. I keep asking him if he’s sure he wants to marry me, if we are ok, if he’s ok, if he’s going to resent me, etc.He says he’s getting frustrated with these questions because they make him sad as it makes him feel like I don’t trust him and he’s told me how they make him feel bad but I keep asking him, which makes him feel like I don’t respect him. 
 

 I need to stop asking these reassurances or at least substantially reduce how often I ask (I usually ask about 5 minutes of questions a day now). But I find that these questions literally just slip out of my mouth. Almost like I have no control over them. 
 

 How do I stop myself from asking? How do I resist the SUPER intense urge to ask?? The urge is insanely intense. Like I can’t control it."
"Every few months, I (f26) get hit with a swell of anxiety about not having plans during my weekend, and knowing I’ll be alone. 
 

 My friends all have plans tonight, My boyfriend is away visiting friends. 
 

 I’m not being excluded from anything, everyone is just busy..and yet, I get hit with this pang of dread and feeling like i’m a loser for not having plans for spending a Saturday alone. 
 

 Even though I know deep down that it’s totally normal to spend some weekends alone, my body gets incredibly anxious, and I get flooded with thoughts that No one likes me, or people are intentionally not inviting me."
"This has to be the most annoying form of anxiety. There's always going to be something that triggers it. There's always going to be something that you find on or about your body that makes you think bad things. It's exhausting. I probably get a small break in between panics, but it's never completely resolved. 
 

 I think if the bad things had very obvious symptoms and didn't share symptoms with harmless things, it wouldn't be a problem.
 

 Like, for bad things, you could ooze green slime or something. That would help a fucking lot."
"My friend has recently become engaged and is having an engagement party. It's been a long time since I've seen most of the people that will be at the engagement party so I'm nervous about seeing them again. I feel really anxious at the moment, do you have any tips for feeling less anxious about it?"
"In three weeks, I have to move to another city on my own and start my first job ever. I have to make phone calls to find an apartment and I HATE IT (phone calls give me huuuge anxiety and I don't know shit about rents). I keep thinking that I'll suck at this job and people will think I'm dumb. I'm going crazy with anxiety and I don't really know how to manage all this. I'm glad to have this opportunity to make my life better and a little bit more interesting, but god it's scary!! I hope I'll be ok!"
"I'm 26 years old and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. 
 I had to leave school a couple months into my 11th year just because my anxiety was so bad. I started doing homeschool but even that was just too much for me. That was 2013 ish. It hasn't gotten better it's only gotten worse and over the years I have just been living day by day. Thank God I was approved for SSI because I honestly don't know how I would have helped with some sort of income to help with the household. It got a little better somehow when covid started and believe it or not I got my GED and a job from home but then I don't know what happened it just started getting so bad again. 
 I don't leave my house, I have no friends, I still live with my parents. I've never been in love. 
 I feel so worthless right now. 
 

 Please don't tell me that it's all in my head because I've heard that my entire life and although it is I can't do anything about it. Currently on 20 mg of paxil daily. I've been diagnosed officially with agoraphobia w/ panic disorder, severe anxiety and depression. 
 

 I just want to better myself enough to where I don't feel like such a loss of a person. 
 

 Not seeing a psychiatrist or therapist (COVID stopped that but I'm definitely starting again soon)
 

 Is there anything anyone can tell me that might help? Is there anything I can do to make this better? Will it ever get better?"

"I have pretty bad anxiety and I have to get a wisdom tooth removed. I am not entirely sure if I want to be put under or not. Honestly, I don’t like the feeling of not being in control but I also don’t know if I’m ready to hear my whole tooth being taken out of my jaw. 
 

 I don’t take any anxiety meds I’ve only been using CBD occasionally and if I decide to stay awake I might take some CBD to calm my nerves. 
 

 Has anyone taken CBD before wisdom tooth extraction?

"Hello! 
 In the last 8 or so years I've developed intense anxiety about going to see a doctor about anything. It all started when I had to have emergency surgery. Lately ive realized that I need to make an appointment about a medical issue but I am scared. I also don't want the issue to persist or get worse. Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with the fear and anxiety? Does anyone else have the same fear? I want to be able to go without a total breakdown. 
 Thanks!"
"This shit makes me very scared, I don't know how to stop it and they appeared out of nowhere 10 days ago, I'm jus sitting on my bed or laptop and all of the sudden my heart beats super fast and I feel like its hard to breathe, I did x-ray scanning and checkup, doctor said nothing is serious and everything is fine , just a little tight airways, I've had this before (the tightness of breath) but NEVER heart palpitations 
 

 I have a history with anxiety and I took meds to treat it back in 2016, But never thought I'll be this anxious again. I'm super worried and uncomfortable and trying to understand where is this coming from. I'm 25 years old and married. I'm typing while my hear is beating fast. Sometimes I don't even know its beating fast until i think about it and it beats even faster after that.."
I feel like if someone were comfortable with me they would just randomly want to tell me a thought or anything but no one really stops to say anything to me. I’d say hi to a few people everyday but when i noticed they don’t go out there way to say hi to me first..i stopped. It’s almost embarrassing to be walking and talking with a co worker just for them to be a little reserved with me and then talk to someone else..even though i’m being open with them..like they are choosing them over me. There is one lady who will talk with me and be open with me like she is with everyone else and i’m not sure if this has anything to do with it but she has ptsd..and i know i have something similar from my childhood so maybe there’s a relation?
"From a young age I have been really interested in trying different psychoactive substances. I first smoked weed at a friend's house when I was 13. I thought I would eventually be able to try other drugs, especially psychedelics. But during my teens I stopped being able to make new friends due to anxiety and awkwardness, and of course you can't get drugs without connections. Now I'm 25 and friendless. Over the years I've tried things like Adderall and some opioids but I'm not really interested in that stuff. Instead I've turned to legal substances. I've taken a ton of diphenhydramine and it's not even a pleasant experience. I've used a good bit of dxm and had cool trips but nothing incredible. I of course can buy alcohol and now I have legal weed. But I have read so much about people's profound and crazy experiences from psychedelics and wanted for so long to have the experience myself. I'm too afraid to order off the net. I just wish it was legal and regulated so my social problems wouldn't be a hindrance."
"My current job is remote and today I needed to say a few words about myself to a group of 50 people on a video call, and it's probably the most public speaking I'll ever have to do here. But if I wanted to follow the career path that I'm considering at the moment, I feel like I won't be able to manage my SA. I don't want to waste more years of my life pursuing something that might turn out to be completely out of my reach.
 

 I feel hopeless and really tired of this life. I guess I could invest the money I'm making now into some sort of therapy, but then I wouldn't be able to move out. I'm 26 and all I wanted to do is to move out since I was like 12.
 

 Feel free to share or advise.
 

 Btw. I know my case is not the worst and I truly feel for those who have it worse but please don't gatekeep this sub from me"
"I (25f) was diagnosed with severe anxiety a couple of years ago. I have had bad anxiety since I can remember, especially obsessive thoughts/worrying/paranoia. I honestly also think I have OCD with emphasis on the O, however I am not officially diagnosed.
 

 After years of therapy I was actually managing, I rarely suffered panic attacks anymore etc. Last winter things started going bad again but mostly depression and some episodes of obsessive thinking but I knew what was causing it and i worked through it. But February I caught COVID and while I handled being sick and quarantine really well, my brain has been a dumpsterfire ever since I got ""healthy"" again. I showed symptoms of Post-Covid for a couple of weeks but I feel most of them are gone by now, however my anxiety is through the roof. I was under extreme stress at work directly after COVID so I thought that was causing it. But things are mostly settled now, i will even start a new job soon and my brain is still on fire. I am anxious about everything (and paranoid, but that mostly about work), my cognitive functions seem to be impaired (slow and forgetful) and because of a stupid tweet I read i am now worried that i have brain damage from the virus (embarrassing). I know very well that all the symptoms I have can also be attributed to GAD and depression but I can't remember being this unhinged ever since doing therapy so I am just wondering did anyone else experience this? And if you did, what helped?"
"I mean, I am 28 years old. It's been years since I started taking pills for my anxiety and going to therapy and stuff but I still having panic attacks and being extremely anxious over the bare minimum. Today I had a full panic attack at work and now I am embarassed and afraid of idk maybe losing my job or something because my anxiety is this endless snow ball that keep growing and growing... And I am so tired, guys. So tired."
"25M here, so as the title says, I started to wonder if there are any entrepreneurs or self-employed persons here who have social anxiety? How has that worked for you, or how you got into your position? I would be interested in hearing your experiences 🤔
 

 I have recently started to think more and more of self-employment but my SA and overall self-esteem have taken a very deep dive during covid which makes it a bit harder. I mean how could I sell my services if I don't have any trust in myself? 😄
 

 I'm just tired of working my ass of 9 to 5 living from paycheck to paycheck. I did not graduate from university for this 😂 But the idea of being an entrepreneur is quite scary too, since that would require a lot of interacting with new people and even worse for me, probably through phone calls."
I'm pretty relaxed right now. I'm working and focused on that. I hope everyone else is having a similar experience.

"So I started my new job as a receptionist this month, and I’m really anxious about getting things wrong. 
 

 I don’t have previous experience as a receptionist so it’s basically it’s my first time in this field. There’s a lot to learn and everyone’s really patient and kind at work.

"Iv been on Zoloft for about 1 1/2 years, and at 100mg for almost a year. I get panic attacks in certain social situations like speaking in front of others. I also have used Propranolol for the last 6 yrs or so when I know I’m going to have an ‘event’. Both meds definitely help me, the Zoloft makes me not worry about getting a panic attack and when some unexpected comes up and I use the propranolol when I know of something coming up. The problem is I’m trying to decide if the Zoloft is making me feel like I’m in a haze. It’s hard to explain, like my brain is just cloudy, I don’t have any strong feelings, though I’m generally not a very emotional person to began with. What are some of your thoughts on this? Have you gone down on your dose, or decided the haze isn’t too bad?"
"2 upper wisdom teeth grown well but was advised to be removed + 2 teeth lower teeth had growth a bit horizon and impact other teeth although no pain is yet being experienced from it. (Pain is only from my failed root canal teeth not related to any of those wisdom or impacted teeth)
 

 Can you please share your experience and if i'll be able to go through IV and remove 5 teeths at once?
 Or should I be more worried and postpone it (planned for the coming saturday)
 

 I am also a type of person that had not been able to swallow pills I simply crush them into water and swallow. My brain literally does not allow me to swallow pills like normal people and I am 25."
"This happens a lot because I’m a receptionist and I try to keep my voice friendly. I’m also younger than my coworkers and short and quiet, so I think my appearance/how I carry myself factors into it too. Nevertheless, it drives me up the wall. I’ve had instances where it takes a mountain of self control not to hang up on the person or excuse myself. I’ll be anxiously seething for hours afterward. Do I politely let them know to call me by name, or do I just ignore it?"
"Hello all!

"I took adderall for about 3-4 years and I feel like those were some of the best years so far (f26) I became somewhat reliant on adderall and decided to stop taking it last year around July. August rolls around and I experience my very first panic/anxiety attack and my life has been a daily struggle with anxiety. The only way I can’t really feel my anxiety is when I’m doing something fun with my friends or doing physical work of some kind. I need to be fully distracted by something else. This all sounds like not that big of a problem but it’s truly difficult to be alone with my own thoughts. 
 

 There is no such thing as relaxing anymore or taking a nap or just chilling out doing absolutely nothing because that’s when the anxiety and scary thoughts start to creep in.  
 

 I also somewhat feel like a shell of a human. The only emotion I feel is anxiety. Even when I’m having fun with friends it can be hard to register the feeling of fun. 
 

 I don’t know exactly what to do. I don’t want to take anxiety medication because I don’t want to become reliant like I was on adderall. 
 

 Has anyone gone through anything similar?"

"This is kinda petty but my brain just won’t stop worrying. See I’ve been with my boyfriend for about 5 months now. We only message through text and see eachother once a week but that usually works for us. Well we often tell eachother we love each other, but this week he hasn’t said it once, and I may not be able to see him this weekend cause he’s getting the vaccine shot and might be affected by the side effects.
 

 Anyway, I know he loves me, he’s done so many romantic and loving things for me. So why does not hearing him say it at least once this week make me worry he’s losing interest when I know for a fact that’s not the case… (ps I must emphasize he’s shy so I understand why he doesn’t say it as often as I do…)
 

 Basically… anxiety is the annoying nag that tries and almost succeeds in making me doubt reality"
"I sort of managed to function at a decent level until my anxiety and depression took over my life after starting uni. I struggled with it prior to uni but since there wasn't a constant pressure I managed to keep it somewhat under control. Probably also helped that I was living ""alone"". I'm now finishing my first year post uni and my levels of anxiety and depression are the same as during the course. I live with my partner and I (we) really struggle with keeping the house clean. I get so overwhelmed and I realise that there are certain criterias that needs to be met in order for me to have some energy to clean, e.g not keeping the dirty dishes in the sink, but my partner keeps doing it anyway and I feel further overwhelmed. He does help to clean btw but also not... We are probably equally bad - he also suffers from. Anxiety, add and is also an only child (never really sure what is a result of what - does he not throw stuff in the bin because of add or is it because he is used. To his mom doing it (cuz she does)) 
 

 I last week we had a tidy up together and it felt nice, I asked him if we could please continue to do all the tasks I find the most challenging together but when I asked for help again a few days later he didn't feel like it and all the tiny bits of ""energy"" I had worked up disappeared.
 

 I'm not sure what I'm asking here, just feeling hopeless and helpless because I feel like the only way I might be able to keep stuff sort of tidy would be by living alone but that's kinda not an option... I feel like a child... (I'm 25 BTW)"

After some minutes I went close to my crush and I asked can I hug you? And she rejected!

"I’m a 33M and I’m freaking out, I have blood on my stool and what I think are thin stool. It doesn’t look pencil like, but I believe the are thin. I don’t have any other symptoms. I’m really scared I’ve an 8 month old daughter and I don’t want to be dealing with this.
 

 I’m getting blood work done tomorrow and hopefully getting a referral for a colonoscopy.
 

 What are my chances of being Colon cancer ? I have no family history.
 

 I’m so sad and scared"

"I have mild fear of tall buildings and height in general..It is my recent phobia ,had no problem before 
 

 Currently I live in a small town with small buildings but I want to move to bigger cities in future
 

 what can I do to deal with this fear except visualizing and watching videos ? ( I love far away from psychologist so this option is currently unavailable)"
"I have far of being judged in general but this particular thought ,,what will people say about me if they find out that I have severe anxiety '' is what bothers me the most.I imagine that they will judge me harshly or they will gossip about me ,or they will decide that I am broken person
 

 i know my fear is not logical ,I mean come on why should I worry if someone judges me for my anxiety but we know that our fears do not make sense even to ourselves 
 

 Does anyone know of any mental exercise which will help me to care less about peoples opinions ?I am sure there are some out there .."

"I am not English. sorry for my bad English. I hope you guys can understand. I am 30 now and my first panic attack started when I was 21. I used to smoke weed very occasionally. One of my friend once told me, he felt like he couldn't breathe after smoking weed. That was in my mind and the same started to happen to me later. 
 

 Last i smoked weed was 2 years ago. My HR was 140 and I felt like i was about to die. But, then I felt like i have some heart conditions. Because, my watch used to show 80-95 HR most of the time. My resting HR however when I wake up or if I lie down for 20-30 minutes is 65-70. I was afraid to go to a hospital to check my heart and I bought an ECG monitor, at first I was scared and it showed I have Tachichardia (Hr was 140) after a minute or so, it was normal and was in 80s range. 
 

 I was scared to take covid vaccination because of the bullshit news that I read, some people died after vaccination. For travel reasons. I was forced to get vaccinated. I am pretty sure, my HR was 140+ during my first dose. As soon as she injected the vaccine. I got so relieved like she took a bullet that was stuck in my heart. Second dose was way much better. But, still was scared as fuck. 
 

 Today was watching some movie. Some war scene and HR got really high. Even with some gaming my HR goes high. Very very rarely other than this, I get some panic attacks. I should say, this happened only 2 or 3 times and that was 6 months ago. 
 

 Should I stop monitoring my watch for HR? ( That was a trigger too)
 A doctor suggested me antidepressant tablets. Should I start taking any medication? I am afraid that, i might get addicted to those. 
 

 Anything related to my health. I am getting paranoid. I don't know what to do."

"I have been dealing with severe health anxiety for about 4-5 years straight, but have had slight symptoms since age 19, I'm 31 now btw. It really got out of control when I got diagnosed with PTSD and started doing EMDR for it in 2018. It's manifested in various forms since then, mouth cancer, skin cancer, lupus, MS, fibromyalgia, Als, etc ... I don't really have an intense fear of dying, but I do have an intense fear of permanent or long term suffering. I have a fear of things that will cause me long term emotional and physical pain like disabling conditions, deformities, conditions that cause excruciating pain, visible conditions like tumors, etc... I just can't do it anymore though. I feel like I am not myself anymore, I don't even know who I am. I've been in therapy, I take medication, but I feel like I can no longer trust my body. It feels like my body is just out to get me, like every thing bad that I read on Google is gonna happen to me. I look at my skin all of the time, my body, my hair, etc... Just can't do it. I can't deal with having a body anymore."
"I 30F have been struggling with IBS and anxiety. I know my anxiety flares up my IBS but I’m not in a position where I can go to the toilet when I need to at work, which starts a horrific cycle of panic attacks, then upset stomach, then more panic.
 

 What ways do you know of to help with the anxiety of not being able to go to the toilet when I need it. Sometimes I can’t just push through the panic."
"So I have been bullied for years in the past. Over the last year or so of my life, I am finally starting to let these feelings in, trying to deal with them.
 

 It has left me with great social anxiety. I always feel watched, I feel constantly on edge to be whatever people ""expect"" me to be. Why? That feeling of being in a classroom and having everyone look down on you. Have everyone belittle you, threaten you. Going outside in my town and constantly being scared of the ""cool"" kids wanting to shame me or beat me up. It has taught me a pattern of behaviour where I am constantly looking around me to see what the ""crowd"" expects and then act on it, to be high on the social pecking order.
 

 It has taught me to look at ""being a man"" the way popular culture defined it when I was young, the way my environment did. Being a tough guy who punched other dudes in the face and pleasures many women sexually. Basically that is it, very narrow minded. I am learning slowly to view myself in a different light. Being a man means I face my fears and do things regardless. It means I better myself as a human being. I means I care for others and take care of myself. It means I make the right choices, even though they are hard. It means I love myself for who I am, and enable others to do the same. It means I don't put others down for their imperfections, and also not putting myself down for mine. It means I love myself regardless of others judging me.
 

 The past still haunts me, but I hope letting the feelings in will slowly dissipate them and give me a chance to live without fear of others' judgement. I hope one day my anxiety about being 'low' on the social order will reach manageble proportions.
 

 Just needed to get this off my chest. If anyone relates or has tips, I would love to hear them."
"So I have finally made the decision to talk to my doctor about medication for my anxiety. I'm 31 years old, I've suffered with social anxiety since I was very little and I've finally had enough. It's time to stop letting anxiety control my life. I'm wondering which medications you found helped the most with your anxiety so I can maybe mention some of these to my doctor."

"I(30f) have been struggling with anxiety since I was a kid. Always had stomach aches and stomach ulcers, doctors told my mom it was anxiety but I was never treated for it. It wasn’t terrible in my teens, but I always struggled with sleep issues because i was always stressing about something. 
 It really ramped up after I got married and moved away from my family, I tried to get jobs but I was too anxious to follow up after interviews. We struggled financially, which caused a lot of extra stress and my husband’s mental health was not great. After some incidents while he was in the military, he was put in a therapy program and it really helped him. His therapist suggested I also seek treatment, but I never did. While waiting for him to get out of the military, I moved back home and returned to my old job which led to an new job offer that I ended up loving. 
 After my second baby was born, my anxiety went wild. I quit my job to stay home because I was struggling so much, my baby was exclusively BF and refused bottles, and I was terrified to put my babies in a day care center. I had severe panic attacks regularly, I thought I was losing my mind. I stopped talking to most of my friends because I didn’t have the energy to try to talk to anyone and I believe I was suffering from PPD. I didn’t talk to anyone about it and it was causing a lot of tension between my husband and I. 
 Fast forward a couple years later, husband has a good paying job with good job security and we are financially stable now, but he works a lot and has to travel a lot out of state and occasionally out of the country. Anxiety began to worsen the more I was home alone for more than a couple days at a time and the stress trying to maintain my home while my toddlers destroyed it was hitting me hard. Husband and I had an argument and he told me it was time to deal with my anxiety because it was impacting my daily life and affecting our relationship. I still didn’t, I just tried to hide it around him when he was home, but he was gone most of that time for work.
 My husband has been so supportive and tries to be understand, he tries to do things to make my life easier and makes sure that i get some time to myself on his day off. I’m so thankful for him and I feel terrible for letting this go on so long. 
 I’m so proud to say that I made an appointment last week and finally talked to someone about what I’ve been dealing with. We talked about a treatment plan, she recommended we start with lexapro and therapy. I cried after my appointment, it felt like a huge weight fell off of my shoulders talking to someone about it."
"I’ve (F31) had anxiety for pretty much my whole life, and depression off and on for a decade, but both have been manageable for the most part. I was diagnosed with a health condition 2 months ago, and also stopped dating a guy I really liked around the same time.
 

 Since then, my anxiety and depression have been all over the place for a month, with mood swings from thinking “I’m fine.” to anxiety, to depression, to worrying I’m gonna have a psychotic break bc I feel so “out of it” (which is probably just the anxiety again). I began therapy and on the third session, I said I kept feeling anxious and then depressed, and then one thought I was gonna lose my mind bc of how high my anxiety was, and then gradually felt better. The therapist said it sounds like a mood disorder and that she doesn’t wanna scare me but it might be bipolar and that a psychiatrist can check if it’s bipolar by giving me an SSRI and seeing if it makes me manic.
 

 I’m open to medication but now I’m terrified bc if I do have bipolar, I don’t want to trigger a manic episode with an SSRI and then have to be on a stronger med, but also don’t want to start off with a strong med like Abilify right off the bat just to avoid being manic.
 

 I never thought I was bipolar but now I’m hyperaware of any symptoms bc of my health anxiety. Any thoughts or comments are appropriated."
"Just wanted to give a shoutout to this great podcast by Caroline Foran. Specifically, the episode titled ""Real Time Rescue for a Panic Attack."" I listened to it while I was experiencing a panic attack at home and found it so helpful. Caroline's voice is super calming, but I also felt completely seen, heard, and validated as she described why I was feeling the things that I was. She also walked through some breathing exercises. 
 

 The other episodes include guests and logically, rationally explain why we experience anxiety/panic - if you're like me, this can be really helpful (not while I'm actively having a panic/anxiety attack, but when I'm a bit calmer). Just wanted to share in case someone else finds it useful!"
"I've suffered with anxiety for as long as I can remember. It stems from having a severely ill younger brother and mother growing up. I was constantly worried about them and I've became a hypochondriac. I'm 33 now and have a beautiful son, aged 3.
 

 However, lately, I've suffered some personal disappointments and on top of that, I've had a problem with a tooth that had to be extracted. I know that may not sound like a big deal to some people, but it's terrifying for me. Every ache or pain I have I immediately go to worst-case scenarios. It's so draining and I can't focus on being the dad I know I am. I just want to be well - physically and mentally. I'm so frightened of physical problems it's ridiculous. What can I do? I feel like I'm spiralling here. I've done therapy in the past, and it has helped, so maybe I need to look at that again."
Does anyone else feel embarrassed about not driving? I'm 31 and even though I have my licence I find it really hard to drive. Once someone's behind me my anxiety gets bad. I feel like people are always surprised and some definitely judge me. Part of me doesn't care but I really do want to drive and be less dependent on public transport. I'm starting to drive again slowly but it just sucks. Feels impossible that I'll ever feel confident enough to be on the road by myself
Currently I’m in Texas and my family is all in the northeast. I’m starting to really think a lot about this (I’m 27) but I also don’t want to live in the north east. I don’t even really know what I want but I am just sad all the time.
"Hello fellow sufferers,
 

 So I suffered some overwhelming anxiety and panic attacks when I was in my late teens (34M now). Got on lexapro for maybe six months at that time. I felt much better so I quit it cold turkey. Since then, I've been in pretty good shape mentally, aside from a couple episodes of moderate anxiety in my early twenties. Like really, I've dealt with relationships and life stresses and all that and have been doing just fine.
 

 Fast forward to now. I dated this woman for a couple months and really started to fall for her. She just wasn't feeling it I guess so she ended it. About a week before she broke it off I could tell something was wrong. It was around that time that I started to feel really anxious. I even had some mild panic attacks that week. The first one I was just laying on the couch playing on my phone and I felt this uneasiness creep up on me and overwhelm me. It lasted about and hour. That happened one or two more times that week. I started having trouble sleeping too. After she ended things, it all got worse. 
 

 I started to just feel so anxious all the time and was really obsessing over the relationship, like wondering what went wrong and hoping she would call me, ya know. My apatite was shot and I could only get 3-5 hours of sleep a night. I lost interest in doing anything. After about a month and a half of feeling this way I started to eat normally and the anxiety quieted down a bit. I was thinking about her much less but I still wasn't sleeping well at all but I was just left with some slight depression. I started a new job three weeks ago and then the anxiety hit hard again. It has been really intense and I've been having some panic attacks every couple days. Most days I feel on edge and hopeless at the same time. I nearly quit my job the second day because I just couldn't handle this feeling. 
 

 Like I said, I'm been doing just fine mentally for the past 15 or so years but I've been wrecked these past few months. 
 

 Please help me with any advice you might have for me. I'm afraid I'll have to live like this forever and I can't stand it. It's so overwhelming at times. I tell myself that I was fine before this relationship and that is what triggered it so I should be able to recover from this."
"I've always had health anxiety but it's been so much worse in the past year. I've been convinced something is wrong with me since November 2020. I've gone through the worst possible scenario for multiple things and nothing is wrong with me. However, my latest concern is colon cancer.
 

 How ridiculous, I'm 34. Why would I have colon cancer? Well, there are signs of it that I am experiencing. It doesn't help that colon cancer has become more common in younger people (one I used to work with has stage IV colon cancer, and one of my friends lost his friend in their late 30s to colon cancer).
 

 I'm convinced that this is the overall culprit and the anxiety feeds on it which makes me feel worse. The only thing that can give me answers is what I am waiting for: a colonoscopy. Ugh.
 

 I hate anxiety. I hate health anxiety. I hate being terrified of what likely isn't wrong but could be wrong...."
"Me and my brothers all have ha to varying degrees, idk if it's genes or just our upbringing.
 

 I think growing up isolated, locked indoors and forced to study all the time just makes you neurotic in general, not just about health.
 

 How close is this to your life?"
"Hello! I dealt with some anxiety my late teens but have been pretty well off up until now. I 34m now. I recently went through a break up where I really liked the woman and was super hopeful about the relationship but I guess she just wasn't feeling it so she ended it. It really tore me up. More than I expected it would and more then anything like that has before.
 

 That caused my anxiety to come roaring back like crazy. It's been 2.5 months and I am very often on edge and sometimes have prolonged panic attacks where I feel like I'm in fight or flight mode full on. I also have a lot of trouble sleeping and am starting to have sleep anxiety. I often have adrenaline rushed throughout the day and at night.
 

 Help! What should I do? Am I stuck like this now? I just want to go back to normal!"
"i am 30 and I am extremely shy and have a lot of social anxiety. I am scared to tell my coworkers that my brother lives in the US for fear they will google him. He lives in the same city as my companys headquarters in the US. He did a phd in his field and he would be easily searchable. Scared they will judge me and say he is rich for example because of where he works. He has a very top position in his field. I am also scared of them finding it weird of why i have not shared this with them before. 
 

 I am also nervous of sharing with people the high school i went to as it is a private school. I am scared they will judge me as wealthy for havkng gone there. I feel really guilty of being more well off than my peers 
 

 Does anyone have any help? How can i stop worrying so much what people think of me? I am seeing a therapist and i started taking medication.
 

 Any advice?"

 It sucks cos I have never met a single personal person like me and whenever I'm around other people they look at me wide eyed like ""what's wrong with this guy"" then I have to explain I have social anxiety and I hate living like this
 

 Went to the doctor today and first the nurse was asking me questions and I stuttered and couldn't think clearly and said words in the wrong order and he was like whaat?
 

 Then the doctor saw me and she also made me feel even worse"
"I cannot seem to catch a break at all. I have struggled with health issues the past year and a half which keeps setting my anxiety off. I'm miserable. Now I seem to have issues emptying my bladder completely.
 

 The worst part about all of what I've been going through is doctors can't find anything wrong. Then my anxiety tells me that the problem is because they are missing something and it continually eats away at me.
 

 Damn, this sucks."
"Does anyone else get jolts of almost painful anxiety when trying to nap? Like when you’re so exhausted you can barely keep your eyes open to then snapping back awake, heart racing, chest pain?

"Hi everyone.
 

 30M here. I was diagnosed with Panic Disorder and SAD since 12. Prozac and Benzos made me a whole different person.
 

 I was able to have many friends and girlfriends during the whole time I took my medication. Then I became againts medication and many other things to increase my spiritual energy. I stopped my medication with no issues or withdrawal.
 

 Long story short: I can live without SSRIs, but I would be completely shy, I cannot get out in dates, I would not be able to have a family because of the stress. Now I do not have ANY worries in my life, no debts, no children, nothing. And I still get anxiety for very small things.
 

 Even if I find a SO now, new things would give me stress and I would definitely need Prozac.
 

 I cannot take any other SSRI because they make feel like a Zombie, only Prozac doesn't.
 

 If I take Prozac, my life changes completely. I go from introvert to extrovert. I get too many dates and friends and believe, at least in MY CASE, nothings helps me, no therapy, no tea, nothing.
 

 So, I am trying to decide to have a normal life and date girls again on Prozac, or live a lonely life full of anxiety and fear.
 

 What I do not like is the sexual side effects of Prozac which affects me to some degree but it is not imposible to orgasm.
 

 But what is the point to have orgasms if I have no one to do it with? Only masturbating.
 

 Also, I do not know how long will I live, so if I live only 5 more years or 50 years, would I choose to live it alone with fear and anxiety, or should I live life like a normal person, but taking a pill a day?
 

 I'm struggling with it and decide what to do"
"I have been diagnosed last year but I've had anxiety related symptoms since october 2019 but before that moment I experienced a few episodes of something that is similar to a panic attack but it didn't feel like that and now I'm wondering if those might have been panic symptoms or something else totally unrelated to anxiety.What I felt was (in ored of appearance):
 

 * nauseous and maybe a bit dizzy (one time I kneeled on the wc because I really thought I was gonna throw up)
 * feeling of losing consiousness (I felt the absolute need of lying down on the bed otherwise I felt that I might really fainted)
 * Consequently I felt of course a bit scared because I didn't know for how much long this would go on
 * When I lay down on a bed i start to sweat and hearth goes faster
 

 One time this happened before I had to go to uni, at it manifested as soon I stood up from the bed. I remember texting my friend to tell him that I was not going to be at class that day. Then I went to bed, felt the last thing of the list above and fell asleep. 2h later I woke up feeling ok, good. I went back at the phone and I saw that I texted my friend random words that didn't make sense (""send notes from the pdf blackboard professor"" something like that) that I did not remember typing, meaning that I was also probably a bit blacking out and really on the verge of losing consciousness.
 

 Another time this happend was when I was on a trip with friends, it happened again as soon as I stood up from the bed, I immediately felt that something was wrong. The same thing happened but this time I couldn't sleep. I waited in bed for 10/15minutes and I went for breakfast. I still felt ""stunned/confused"" like if I still was on the road of losing consciousness. I did not eat and speak much, in the car it slowly start to get a bit better and eventually it went away, leaving me with a headache. But i was scared of going through the day in this conditions, eventually being distracted by it helped me. Probably the cause of this was that I slept 2 hours more or less, it was hot and I ate too much the dinner before.
 

 I was wondering if anyone of you have any clue if these episodes are or are not related to anxiety/panic.
 

 By confronting with the definition of panic attack I highlighted the ones that I feel that I've felt:""According to DSM-5, a panic attack is characterized by four or more of the following symptoms (the presence of fewer than four symptoms may be considered a limited-symptom panic attack):
 

 * Palpitations, pounding heart, or **accelerated heart rate**
 * **Sweating**
 * Trembling or shaking ***(more like weak legs, but not always)***
 * Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering
 * A feeling of choking
 * Chest pain or discomfort
 * **Nausea** or abdominal distress
 * Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or **faint**
 * Feelings of unreality (derealization) or being detached from oneself (depersonalization)
 * **Fear of losing control** ***(maybe, not sure)*** or going crazy
 * Fear of dying
 * Numbness or tingling sensations (paresthesias)
 * Chills or hot flushes""
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 By confronting with the definition of fainting:
 

 ""The symptoms of a faint include:
 

 * Dizziness
 * **Light-headedness**
 * A pale face
 * **Perspiration**
 * **Heightened anxiety** and restlessness
 * **Nausea**
 * **Collapse** ***(kind of)***
 * **Unconsciousness** ***(kind of)***, for a few seconds
 * Full recovery after a few minutes."""
"I am 33 yrs old and for about a year now i have had debilitating anxiety i have shortness of breath and now all of a sudden im clostrophobic i get dizzy and my heart races fast also nausea my doctor says its anxiety but i never believed him but maybe it can be , i just never knew it can be this real"

"For example this happened the other day while driving to class. The week before (first week of the course) sometimes I was pretty nervous, agitated and generally anxious during the drive, resulting in a weird feeling that I usually feel in this circumstances (it's hard to put it to words, like an ""uneasy/rushy/in real-time"" sense of reality).
 

 This time I didn't feel any of that, I was actually close to being symptomless. The problem is that when I started noticing this too much my brain started to ""scan"" and check for that feeling that I described before. Even tho I didn't eventually feel it again, it did ruin the moment and it impacted a bit on the symptoms anyway.
 

 So, how can I just let go generally speaking?"
"My girlfriend has suffered some serious trauma in the past and suffers from pretty serious anxiety and sometimes depression now. She also has a problem where when she goes out with friends she always blacks out and then feels very anxious and depressed for multiple days after.
 

 She blacked out again last night (after assuring me she wouldn’t even drink) and now says that sometimes she doesn’t know if I’m real or if she’s real. 
 

 I just don’t know how to handle this as it’s become a huge burden on our relationship, and I’m especially concerned now that she mentioned these symptoms of depersonalization."
"I went through a chill, short term relationship break up three months ago which shouldn't have really even affected me but somehow it has thrown me into a spiral of overwhelming anxiety. I have difficulty sleeping and functioning with feelings or derealization and a constant sense of doom. I can honestly barely function. For the last 15 years before this I have been completely normal feeling and could easily overcome stress. 
 

 I did have a 6 month or so episode of anxiety when I was 18 where I was put on Lexapro for a short time. I overcame it and was fine ever since. 34m now.
 

 I now have a prescription sitting here but I dont want to give in to this anxiety.
 

 Any thoughts on why this happened to me and if I should just start the meds."
"I (34F) am currently stuck in a job/field I hate. I am a healthcare worker and I am desperately wanting to get out and do something else. The problem is I don't know where to go or what to do. I am terrified of ending up in the same place with another career or job (basically having a mental break down at work because of being unable to handle the stress of it). I have never been good at multi-tasking or a lot of pressure which makes me hesitant to try new fields. I have little to no faith in myself or my abilities and it's held me back a lot in life. I don't take failure well and it pretty much sends me into a spiral. I have been to two different therapists who really didn't do much for me and I am already on an anti-depressant. At this point, I feel like I just need to try it on my own. Any suggestions for books to read, videos to watch, coping strategies, or CBT worksheets would be greatly appreciated."
"I've always had anxiety issues. As a kid, I thought that I was normal and everyone felt this way.... Dry heaving in the car on the way to a new babysitters house. 
 I'm 33 now and I still have constant anxiety. The last three months have been worse than anything prior. The only time I feel slightly normal is when I take a Xanax. My Dr said that they're addictive, so it's a short term solution. I have been off of work (on and off) for two months. My Dr gave me Zoloft and I've been on it for a week and a half and I'm still somewhat hopeful that it'll kick in but idk what I'll do if it doesn't help substantially."

"95% of the symptoms I experience regarding the anxiety disorder (specifically they are more dpdr oriented) are just mental. They can be thoughts or alterations of perception, like if life is moving in ""real-time"" (probably has to do with stress), feeling fucked up to look or think about my face or my parents' faces, or feeling ""stunned"".
 

 The thing is that my therapist told me that it's impossible, there must be a correlation between body and mind but it doesnt feel like that. I can be physically and mentally calm but still experience those fucked up sensations. I feel that he doesn't know what he is talking about.
 

 The same goes for depression actually. Someone can be diagnosed with it and not necessarly have fatigue or low energy, maybe they only have the mental aspect of the disorder, like no enjoyment or pleasure in life and feelings of hopelessness."
"I (F31) previously posted about health anxiety and my worry of taking an SSRI. I finally took the leap and took half a pill of Lexapro today (I took 5mg) as per my psychiatrist's order. An hour after i took it, while asking someone if they've had side effects of nausea or dizziness, i began feeling a bit nauseous, dizzy, chest tightness, chest pain, pain in my heart. That then made my health anxiety worse OF COURSE. That was about 1.5 hours ago, and the pain has been gone fora long time, but i still have a ""sensation"" in my chest. I'm not looking for any advice or anything, but just to vent and see if anybody else has had similar issues when dealing with health anxiety and starting a new med for that anxiety, and then going into this anxiety cycle.
 

 I'm sooo sick of my anxiety and just want to get it under control already!!!"
"I (31F) don’t have an anxiety disorder myself, but my boyfriend of seven years (35M) has struggled with it his entire life. As he’s gotten older he’s lost the ability to self-manage and recently started an SSRI due to having several panic attacks a few days in a row. They seem to be pretty general and not necessarily triggered by specific events.
 

 Those of you with panic attacks and anxiety, what kind of support do you find encouraging from your loved ones? I’d like to help him if I can, even if helping means stepping back, but it’s hard for him to articulate what he needs in the moment. Are there strategies that you find helpful for you as a couple or family?"
"My ex and I were in a pretty intense relationship from January 2021 to November 2021. He broke up with me out of the blue, for various reasons, and then moved out of our apartment. It was the first time in my life that someone I loved broke up with me.
 

 I have not been able to function normally since.
 

 I couldn't eat for 3 weeks, and then I had to be on Xanax and other medication to force me to eat. I cry non stop, randomly or every time I randomly hear from him. I can't get out of bed in the morning. I have anxiety all day. The little things that used to make me smile, laugh or make me happy, no longer do. Sometimes the anxiety is so strong I have to lay down or sit down in foetal position.
 

 What worries me right now is my appetite. I couldn't eat at all after the breakup, then I started eating again a little bit, but now it's gone again. I have this weird feeling that I'm hungry, yet I don't want to eat anything. Whenever I eat, there's just no pleasure with it. I just do it to ease my stomach. Sometimes I don't eat for days.
 

 I'm seeing a therapist to help me accept the end of this relationship. I know the reason why I can't let go is because perhaps I still haven't accepted it. I'm trying to accept the relationship is over and he's not coming back, but I've made so many mistakes it takes more time for me to accept it.
 

 My therapist made it clear I did not suffer from depression as of now, as this state fluctuates. Indeed, there *are* days where I feel like I'm okay and I eat normally, but other days aren't.
 

 Since therapy takes time and it will take time for me to get better, **I'd like to know some tips in the meantime that can help me speed up the process and help me find some peace of mind, at least to make me eat again.**
 

 I used to be such a happy, bubbly, ambitious, life-loving person before meeting this man, and I want to go back the way I was. I'm at a prime time of my life, with very challenging professional opportunities and a comfortable financial situation, yet there is a part of me who want to enjoy it and make it my priority, but I can't."
"30M. I was diagnosed with Panic disorder and GAD including social anxiety. 5 years ago, I stopped taking my medication: Prozac 20mg a day, and Xanax when needed.
 

 These 5 years I have developed Panic attacks, Anxiety, stomach issues, and heart palpitations. At this moment, my anxiety is crippling and now I cannot even go out in dates, or to the gym, or any social activity because my anxiety will make me overthink for several days before the event and trigger panic attacks.
 

 The doctors have run many tests on me and nothing is wrong, and they tell me it is anxiety and I know it because it has happened to me before.
 

 I have not taken the medication during these years because I was trying to find something else that could be causing this problem, like gluten, dairy, or any other food allergy. And nothing worked. 
 

 I tried meditation, teas, and a million more things and they help a bit but the panic attacks and anxiety is still there.
 

 I became lonely, shy and depressed because I could not go out and meet new people because of my anxiety. I was just surviving everyday. This is enough!
 

 I do not know how much time I have left. I may have thirty or fifty more years to live or more. Or maybe just one more year, no one knows. But what is life if you cannot actually live it? Will I continue in this anxiety black hole for my entire life? Not anymore.
 

 I decided to take Prozac again and start living. I want to spend all the days, months or years I have left with no anxiety and enjoying life. The only side effect I get is delayed ejaculation, but what is the point in ejaculating fast, if I can only do it by masturbating because my anxiety does not let me meet girls? What is the point of not taking my medication and being lonely in my room playing video games and rejecting invitations from some of my few friends who ask me to go to the movie theater or any other activity? I want to go out, travel, go to the gym, etc.
 

 That is why I started Prozac again and be the social, happy and extrovert man I used to be years ago.
 

 Life is short, I advise you to search for medical help if you feel that your anxiety has become crippling like mine and is stopping you to enjoy life the way it should be."
"Hi ladies and gentlemen. It my first time posting but have been following along for awhile. 33m in Georgia and have suffered what I believe (never been to the doctor to be diagnosed) to be anxiety and panic attacks on and off for the past 5-6 years. I'm currently going through a 3 month spell with it and have gotten to the point I don't want to leave my house period, like not even go outside. My question is, has or does anyone use a telehealth program and if so seeing as I haven't seen a doctor in person for diagnoses would I even be eligible for such treatment? If you think this could be a option for me would you have any recommendations on which company and maybe some ideas of what I could expect on my first video visit as the whole doctor thing in person or on the phone freaks me out pretty good. Thanks and hope to hear from you wonderful people."
"I've missed out on so many gigs in my life because I've been too anxious to go by myself and my taste in music is somewhat obscure. I've convinced my boyfriend to come with me many times but he doesn't really enjoy them so I'm going solo tonight.
 

 I would love some gentle encouragement because I can't stop thinking about how anxious I am. I've taken some CBD oil and I'm having a bath just to try and relax. Its not a huge venue - capacity is 300 but ive never been to this particular venue before and not being familiar with it is probably the part that's making me feel the worst. 
 

 I'm not too concerned about safety, I trust the staff are always looking out for dodgy behaviour and the place is pretty small. I'm mainly worried about standing out because I'm alone and potentially getting lost while I'm inside (navigational skills of a loaf of bread here).
 

 Thanks for reading, just wanted to get that off my chest and into the ether."
"I am 32 year old male, 5’8 weighting 182 lbs. 
 For the last year I have been constant in the gym 5 times a week hitting heavy weights and cardio. Starting to see my 6 pack again and I have been feeling the best since high school. I am the healthiest eater in my circle of friends and family, I eat lots of vegetables, fish, chicken, turkey, brow rice etc. I also Drink wine/beer on off days from gym which are 1-2 days a week and occasional pasta, steak, and whatnot.
 

 For my curiosity I went and got a blood work done to see where I stood. I was surprised and sad to find out my numbers.
 

 Total Cholesterol 254
 

 Triglycerides 129
 

 HDL 46
 

 LDL 185
 

 

 My doctor did not seem to worried and only told me to take fish oil and Niacin and that we will retest in 3 months. He did mention he is only worried about LDL number, and for me not to worry at all and let him worry.
 

 I have removed alcohol, simple carbs, and red meat 110% from my diet. I eat only vegetables, fruits, oats, and good fats (avocados, nuts, evoo)
 

 I am afraid I will not be able to enjoy life again and am worried I am not eating correctly by completely eliminating things that were once my normal life, despite feeling healthy. 
 

 I dont want this number to completely control me."
"I exercise 3 times a week and even when I don't, I always go for a 40-45 minute walk every day.
 

 I read some books on different psychology topics, they were helpful but of course it's not that they will magically make anxiety and dpdr disappear, and they all seemed a bit too much superficial.
 

 I am doing mindfullness every day almost (maybe I can work on quality and duration).
 

 I have always had a good diet, never drink coffee, alcohol or other drugs.
 

 Been on therapy for 1 year and it feels just a waste of money.
 

 I am starting to feel hopeless, I don't know what more I can do, I'm sick of just surviving and fighting always with this bs symptoms. What have I even done to deserve this?"
"Hi everyone - forgive the brevity, I've pretty much copied notes from previous Dr appointments as it's all I can manage RN but was hoping for some input. I am 33 year old male experiencing symptoms of;
 

 Decreased cognitive ability/executive functioning
 

 Constant exhaustion / fatigue
 

 Permanently on edge &amp; jumpy/unable to settle myself 
 

 Irritable/ low tolerance of music, TV &amp; general noise 
 

 Digestive issues
 

 Finally I have developed a strange 'tick' of constantly flicking my tongue against my bottom teeth from the moment I wake up until I sleep!
 

 This has been ongoing for almost 3 years now and I haven't received a formal diagnosis as my symptoms seem to overlap with anxiety, depression and ADD. I have been prescribed various medications including :
 

 Citalopram, Sertraline, Mirtazapine, Fluoxetine, Clomipramine, Buspirone, Pregabalin, Vortioxetine, Venlafaxine
 

 I have been having regular psychotherapy sessions as well but my symptoms are mainly physical. I would love some sort of diagnosis and guidance regarding medication and I seem to be getting nowhere with my current healthcare provider.
 

 Appreciate any input thanks!"
"I (30F) have had my license since I was 19 and I can count the number of times I've driven on the freeway on one hand. 
 

 I've been in two accidents (on neighborhood streets) and am just so scared of the freeway speeds and the possibility of an accident. I have successfully been able to avoid having to drive on freeway as I've always worked very close to where I live. And except for a year and a half in college, I was either living at home or married so my spouse now drives the freeway for us. 
 

 We now have a young baby and I know I HAVE to get over this fear. If you have any advice please send it my way because I have such bad anxiety surrounding this. My heart pounds, my hands sweat, and I avoid it at all costs. I'm wanting to drive somewhere this weekend that is 90 minutes away by freeway. Normally my husband would drive us but I'm wanting to try... Just need advice and encouragement."
"i am 30 and I am extremely shy and have a lot of social anxiety. I am scared to tell my coworkers that my brother lives in the US for fear they will google him. He lives in the same city as my companys headquarters in the US. He did a phd in his field and he would be easily searchable. Scared they will judge me and say he is rich for example because of where he works. He has a very top position in his field. I am also scared of them finding it weird of why i have not shared this with them before. 
 

 I am also nervous of sharing with people the high school i went to as it is a private school. I am scared they will judge me as wealthy for havkng gone there. I feel really guilty of being more well off than my peers 
 

 Does anyone have any help? How can i stop worrying so much what people think of me? I am seeing a therapist and i started taking medication.
 

 Any advice?"

"Firstly I’m all for masturbation and self love and all the rest of it. However I have bad anxiety, intrusive thoughts and retroactive jealousy disorder. She recently got a couple of sex toys for just her self pleasure and says it’s a bigger release when she’s on her own etc etc. I’m not worried she masturbates, I’m worried that I’m not enough and that she watches or looks at other things. I don’t watch porn or masturbate other than our own videos and stuff. I trust her that she wouldn’t do anything she considers cheating but I’m just really struggling with being ok with not knowing what she does. Any help is appreciated, please no insults as I’m kinda fragile haha"
"Due to my anxiety and the total breakdowns and panic it causes I’ve had some friends tell me I’m weird/crazy. It makes me feel hurt, embarrassed, and ashamed."
"I finally messaged my doctors office about scheduling an appointment to get my meds adjusted. I've been on Zoloft since I was in middle school (I'm 30 now) and Welbutrin since I was a freshman in college. I think I'm at the max dose but it literally feels like I'm not even taking my meds. I can't relax or calm down. 
 

 Everything is sensory overload to me right now. I've literally had panic attacks every day for like a month now. Certain noises set it off which sucks because my house is always busy and I work in a hospital so I'm never around any quiet until it's night time. And honestly, I've been too wound up to be able to relax at night. 
 

 I don't watch TV out of fear of something setting me off and triggering it even more. I'm even struggling with Reddit. 
 

 The other day I was so overwhelmed that I ended up going for a walk and the anxiety made me dry heave several times. 
 

 I just need hope that it will get better and that I can be fixed........
 

 Update: I had a teledoc apt and we are going to taper off the Zoloft and try Cymbalta. She gave me something to help bridge the tapering that is non-habit forming as well that I can take up to 3 times a day. At this point with how miserable I am, I don't have anything to lose......"

"Does anyone else have their anxiety show up in their muscles?
 

 I’ve dealt with anxiety for years and some days it feels like my muscles have been wound up all tight. I find myself clenching my muscles and needing to stretch them constantly due to this.
 

 This is relatively new for me but after some consideration today, I think it is anxiety. Some people just start to have panic attacks and don’t know why… I’m sure it could be the same for unconscious clenching or general stress.
 

 Thanks"
"Bit of context - I've (31M) been struggling with SA for as long as I know. I'd maybe describe it as mild anxiety, I have a job, socialise a bit and have a small circle of friends. Almost all social interactions cause me at least some anxiety and I find socialising or the dreaded lead up to a social event exhausting. I experience the most anxiety during social events with people I know (work, weddings, meeting with friends etc) and less stressful with complete randomers.
 

 I've tried some CBT therapy which mostly involved exposing myself to different (scary) social situations. This helped and definitely improved my symptoms but only temporarily, as soon as I stopped the symptoms were back exactly the same as before.
 

 I'd like to hear other people's therapy stories and welcome any suggestions. Has mediation helped anybody?"
"My partner (34M) and I (32F) have been together for about a year and a half. For many years prior to this current relationship, I had feelings for a gay male friend of mine. This gay friend also kept his sexuality and relationship with another guy in our friend group secret for years. Even after he came out and started dating his partner, I still had feelings for him. I was super confused by my romantic feelings for this gay man and also felt quite embarrassed by them which I why I kept them suppressed and to myself for a long time. After years of having feelings for this guy who would never love me back. I finally decided to start dating around, and after a few flings, I found my now boyfriend. 
 

 The thing is, my boyfriend is very sweet and loving, but I constantly over analyze and worry that my boyfriend is also gay. I’m constantly criticizing the way he interacts with other guys, what shows he watches, what kind of music he likes, what hobbies he has, what kind of jokes he finds funny, how his voice sounds, if my friends think he’s gay, etc. I’m always comparing him to my gay friend I had feelings for. I’m also always thinking my boyfriend is having secret relationships with other men.
 

 I’m worried these compulsive thoughts will never go away. I know this is a really unique scenario, but just wondering if anyone else has had compulsive thoughts about questioning their partner’s sexuality and how you coped with it. My boyfriend is very fun, sweet, kind, and just a lovely person who values the same things I do and shows me a lot of love, but I am crippled by these constant need to know if he’s gay or talking to other men and will ultimately leave me abandoned and embarrassed and heartbroken again."
"When I (M31) was younger, I was never the fighting type. I was a fairly quiet kid, my parents raised me in a protective environment and I lived in a safe area. I never got into fights, I did not need to. The older I got, of course a fight had to come. But when it loomed, I got so scared that at first I ran away. Eventually I did fight once, and ended up literally shitting my pants.
 

 For the life of me I could not understand why I was this way. It bothered me that other guys seemed to be super into fighting, were not (or way less) scared and seemed to have confidence and agression. I had non of those things, so I feared those fight-types with my life.
 

 This period of my life has left deep wounds. I felt like a pussy, I felt powerless to resist and that fear remains to this day. Feeling like even if a confrontation would happen, I'd either freeze or shit myself (and get shamed) is a horrible feeling. I just want to be a tough guy that can stand up for himself in a fight without freezing.
 

 Now I know that this is a matter of conditioning. I have been boxing for some years, became quite assertive and slowly learn to realise that it is just a matter of experience. Of desensitizing myself to all these situations. The emotional wound of feeling like a pussy needs to heal, because freezing when I had to defend myself was a horrible feeling and I have trouble not blaming myself. It gives me a lot of anxiety for the future.
 

 Anyway, I just needed to write this off me. Are there people here who recognize this and have gone through similar feelings?"
"To give some background info, I am a 31 year old woman who has never been in a relationship or had sex. It is a major insecurity of mine. I have been dealing with anxiety and OCD my entire life, but finally got the courage to start seeing a therapist earlier this year. It's something I wish I had done sooner, but I am proud of myself for finally addressing the issues that have been plaguing me for so many years. I graduated college back in 2013 and have a really great job where I am respected and appreciated. I live on my own and am saving up to buy a condo or house in the next year or so. Career wise I'm doing really well, but the relationship thing is one issue I'm having trouble overcoming.
 

 Several years ago I dated an old friend for a brief period after reconnecting. It didn't amount to anything because he had been hiding the fact that he was already in a committed relationship. This was someone I met in college and was good friends with, but was also told to be wary of, relationship wise. I wish I had listened. He has tried to contact me several times since, but I have blocked him. This was the only person I've ever dated, and as you can see, it wasn't a great experience. I have not attempted to date since then due to a combination of anxiety and an awful health issue I'm currently dealing with (hair loss) that has really hurt my self-confidence. I am working with my therapist to manage my anxiety and better my self-esteem, and she has encouraged me to set up a dating app.
 

 Now that we are heading out of the pandemic stage (finally), I really want to start dating. From my research, it seems like Hinge, Bumble or OK Cupid might be the best since I'm looking for a serious relationship and not just casual hookups. I am worried that my lack of experience will make it difficult for me to find a guy who will accept me for who I am, though I wouldn't want someone who would judge me for it anyways. I realize that online dating is probably the best avenue for me to meet someone, so does anyone have any advice for me? How would you approach this if you are just starting to online date? Obviously I'm not going to make my inexperience public information on my profile, so if you've been in a similar situation, how did you approach this?
 

 TL;DR: 31F never dated before due to anxiety related issues. Want to start but unsure where to begin with dating apps. Any advice?"
"Long time anxiety sufferer here. Would have minor anxiety attacks during my younger years (2-4th grade), then full blown panic attacks nearing age 5. I’ve been through a lot with my anxiety… but in the past 2 years, it’s changed. All of my anxiety seems to go to my muscles. I feel tight a lot of the time. I feel a need to stretch a lot. My muscles feel all wound up.
 

 Has anyone else had new symptoms come up with their anxiety? I know everyone handles stress differently but I find it odd that I rarely have panic attacks now, but my muscles feel like garbage.
 

 Thanks"
"I live in Poland. Don't know if it's relevant where I live.
 

 How do you deal with the fact that the prices are constantly rising? Me and my husband to be are going to buy a flat after our wedding in few months. Now we are renting. He takes it easy but I cannot stop thinking about rising prices. It's madness. We have small savings for maybe 1/4 the total price but the rest we need to cover with mortgage loan. From month to month we have less and less credit capacity. And from month to month the flat prices are higher. Our parents cannot help us, we are completely alone with that. If a bank gives us a loan, we will repay it most probably for 30 years.
 

 If we don't have a flat of our own - we cannot decide to have a baby. Maybe it's stupid but I don't think it is responsible to have a baby when you don't have a stable place for a living. But I'm 31 now, I cannot wait many years.
 

 I know it's probably just live and I cannot control the market situation but I'm completely overwhelmed by that. I can't sleep at night and makes me cry all the time."
I'm 31 year old guy most of my friends got married. I have anxiety disorder since 29. Since then I have Erectile dysfunction. My parents are forcing me to find a girl or else my parents will find a girl for me. If anyone is married can you give me advice how do guys manage. I need help.
"I'm 32 and I have experienced deja vu consistently throughout my life, if I had to guess it's a monthly occurrence, exactly how many do I experience, I cannot say as I haven't paid much attention to it before. 1-5 a month would be accurate I suppose.
 

 I have BAD health anxiety, in particular fear of cancer and since last fall my fears have been in overdrive and I have had several checks for different types and have a colonoscopy coming up in a few months too, just to go along with the bronchoscopy I had before because I was convinced I have lung cancer.
 

 Sometime mid April I read that brain cancer can cause frequent deja vu and about 10 days after that I had a deja vu while at the doctors office. Another one occurred maybe 5 days later. Since then I have been obsessed with these and now I'm sure I have several deja vus EVERYDAY, more often than not it's me reading something and then thinking ""was that a deja vu?"".
 

 Most of them are in line with me being unsure if they were one and sometimes I feel like that was definitely one.
 

 It would be a coincidence and a half to start experiencing frequent deja vu couple weeks after reading about it being a symptom of something serious and it being a specific illness that now manifested itself, so I concluded that it can be also my anxiety and OCD causing this, has anyone else experienced this or heard of this happening?"
"I currently live states away from my family (my choice) and am in a 2 year relationship. We love each other a lot. I’ve been living far, far away from my family for 10 years now, and I’m starting to realize how much I miss them.
 

 I constantly wonder where I will end up. Truthfully, I’m not a huge fan of where I currently live. It’s a major city with tons of people my age and tons of opportunities. But it was never really where I saw myself forever. 
 

 The problem is I don’t even know where I see myself. I want to live closer to my family deep inside, but I also do not love where I’m from. It’s cold, gets snow, and the people aren’t the friendliest in the US…. Lol. 
 

 I’m in this odd place. I know a move isn’t in the near future at all, but with my GAD I constantly think about 5,10,15 years into the future and where I will be, if my boyfriend will even want to move, etc. 
 

 Does any one have tips or just stories of overcoming this? I find that I am really missing out on the present moment and at least trying to make my current situation work for me."
"Hello, 
 After becoming treatment resistant to most other benzos, my psychiatrist prescribed me Librium. It’s working better than everything I’ve had so far, but it’s making me pretty sleepy and I’ve been sleepwalking. Did it work well for anyone else? How long does it usually last between doses? Will the sleepwalking go away? I have sleepwalking issues as it is but it’s gotten worse since I started the medication. Thanks I’m advance!"
"Has anyone else experience this too? Including intrusive thoughts and images and sometimes even conversations in your head that don't make any sense (they feel like fragments of other conversations that I had with someone during that day).
 If for example I'm super focused at work on something (especially when it gets frustrating) and decide to log off after closing hours, it's like my brain doesn't shut off. If I had a bunch of meetings that day, when I lay in bed at night I start having these nonsensical conversations. Sometimes they pop up even at random even when I'm not about to fall asleep.
 It's worrying me and it feels like I'm losing my mind..."
"Hi All, Im looking for advice or maybe a voice of reason.
 

 Since the start of the pandemic in 2020 I've been suffering with panic attacks and anxiety. My anxiety and panic attacks only happen when I'm around a lot of people or in an enclosed environment, I work from home and I'm an introvert so this doesnt happen often but when it does its really scary. 
 

 This week I talked to a doctor about taking something that would help. I was adament I did not want to take something everyday because I had terrible side affects with Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq) when I took it for two years and after I went off it I felt more like myself, being on it made me feel numb. I was alot happier for the years I was off it then when I was taking it. I'm 34 years old and I understand that my mental health is something that Im always going to suffer with but I just need to keep it in check, I go to therapy, meditate and do my best to be mindful of my mental health.
 

 I was hoping she would prescribe me something as a safety net rather than something that I have to take everyday thats going to rewire my brain (again). She prescribed me Escitalopram (Lexapro) and refused to give me anything else. I've just looked up the side affects and they sound horrendous - weight gain, inability to orgasm, stomach aches, headaches and drowsiness - basically the complete oposite of what Im trying to achieve. Am I being unreasonable for not wanting to try it? Should I seek out a new doctor or am I just being stubborn? Any advice from anyone in a similiar situation would be great."
"Since it's Friday I thought we could have a conversation about the different ways anxiety manifests to you all. 
 

 

 Mine usually builds up a bit gradually, I kinda get a couple of hints before I experience a full blown episode. Sweating, burning sensations, cold hands, racing heart, muscle spasms and derealization (which I hate the most). Though I'm not sure if some of them are a side effect of the medication I'm taking (Paroxetine) or if it's my vanilla anxiety.  
 

 

 How about you guys?"
"This is a bit weird, although it happens more than less every night, but I found that usually when I have a rough day and my anxiety is all over the place; at night it gets better, like feeling a sense of calmness. I go to bed around 1-2 AM. My anxiety starts to calm down around \~11PM.  
 Does anyone else experience this as well?"
"At July 2021 I noticed my Erectile dysfunction. At August I had seizure. Since my seizure I have dizziness and panic attacks. But at March 2022 my erection is improving. But my anxiety is not going. Does it mean that my anxiety will improve over time?
 

 Since February I started meditation and jogging maybe that's why my erection is improving. I'm happy I'm getting erection now I want my anxiety to go."

"Big dilemma here. 
 

 

 I've been prescribed Paroxetine for 4months now and tried (guided by my doctor) to up it from 10mg to 20mg. The issue is that everytime I upped the dose I started to feel worse. Jittery and shaky, muscles all tensed and weird burning sensations (same with 10mg but not that intense). 
 

 Don't get me wrong, I think Paroxetine helped, and is still helping, but I'm not sure if this could be mild serotonin syndrome or not, kind of terrified of the idea because I've heard that it's quite serious.
 

 A bit concerned because for my sleep, my doctor prescribed me Trazodone, to switch from my current night medication (Zopiclone) - I wonder if that would affect or even amplify those sensations.
 

 Anyone knows anything from experience or can shed more light into this as if it could be SS or not?"
"I have severe anxiety around working, jobs, and so on. I think a bad experience started it and since I already have depression and anxiety, I am on medication but it does not help in this case. My family doctor doesn't care and won't refer me to a psychiatrist because the wait list is 2-3 years long. I can't get a new family doctor either as none are available and most therapy options are expensive or based on short term goals instead of extended treatment. 
 

 It's frustrating because I don't feel well enough to work a stressful, 40+ hour a week job but I am not ill enough to get any kind of aid. I am 32 and live at home with parents that expect me to get a high paying, full time job AND take care of the house like they did when I was a kid, because if they could do it than I should too. Meanwhile, I have a casual job that gives me massive anxiety just to think about working too many hours. Then, when I do get hours, my parents always suggest I apply for jobs in the organization that are full time. They don't just support me getting through the few hours I get when my anxiety gets to me. It's always about doing more and more. 
 

 The organization hasn't always treated me well either, despite decent pay, but my parents don't understand why that contributes to my anxiety. 
 

 I can't move out even while working because rent here is absolutely crazy. So is food and utilities recently shot up too. Basically society wants me to work to the point I am physically ill and want to do nothing but cry, just for scraps to live on. All without any kind of help.
 

 I hate my life."
"I'm having parent-related anxiety about traveling, and sorry this is long-winded for backstory. Just need to vent maybe? Or see if I'm the only person in the world with this problem which feels a little unique given that I'm 30 years old...but I can't sleep because of a trip next week.
 

 I don't have any anxiety disorder - my anxiety isn't frequent and always has a reason, but my parents give me pretty severe anxiety. My dad has always been a pretty anxious person regarding me and my sister, which I only realized in recent adult years, and he's extremely traditional - East European, grew up abroad in poverty and came to the U.S. as a child and grew his life and his family, so he doesn't listen very much and he has all kinds of boomer-thoughts on society even though he is pretty progressive in some areas...areas that directly affect him and his life where he has experience/proof that they're real problems. He's always quick to blurt his strong opinions when you're in the middle of talking, and he'll go on and on for 20 minutes or even hours just arguing about political points and all kinds of things that aren't even relevant to my story, and somehow these arguments turn into yelling and screaming and fighting, and he always gets mad at me for being ""hard to talk to"" or contrarian or whatever apparently. He yells at me for things, and openly and admittedly treats me like a child and always will, and he's proud of that and he thinks it's right and he says he will never stop because he loves me so much, yada yada dad things. At this point in my life I just try to not really tell my parents anything, nod and agree at stuff, but it's extremely difficult because they get mad at me if they sense that I'm doing that, too. My dad and I got along great my whole young life, then once I got older and started disagreeing with him on things (even when I do it - I think - politely nd respectfully and how therapists recommend) and it got much worse. My dad doesn't believe that parents should have to ""respect"" their children other than super basic things like don't beat them up and don't starve them.
 

 Also, and this is HIGHLY important and relevant - My younger sister is a drug addict for the past 10+ years, and regularly has health problems, in the hospital...so his general anxiety is very real and justified. No matter what I do, it's never enough - he feels his opportunity to ""raise"" my sister was stolen from him (even though she was out of high school/adult by the time she started going to jail and prison). She's usually homeless nowadays, and my parents get calls in the middle of the night from her and hospitals frequently, or randomly every so often. So, the overload from their stress from her is that i never visit my parents enough, I didn't spend enough time with my mom on mother's day, the flowers I got her weren't big enough, I don't call my parents enough...I never talk to them...which is ultra-frustrating bc I do visit them for every major holiday (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter) and a few minor holidays ever year (like some but not all of the weekends of memorial day, labor day, 4th july, new years...whatever), plus I always visit on their birthdays and mothers day and father's day. I've never missed any holiday, birthday, or father/smothers day ever. Plus they have all these ""rules"" about how and when I visit - I live 2 hours away which for them is ""really far,"" so their request from me is that I only visit if I'm going to stay the night (never drive at night), which I've always done, and plan it ahead of time, so on. I always get anxious before visiting them, and usually while I'm there too because we always end up in long-winded fights sometimes to the point of tears of frustration on my part (and then its ""well you don't need to be emotional about it, it's JUST a conversation! Why can't you have a normal conversation????) meanwhile I never get to the point of even saying what I was gonna say, because we're off on tangents and whataboutisms and exaggerations and ethics and random things by then.
 

 My parents were always wonderful growing up in terms of providing plenty of love...sometimes too much to the point of overbearingness, and support. They were definitely overprotective, but not as much as some parents bc I did have freedoms. So I hate to feel resentment toward them but, I just can't take it. Pretty sure I have ADHD too, which they vehemently denied when I brought up the topic to them 10-years ago, complaining about millennials and how we all ""want"" to be diagnosed with something. Nowadays I am medicated for it (but not diagnosed), and I just keep it a secret from them. A lot of our issues over the years have also been how I don't answer my phone quickly enough (even within like 20 minutes which was unacceptable for years...until recently they insist that never happened; they never said that 20 minutes is unreasonable).
 

 Whenever I travel, I don't tell them about it - maybe I will in my last day or 2 so that they're only freaked out for a day rather than a week. I'm always anxious before a trip making sure they don't find out. This brings me to today.
 

 Here's my current problem...I have a trip planned to Mexico for a wedding from my best friend in the world who helped me through severe depression years ago, helped me find God...he and I shared a very deep love and connection for years through our roughest times, even though we spent most of our lives apart because he lives in Southern Mexico and I live in northern USA (we met in college).
 

 My dad always (unintentionally) stopped me from traveling - from his strong cultural standpoints on ""family"" staying close by, and his lack of ever discussing travel with me or prepping me for it, and getting mad at me whenever I wanted to travel to an unsafe country...like most of Europe (granted, during a time where there were bomb threats). He always told me horror stories like the movie Taken - all dads' favorite movie it seems, I think bc he thinks it'll keep me safe always checking my car before I get in it and stuff like that. So I never traveled and didn't know how to, despite it was my dream in younger years. One of our absolute BIGGEST fights ever was many years ago when I mentioned the possibility of visiting my friend in Mexico because it's so dangerous there. Dad actually walked out of the room and stopped talking to me for awhile that day, for like the first time ever, and Mexico is his go-to example of stupid Americans who travel abroad and get killed because they're so stupid and careless and ""idiots.""
 

 So, I'm an idiot and im fine with that - and I'm going to MX with my boyfriend for my best friend's wedding soon, and I'm having severe anxiety. The thing is that I'm fully aware I might get killed by cartels or trafficked...but I'm not even worried about that like I am about dad finding out.
 

 Finally - story is climaxing here - it's actually very often that something very bad happens with my sister or my mom's health at the worst times...my sister was once in the ICU and almost died to the point that family drove in from everywhere to say their goodbyes, and on a totally separate occasion my mom had an emergency (cancer) and I always seem to get these phones calls late at night when I'm in the middle of camping and no access to anything, my phone was on silent so I missed the calls all night, etc. And now my flight to MX is next week, and of course my sister just ended up in the hospital again today right on schedule.
 

 It feels like it'll be super hard hiding my trip from my parents, but there is NO WAY they can know. My dad will 100% have an immediate heart attack - guaranteed in every way with no delay - the moment he finds out, if he ever does. I'm afraid my cell phone won't work (not sure how my plan is with international travel) and that for the 4 days I'm there I'll miss all calls and texts. I'm afraid something bad will happen...and honestly truly, I'm not a fan myself of visiting MX either. I do agree it's not the safest, esp given that I'll be way down south in the country - not even at Cancun or something. This isn't exactly my first time traveling (I went to Puerto Rico, Seattle, and NYC recently) but only this year for the first time ever, and never internationally except Toronto. But because my boyfriend will be with me I feel like 75% better - he's traveled a lot more than I have, and my real concern is that something bad will happen to my sister while I'm gone - not to me.
 

 My friend is picking us up from the airport, he arranged our lodging and paid for it, and he's going to be with us a lot of the time if not most/all before the wedding. But now I can't sleep because I just ""know"" that something terrible will happen to sister (or mom, or dad)...maybe my sister will die and I won't get the call for a whole week, and then my parents will think I'm dead too because I'm not answering. I know it sounds like overthinking but I swear to god this stuff happens all the GD time. I might just tell them that I'll be in Canada, and lie like my phone is having problems so tell them to contact my BF if an emergency. But then they'll ask me to send pictures of my travels and tell them all about my trip, and then long-term lying about the details, like why everyone in Canada looks Mexican...? gives me more anxiety. Or, I could lie and just say I'm going to my Mexican friend's wedding in Florida...so then when something bad happens they won't be surprised why I'm not around right away, yet they'll feel ok cuz I'm at least safe in FL. But then if my parents call me at any point, they'll know by my phone's ringtone that I'm international right?
 

 I can't sleep, and that's fine, I guess I'm just gonna get through it. Thanks for listening. Is this situation weird AF? I feel like it's super weird and unique but maybe super common potentially at the same time?"

"Hi there, i am 30 and I have a fear of doctors that stems from my sons birth/traumatic event. I am afraid more of the vital part (bp and heart rate measurments) because they go through the roof when there.. Its more the fear of THEIR reactions that terrify me. I need to go to a cardio to get a few things okayed and I know I will feel so much better after but I can't get myself to go. any tips?"
"I (31F) have been struggling with driving anxiety as long as I've been driving. After getting into a few accidents, my anxiety got considerably worse. Up untill recently I felt tense driving anywhere, even on familiar routes. Then I started seeing a therapist who does EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing), and we did a few sessions around my driving anxiety (specifically focusing on the accidents I've been in). I feel much calmer while driving since doing EMDR. I still have more work to do, but I've already seen a great improvement in my driving anxiety. 
 

 If you are struggling with driving anxiety, consider trying EMDR. It's helped me tremendously, and I think it could help other people. I just wanted to share my experience. Hopefully someone finds it helpful. My heart goes out to everyone struggling with driving anxiety. It really makes life hard. I hope you all find a solution that works for you."
"Yeah so the title says it all. I need to vent. It was rough as hell. Happened a couple of days ago. I will never being doing that again lol. I’ve never participated in a wedding before, knew only about 10 people there, most from work. The other 100 or so I didn’t. I was also in my buddies wedding as a groomsmen. And that wasn’t too bad if I’m being honest. However it’s what happens after the ceremony that about sent me into a panic attack.  
 

 First off, no one told me the groomsmen were gonna have all eyes on them for a decent part of the beginning of the reception. 
 

 They introduced us and we had to do a silly competition with the brides maids of who’s entrance was the best Aka forced dancing for everyone’s amusement. I didn’t really know the other groomsmen at all so they went all in and started acting crazy. It was actually pretty hilarious from the audiences perspective however I just kind of awkwardly stood there like a dumbass. Incredibly embarrassing moment for me. Like I wanted to join in but I completely froze up. I was 100% the odd one out. Videos were taken. 
 

 The night before, My friends wife told me she wanted me to write a speech for him, to make sure he felt significant and so that some one would do one because his family is pretty garbage and not many showed up. So I was very straight forward and told her no lol. 
 

 Public speaking has always been my greatest fear in life. Not dying but talking to a group of people. Seems like an incredibly silly thing. But then I felt pressured into it and I didn’t want to let him down because I respect the man. Anyway I agreed to it. I have decent writing skills imo and I showed it off to a few people and they liked it. So I was like great this is going to be fine. 
 

 The problem started when they right off the bat did toasts. Now my friends wife didn’t know the coordinator was gonna force speeches on their people of honor. (And told me later had she known she wouldn’t have made me do it.) So now he was covered in the feeling special department. (Also she promised me shots before hand lol that didn’t happen, l Was completely sober.) They absolutely killed it though, with their speeches made up on the spot. But they were about both my friend and his wife. 
 

 My speech was only about him and basically how proud of him I was. So it came off awkward, because it was direct towards him. I did what she asked. I wasn’t his best man. When it came to me actually doing it I was like nope I’m good , but the bride was like oh “xwesside x” wrote a speech last night though . So the coordinator hands me the mic as I’m desperately telling her that I was fine with not doing it. Meanwhile there’s still 100 people staring at me, watching me die inside lol. Anyways I was like screw it he’s my friend and I told her I’d do it for him. Because that’s the kind of person I am. I tried to push through. 
 

 So it starts off fine, however that’s when time stopped about 5 sentences in. My jokes fell flat, I thought they were solid lol. My hands started visibly shaking uncontrollably and my voice got weird . My Speech felt like it was way too long. I was definitely being recorded. My brain started freezing up and I started that whole overthinking thing which in return made my ability to read what I wrote incredibly hard. I just awkwardly stared at my phone. I Didn’t look up once. 
 

 So after that mess. I sat down and just slammed that champagne lol. My entire body was shaking for an hour after. I couldn’t control it. I was the last one to do a speech. Only 4 people total. They all made it up on the spot. The amount of unnecessary shame I felt was crippling. 
 

 So after that people were coming up to me left and right telling me it was a good speech, but I think we all know people only do that to be nice when they feel bad for you. I know it was bad, they knew it was bad so they had to console me in some manner. I was an embarrassed child at that point. What’s worse though is that I’m bad at taking compliments so I found myself explaining that I actually didn’t want to do it and i probably sounded like a terrible friend with my explanations lol it was so embarrassing in hindsight. 
 

 I basically have the social skills of an awkward tween. I have no idea how to make small talk with folks or mingle. So kinda just drank myself into oblivion and walked around awkwardly. Didn’t help I wanted to just chill by my friend, the groom. So I kept just gravitating to where he was all night. And I felt like a needy puppy. It was just so rough. Everyone was having the time of their lives dancing and acting a fool. And I was just chillin by myself all night essentially. 
 

 If anyone has advice to make yourself stop thinking about this type of thing I’m all ears. I give myself secondhand embarrassment just thinking about it. And my brain won’t stop thinking about it. Like I know it’s over and most people probably won’t remember. But it was definitely recorded 😂 and someone on fbs gonna post that. Guaranteed. Dunno if I could handle that. Tryin real hard to just laugh it off but ya know. It’s difficult. Pls help lol."
"A little background: I've had anxiety since I was a kid (31f) and I just gave birth to my first son via C-section. I had been off my medication at the end of the pregnancy, and I was doing great until the stress of the hospital (I don't like hospitals, beeping machines and constantly worrying something is wrong when things beep). I gave birth last month and I've had the worst anxiety for the longest period of time straight. 
 

 I have had more panic attacks in this last month than I have ever had in such a short period. I've had a lot of weird symptoms from postpartum recovery, so those were making me anxious as I'm kind of a hypochondriac. That being said, thankfully most of them have subsided, but the chest pain I feel makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack.
 

 I have pain in the middle of my chest between my two breasts. It's an achy pain that I've had since yesterday, but I've had overall chest pain since the hospital. I've had an EKG which came back perfect. Are other people having achy pains where their heart is from anxiety? How did you get rid of it? Deep breathing doesn't help."
"I (34m) have struggled with anxiety for years, particularly when it involves my job, regardless of where I’m working at the time. I’ve gotten therapy for this but am between therapists at the moment. 
 

 I’ve never had a full panic attack in my life and feel lucky in that way. However, things at work and in my life in general have been fairly chaotic the past couple weeks without signs of letting up quite yet and I’ve noticed at points throughout the day I feel like I need to inhale a large amount of air for some reason (I even open my mouth wider to do so) like I haven’t been breathing well enough or something (I’m not actually noticing having any issues breathing during the day though).
 

 I was wondering if needing to do that might have anything to do with how panic attacks start, anxiety, etc.?"
"What the title says I guess. I’m 30F and I’ve always struggled with anxiety, as I’m sure everyone else has. However in the past few years I’ve noticed when I’m put into a situation I need to talk, even as simple as telling a customer “hello, how can I help you?” at work it feels like I’m so anxious my brain fights with every fiber to cut the connection to my voice and strangled noises just come out. I will also stutter like crazy if put on the spot or have to speak in a group setting. I’ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar 2, ptsd, and social anxiety so I’ve been trying to use healthy coping skills or mindsets but sometimes I just feel like due to my anxiety the communication from my brain to my voice box emergency shuts off and it’s really starting to affect my social life and work life. I know no one here is a doctor but does anyone else get like this or know someone who does? What are your coping skills? I feel like this sub is the only place I can be open about how daily a struggle this is for me and how badly I want help."
"I'm 30 years olds and I had my first panick attack like 3 years ago. 
 

 My theory on why I've started having these panick attacks related to my health, is because when I was in Vietnam like 4 years ago I got really sick, and I didn't want to go to the doctor at first (I thought it was just a fever) but after 5 days when I felt really really weak and I got really scared for my life, I did and it turned out it was the Dengue fever. Few days of taking some medicine and I was fine.
 

 

 My theory is since then, my brain got a software update and is always body scanning me to find symptom and alert me with (a lot of) anxiety so I don't fcked up again by waiting too long.
 

 

 What about you guys, any similar experiences of past trauma event?"
"I'm a 32F with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but only recently has it started to affect my sleep. The last week I've had insomnia, with only a couple nights of 7-9 hours. Even those nights I took some OTC sleep meds to help, and I slept in a lot those nights, which may have affected my rhythm.
 

 On Sunday, I bought some CBD oil that was supposed to help with relaxing, but the last two nights for sleep have been some of the worst I've ever had. I know it's not a cure all and does not put me to sleep itself. And that ultimately it's up to me to control my anxiety to get back on track since my mind just keeps racing and racing when I try to go to sleep. But I thought CBD oil would help with that, since getting drowsy was not the issue. I took 25 mg (the lowest dose recommended) since I didn't want to overdue it. I'm not new to CBD due to casual THC use but have never been a heavy user. So not sure if I just haven't taken too much.
 

 Anyone else have any experience with CBD oil? If it helps if anyone can give advice on dosage, I'm 5'3 and 135 pounds and like I said, I usually consume THC in small dosages so don't have a super high tolerance.
 

 I'm really hoping to get back on track with my sleep and feel terrible/ not myself. I'm doing CBT therapy, trying sleep hygiene, and have OTC sleep meds for emergencies. I'm afraid I might have to go to a doctor to get back on anti-depressants or benzos for emergencies, or get prescribed something stronger. (I was taking Cymbalta for 5 years from 2013-2018, which worked and like I said, did not have this longer-term insomnia before at all).
 

 Any advice re CBD oil or anything else?"
"Hi y'all
 

 I've suffered from generalised anxiety and social anxiety since around 17, and I'm 34 now.
 

 Historically, my anxiety has been about how people think of me (social), and about not living up to my potential.
 

 It's been a few years of deep inner work, and I'm finally feeling free of those anxieties. Undoing my childhood conditioning, as well as getting to a much more manageable age with my children, being able to establish healthy habits, and having the confidence to succeed in a career, mean that my life feels literally perfect. In a very realistic way. I am legitimately happy with my life in the current moment, and I can see nothing but a positive future for my family and I, even with reasonable normal life issues.
 

 So of course, my anxiety is now manifesting as terror of something going wrong.
 

 I am scared my marriage will fall apart. I'm scared some sort of disaster will happen and my kids will die or I will get cancer or something. I'm scared of the shadowy plethora of unknown horrible things that could happen that could destroy our lives and put me back in a position where I have zero confidence to enjoy my life. I think about how blessed I am to have the perfect marriage, perfect kids, perfect career, perfect work life balance, and I see my friends who struggle every day and feel like the enjoyment of my life is arrogant and undeserved and destined to be short lived - no one can be happy forever right? I am not allowed to have an easy and fulfilling life.
 

 How do I resolve this in myself? How do I embrace the uncertainty, be open to life and enjoy this life?"
"For the past few months i've been obssesed about my visible pulses in my neck, chest and just below my clavicle, just below the spot where the shoulder and clavicle meet. Hard to explain.  
 I've been doing OK lately but now i'm back to obsessing and checking the mirror to look for the pulsations. Found it very noticable today, especially the clavicle ones and I can feel the fear creeping back. is it possible for a 33 year old to have fully active and advanced heart disease for months to the point where pulsing is visible.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Please does anyone else have visible pulsing?!"
"Had a full blown panic attack and managed to take my blood pressure right in the very peak moment. 
 

 156/10 and 153/9 with 171 bpm
 Is that dangerous or a lot during a panic attack?"
I have mild anxiety. The worst of my anxiety comes from dating and relationships. I'm 30 and I've been dating a girl for a few months and my anxiety is the worst it's ever been and I've been having serious sleep issues. My doctor prescribed Buspar but I'm really hesitant. I know enough people on anxiety meds and I'm not sure I want to go down this road. My intention is not to be on it forever but I'm worried that once I open this can of worms I won't be able to get off it or it will make me worse and I will end up taking meds forever. Any advice is appreciated.
"This is a vent/cry for help. Anxiety is through the roof and angst is almost unbearable. I can't even sleep.
 

 I've been single for so long, I barely tried to escape it. But every time I try, I get shut down abruptly. Like a punch to the face and to the stomach, every time.
 

 Nevertheless I am socially active, have friends, do a ton of different activities with them, also I get in touch with several people with social activities, etc. Still no luck.
 

 Last time, this girl just appears out of nowhere into my life. She is looks-wise my kind of girl, I just fell for her from the 1st time I saw her. I guess all this years of being alone and being starved for emotional and romantic connection are taking a huge toll on me also. 
 

 Anyways, this girl just joined my friend group recently (I've been with this group for more than 6 years) and I see her regularly. She went through a hard breakup and a friend we have in common introduced her to our group. Months have passed already. So she is emotionally available now.
 

 This made me gather high hopes. Thinking things like, maybe this is my time. Maybe after all these years I will have some luck, and a cute, smart and well adjusted girl is coming into my life. (I am 32 and 6 years older than her). Boy I was wrong, she looks through me like I am a ghost. She didn't even considered me as a potential partner even when I just daydreamed about her for so long. Hell, if I don't even try to get close to her, talk to her, etc. she doesn't move a finger. I am completely invisible to her. I tried to get close a bit but, I do all the work. 0 reciprocity. Yet you have me there, daydreaming about her 24/7.
 

 She knows I am single and that I am a decent person. (I guess that doesn't cut it anyways). But what literally broke my heart to pieces, even I doubted I still had anything remaining, it's the fact that she prefers to download online dating apps and try there. Rather that than to even give that irl guy a chance. 
 

 This is making me so depressed. The other day we were with our friends at a dinner and I had spent almost all dinner trying to keep an anxiety attack at bay, because she mentioned she is seeing someone from those online dating apps. I am so demolished.
 

 This is just confirmation that I don't make the cut. I will end alone for the rest of my life but I can't seem to come to terms with the fact. Somehow always, a little spark of hope remains, and then brings me here, always. To this anguish and despair. To this pit, where my chest is literally aching. I am tired of getting confirmation that I am not good enough. I am really becoming really tired of being alone. Like really tired. And I'm scared, because even if I felt bad in the past. This time is even more intense. I think I don't want to keep living anymore. Not that I will actively end it, but I just want to disappear. I'm so tired."
"or do you just park far away?
 

 I parked 10 minutes from the shops today just to not block, now feeling like a massive anxious loser"
"I ride my bike to work every day. I live out of town and it's a 20 min ride, it's ok and helps to get rid of my anxiety before arriving.
 

 BUT rn my tire needs air (don't know how to say that in English). It's not flat but it needs it so it doesn't burst. 
 

 That means I have to go to riding the bike to the dude that does that cause I cannot do it myself cause *anxiety*. My brain can't stop thinking about that tire and having to go to work in that bike I don't have another option. 
 

 I feel like I'm going to die. I know I'm not but yes.
 

 Update: My tires are fine, was all in my head. Tought because i came at night and felt as they needed air. I'm going to learn how to do it myself though.
 

 Edit: ok so what if they're not fine and I don't know how to tell? How do you know if a tire is fine??"
"Does anyone have ed? Pleas I need help
 I'm suffering from anxiety disorder and panic attacks"
Sometimes I call 999 out of fear as sometimes I get really bad iambic attacks and helplines like 111 usually take long time to get through. I'm very pathetic I need to find a way to stop this cause I was told by my OT today that someone did this and the police showed up jailed them and took them to court I cant keave my house do this woukd be extremely stressful if to happen. I really need to find away of coping on my own with severe panic attacks just dint know how I know every technique in the book and they are useless during a panic attack. so tired of being mentally ill my life it's just wavering away.
"I (f33) have a full time job and need extra money. I have an elder friend who cleans houses and says she can use the extra hands if I'm available this Monday, Tuesday and Friday. 
 

 I have been budgeting and money is tight and the money I was going to get for these houses were going to go towards gas and an oil change. Last Friday I told her ""Just tell me the times and I'll be there"". Her reply was ""will do"".
 

 

 All weekend I've not heard from her and my boyfriend said to me if she hasn't told you what time to meet then she doesn't need your help. I'm autistic and some things slip past me so I asked him to confirm that's what this radio silence on her end really was. 
 

 

 Just to be sure, I messaged her this morning saying,"" because I've not gotten any time confirmation that means there's no houses, correct?""
 

 Still radio silence. 
 

 I'm next to paralyzed waiting on SOMETHING! Disappointed and worried now about how I'm going to get that extra $200 this week from those houses. 
 

 

 I ran my own cleaning business years ago and I ALWAYS communicated with my team and houses. Idk why that's not happening with my friend now. A simple text is all! In 72 hours, a simple ""8 a.m. or no houses"". 5 seconds to text and nothing. 
 

 

 I'm trying not to downplay my anxiety and feel it so I don't have an attack, but it's difficult for me to not suppress this because it's my ""go-to"" method of coping. 
 

 

 Just one simple text. Why is that difficult?! And it's rude and dismissive of MY time on my day off. I just...UUUGH!"
"Sorry if poorly formatted, on mobile and frantically typing this on break at work.
 

 Today, I(20m) took my drivers license test. My sister (32F) accompanied me through all my anxiety, as she has for a while, and while she knows I am an anxious person, she has her own doubts about the origin.
 

 Long story short, I failed, and started to get upset and yell why I was embarrassed and crying after she asked me. I told her I felt like a failure and she proceeded to yell at me telling me that none if it is this big of a deal because I can take it again, and other people won’t be disappointed in me, and no one is judging me and it’s in my head.
 

 And I know that. I know a lot of my anxiety regarding myself is built up a lot in my head. But any time i try to feel different about something or change my perspective, it feels like all I’m doing is lying to myself and trying to distract or cope. Which makes me feel even worse.
 

 How do I overcome this and try to feel better? She said maybe I should try therapy again but I don’t really know how to explain everything I feel to a therapist while also justifying the money spent and the fact that they could tell me the same stuff. But i’m sick of upsetting others by being upset and anxious and I’m sick of not being able to achieve something without being afraid to fail."
"Hi guys,
 

 Hope you are well! For starters, I (33m) have depression and anxiety and have been on 10mg Paxil for the last year with amazing results.

 Her father died during peak Covid times and her mental health was spiraling. I got her to see a psychiatrist who diagnosed her with Schizoaffective Disorder and Anxiety.
 

 She was originally on 2.5mg Olanzapine and Fluoxetine (forgot dosage).
 

 About 3 weeks ago, almost out of nowhere she started having extreme episodes of anxiety to the point where she’s having lower abdomen pains, restlessness and she fidgets/paces back and forth constantly for hours.
 

 The psychiatrist recently changed her fluoxetine to Paxil 10mg and even upped her Olanzapine to 7.5mg for a bit and she is still having really bad anxiety. She also prescribed Propranolol 10mg to help calm her down.
 

 It hurts me so much to see my mom this way and I know she’s suffering. The psychiatrist for the last 2 appointments has played with the dosing of her medications and tells her to check in the next week. She has constantly felt horrible and is urging me to take her to a new “Anxiety Specialist”
 

 What can I do to help her?
 

 Thank you everyone 🙏🏼"
"Hello. I'm a (M34) lead talent acquisition specialist and currently have 2 people under my supervision. I work with great clients and I earn the respect of my coworkers and my boss (Regional Project Manager). I've been working from home since March 2020 and haven't been able to have a normal life. Before that, I get out to go to my work and have meetups with friends and girlfriends, but since the pandemic, I barely got out of my house. I gain and lost weight. I got bad reflux and started to mess up with my breathing and had a lot of panic attacks. Also, I stopped eating properly.  It got really bad on Dec 2021 because of some sickness involving my mother and when we went to get her results (to see if she had cancer) I had a panic attack in the car. Since then, it's been very uncomfortable for me to travel long distances. My health is good in other aspects but mentally I can't concentrate on the important stuff. It's been messing with my productivity and this quarter barely made my goals. I've been on psychotherapy since January of 2022 and it involves some ""homework"" for me to do. Leave my phone away so I can sleep well, get up early, work out, etc. But I had an injury in early April and I haven't been able to go to the gym. I'm fully recovered now, but I'm still not going. I'm confined to my room and not getting out to do anything. For me it's only working, some video games, and sleep. No real interaction with anyone. Yesterday, my therapist told me that maybe I should go to see a psychiatrist but that pissed me off...I started to tell her that I will start doing the things I was doing but that made me think. Why I was so upset? Maybe I should go to get a diagnosis. What should I do? I don't feel bad, sad, or angry, but sometimes I have those feelings on unrelated occasions. Could you share your experience with those? Also, do you think that a remote consultation with a psychiatrist it's as effective a face-to-face one? Thank you in advance. (and sorry for the typos, English is my second language, I'm from Mexico)."

"TW: cancer, death, parent loss
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 My (33F) husband's (29M) father is dying of cancer. I do not particularly do well with death and I have a difficult time coping with it; however, my husband's parents don't particularly like me or even wanted him to marry me, from what I understand. I am feeling more upset that my husband is in distress than about his father's inevitable passing.
 

  I want to know, my anxious friends, how do you support your spouse through this without compromising your own mental health? I can put their dislike past me as I want to support my husband through this. I have not had to bury a parent yet, so I do not know exactly what he is going through. We are making the 3-hour drive today to be with him for his final moments. I am also anxious about seeing his father in this state, as it will probably make me extremely upset and I want to be able to hold it together. I prepared by arranging care for our son and reserving a hotel, which I think was a good way to support him. 
 

 I'm just not sure of what is to come and how to support my spouse through his grief. Thank you for reading."
"I’m 30m from the United Kingdom. 
 

 Basically I was walking along the street when the best way to describe it was a ‘bad boy racer’ drove past me and shouted out what seemed to be my name and quickly reversed back, 2 young men I did not recognise were in the car and started saying stuff to me but I couldn’t make out what they said. I said to them “I don’t even know who
 you are” and the driver shouted “where are you going” and then sped off extremely fast. 
 

 I struggle with anxiety and get anxious over things easily and the whole experience has left me feeling quite worried and paranoid. I took the reg plate and make of car down though, not sure if it will help at all. 
 

 Just looking for some help on the matter?"
"This was very strong especially in the beginning, where I didn't know that my symptoms were a result of high stress (and anxiety).
 

 I did tests for basically everything and everytime my mind would scan for even the smallest moment in the past where I slightly matched with the symptom indicated.  
 Eg. mania test question: ""did you ever felt very energetic to the point you didn't sleep or slept for 2-3 hours?"" and my brain be like ""ah yes when I was a kid I remeber that a few times I stayed up all night playing video games at sleepovers"" or other exagerations like that for other disorders.  
 The worst one were the personality disorders because the questions are very broad and everyone can kind of relate to them, the problem is the intensity.
 

 Wondering if anyone else was ever freaked out like I was."

"Hi. I've been having heart anxiety for a while now, doctors say I'm fine, listen to my heart and hear nothing bad. My cholesterol is also perfect and no constrictions heard in my arteries.  
 But I'm seeing my pulse everywhere! My neck, my clavicles, my chest and abdomen. I went to a doctor on Wednesday cause my BP monitor was picking up irregular heartbeat but the doctor found nothing wrong. 
 I'm also worrying about weight loss, now I have been planning on losing weight and have cut back on portion sizes and snacking and eating a bit healthier but the 4 or so kilos I've lost in the last few months make me worry that maybe there is something else more sinister going on. Anyone else get like that?"
"I walked by the bathroom and it smelled. I wondered what it was and saw a big turd in the bath sitting there. I didnt know my daughter pooped in the tub when I gave her a bath this morning because of bubbles and even rinsed her hair out with it. It solid so trying not to freak out. Has this happened to anyone?. Do I go and rebathe her? Im Freaking out just a little. She has been everywhere and now sleeping. I unfortunately became a germaphobe when covid hit. Could use help, support. Husband is no help."

"I am 30 and have suffered with extremely bad anxiety for at least 14 years. I have never told anyone about it and always tried my best to compose it. 
 It's been so bad that I've never had a paid job, never had a girlfriend and still live at home.
 

 I am so Pissed off about it I finally had enough so I called doctor's surgery the doctor prescribed propranolol 10 mg X2 daily, they did F all.
 I have dyspraxia and along with my anxiety means I can't express myself properly and I don't think he realises at all how bad my anxiety is. 
 

 Today the doctor did a new prescription for profonolol but increased the dosage to 40 mg X 3 daily
 

 Should these reduce my anxiety ? The 10 mg did absolutely nothing. 
 Google states profonolol does nothing to ease anxiety but only helps to hide physical affects of anxiety such as sweating and shaking, which is basically Bs.
 

 Please help, thanks"
"So angry with my current doctor /psychiatirst
 

 she prescribed me medicine which seems to have many side effects for me ( effexor) and withdrawal already scares me .( I have not even started yet) and she is refusing to switch me to other meds which will work better for me and have less side effects
 

 She listened to me for only 5 minutes a ( I have severe general anxiety ) .I had only 5 min.talk
 

 I called her last time she told me she was very busy with other patients 
 

 It sucks that I can't get appointment with other doctor anytime soon for several reasons :( I am angry and mad wasted my money ,time and ask strangers on internet about different meds because I have no trust in my doctor .
 

 Just needed to vent"

"This question is about me . I have severe anxiety and I know exactly what causes it ......
 

 Thankfully I do not have depression ( sure I get sad and low time after time like most people but I am not depressed ) 
 

 I was excited to try medications /antidepressants but I have read many horror stories about them so currently taking only light medications ,my doctor prescribed 
 

 I am concerned if i take antidepressant and I am not depressed now they may make my situation even worse ...
 

 (Life is hard for me because of anxiety but I am sure if my situation changes it will get better ...) so do people like me still need antidepressants ?"

"I am struggling. I apologize for the long post, but need some help. I thought I became a germaphobe from having my first child and then covid hitting shortly after. 2 years later, I still suffer from it and it's getting worse, especially being pregnant again. Finally talking more to people about it, they think it was created as a trauma response from my husband and wanting to clean him away. He has been emotionally and mentally abusive, a bully, a narcissist. I don't think I wanted to admit it, but I have had enough. I am scared though to be a single mom, especially with a newborn soon, but I can't live like this anymore. It's controlling and ruining my life. I never used to be like this. He doesn't support me. Dismisses my feeling and keeps saying he is frustrated with me, unhappy, nothing to be proud of me of, threatens divorce a lot, especially after finding out we were pregnant. I have begged for marriage counseling and he refuses because he believes our problems on my germaphobia and I am destroying the house. I asked why he won't, and he stated because he is not a bitch and don't need others to fix things for him, thst I should be able to just get over it, quit trying to have others fix my problems, and quit being so dependent. I am seeing a therapist for exposure therapy, but not going well. I plan on finally leaving, but want to make sure I am all set an completely ready when I do, but also make sure I can take my children back home to another state, because I have no family here. I will not leave them behind. His family sees and some have mentioned things, but no one will say anything to him and his mom says yes he is very stubborn, but it's just his frustration with my germaphobia, and kinda sweeps in under the rug. I am scared to do this on my own, but my children don't need to learn this is how you should be treated and learn to treat someone like this. Any help and suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you for reading."
"It's been more than 1 year of therapy with 2 different psychologists and we never discovered the possible root of the cause of the symptoms.
 

 There has never been any real traumatic thing in my childhood, relationships have always been at least fine, same with physical activity and all the other standard stuff.
 

 Anyone else has some tips for my situation?"

"Hi all , I have a pretty busy life (30F) going to school full time and also working full time. I don’t notice it much but people are always asking me if i’m in a rush because of how activated I look. My anxiety levels have increased this past year a lot. How do I take a step back?"

"There's so so much to our relationship that I cant type it all so I'll do my best to keep this short and simple. We have been together for over 4 years. We used to live together but she took an overdose in January so we decided it would be best for her to move back home with her mother whilst she recovered and went through therapy etc. She lives about 2 hours drive away, so I go to see her at weekends like I used to before we moved in together. I have suffered with terrible anxiety for years along with Retroactive Jealousy disorder and intrusive thoughts. I had got good at blocking out these things, but with her living away, I have slowly slipped back into it. I have recently started therapy for this, which has re opened a lot of my wounds so to speak. Anyone that has experienced this will know what I mean.
 

 The majority of my intrusive thoughts and anxieties are sexual, graphic mental movies or sexual thoughts of not being good enough or satisfying her, so she has to find someone else etc. She's never really been overly sexual and hasn't masturbated much before. I know I can make her finish through oral or using my hands/fingers etc, but when we have penetrative sex I finish quite fast, not prematurely but a few minutes I'd say, which can't be enjoyable for her even if she says it is. I should also say that due to the age difference she has had previous partners, whereas she was my first proper sexual partner. My biggest insecurities are all around sex. I have anxieties like, am I good enough? Does she enjoy it? When she closes her eyes, is she thinking of other people? Do I compare to her exes? So on and so forth.
 

 I was kinda dealing with that and getting on with it but recently she has got more sexual, which was good for me, even though I thought it had come out of nowhere. But then the other day I found some toys that she uses on her own and doesn't want us to use them together. Which obviously triggered my anxiety and insecurities massively, so I caved in and had to ask her. It was a calm conversation as we never raise our voice or argue aggressively. She told me that I do satisfy her but when it's on her own she is able to clear her mind, enjoy it and not worry about making me finish too. I asked if she thinks of other people or anything like that and she says no, but then my head tells me she would say that even if it wasn't the case. So I can't win. She says she just reads erotica, but then that also hits my insecurities as I don't masturbate or watch porn at all these days, as she is all I want. Would that not mean I am not enough if she has to use other things to stimulate her? I trust her completely and know she wouldn't be unfaithful but it plays on my mind. Asking for constant reassurance just makes things worse.
 

 As we don't live together we can't have a face to face conversation so it's all over text as we are both busy until we can call. She got annoyed and said she wanted some time to herself before she said something she regretted, which in my head would be her saying something that confirms my insecurities.What else could she regret saying? She also said she isn't happy analyzing her sex toys and having her personal moments twisted in a way that makes me feel bad as its not fair and not ok. Which I completely agree with but I cannot help it. I don't know how to believe her when she says things, even if it's what I want to hear, my head just tells me she is just saying it.
 

 So I would like some advice on what I should do. I am getting help for my intrusive thoughts and anxiety, but I feel that my insecurities are genuine and not a product I've made up in my mind. How do I accept it and stop bothering about it? How do I accept what she says as truth and just let her masturbate however she likes? I have so much bouncing around in my head and would appreciate others thoughts on the matter please"

"Tagged as venting as that feels the most appropriate tag
 

 Edit: There is a lot more I can say on this and my mind but thought it best to keep it short, sweet and somewhat coherent.
 

 Edit 2: I have messaged one of my oldest friends about meeting up, I have also told him that I could really do with talking to someone and he knows what my mind is like. He's read it but not replied so that's not helpful. I mean I'm not surprised because he always takes ages to reply, but if someone says to me they need to talk about something I drop everything to listen.
 

 I'm not sure if I should be open with friends that I'm currently dealing with anxiety and could do with meeting up soon. To provide some context: I currently live with family (thanks covid and cost of living) and work from home (occasionally helping family as well) and don't get out as much as I'd like to. I do have a small group of friends but lately I've been ignored when making attempts to meet up for lunch or something. I feel I should say something so people are aware that but at the same time, I don't want people to meet me because they feel they have to.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 I know I can talk online with people which does help with the isolation but I need that feeling of being in the same room as someone. I think I miss human contact really. Also, I need to be around people my own age because my family is lovely but very hard to talk to about things. I know I could join local groups but I'm not very good at things like that. I usually take a friend with me to help ease me in.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Hopefully that made sense and I didn't come across as an idiot"
"The irony of me posting on here is not lost upon me. I might be posting this in the wrong place, but I would consider it anxiety of some form.  
 

 

 I find it difficult to talk to people via social media. I find sending a simple tweet difficult, even if it's something I want to talk about. I do have friends on there but I think my main fear is being ignored. If I wanted to be ignored I'd talk to my parents. 
 

 I also feel that I am in a bit of a vicious cycle because of it, and the only way I can break it is just to say what's on my mind, but I don't think a lot of people want someone constantly screaming on their timeline."
"I think it would be tiring to describe everything that has happened in my life, but I just wanted to connect with someone who has depression and anxiety and is able to deal with it on a day to day basis because it has made me crippling. I can't think of working with something because I always have problems with crises and forgetfulness. I have depression and anxiety since I was 16 years old (but I believe since I was a child due to trauma at the time and genetic issues). I just want a light from someone because I have given up and I only think about taking my life. I'm 33 years old and I can't stand not living and being a burden to everyone."
My occupational therapist I trust but I'm embarrassed to show them my room as its disgusting tbh but she says it gives them a further picture on my mental Health never shown anyone My room before been hesitant for long time but since it may further help understanding my mh I'm willing to show.
"Hey guys, I need help and support. I lost my dad almost 2 years ago and I already had anxiety before that and now I feel like I’m drowning. It’s particularly bad when I wake up and I don’t know why but now I’m scared to go to sleep. Im on meds but I don’t think they’re working. I don’t know how to get through this. Every day is a battle. Can someone please please help?"
"I get really bad anxiety i even had a panick attack in the office but it not because of the pain or needles i get it from having my mouth open and having their hands jammed in my mouth its wierd , when i feel my saliva pooling in my throat i feel like i cant swallow then i start panicking"
"I've had driving anxiety for my entire life. Even being in the passengers seat can be startling for me. I'm 31 now and I think I'm ready to try driving again. My partner put something in perspective for me the other day that's really hitting home.
 

 I always assumed people judged me for not being able to drive. I assumed they thought I was incapable or dramatic but my partner told me one day that their boss had asked about me and why I didn't drive. They said she thought how sad it must be, not because I was so old but because I couldn't just take myself out for a cup of coffee if I wanted to. They talked about how it can be so isolating.
 

 They're not wrong. I never put it in that perspective. All I think about is how awkward it can be for me asking for rides or being an inconvience but I never thought about how bad I do want to just drive to the store for milk or run through starbucks for coffee.
 

 I'm really terrified but I want to try. Does anyone know of any tips that can help me behind the wheel? It's been over ten years now and even before then it was just a few loops in a lot.
 

 Sorry for the long rant 😭"
"I've had social anxiety for 13 years (32M).
 

 It's gotten better and I can function pretty well to what I would describe as ""semi-high functioning"" social anxiety.
 

 Something I cannot shake however is a physical fear response in my face, mostly with women, where the muscles around my eyes and mouth/nasolabial folds begin to be pulled and pushed as if phantom hands were controlling them, and I'm working extremely hard to keep my face looking natural. I'd say the expression my face wants to make is either one of fear or defensive aggression. This all comes from CPTSD.
 

 The symptoms subside if I look away or have alcohol in my system, but obviously that creates problems with the listener because it's either interpreted as lack of confidence or indifference towards what they are saying.
 

 I have no idea how to turn this off and the response feels impossible to control. I have been to both normal therapy and am currently working through EMDR with some success, but the symptoms remain.
 

 Has anyone been able to conquer symptoms like these? How did you do it?"
"This is gonna be a long post so buckle up, I'm basically writing my life story. I really didn't know where to post this. And I think I wrote it like shit and reiterated things a few times but I'm too lazy to look through all this shit to fix it lol. As the title says, I'm a 32 year old guy, I'm chronically single, never got a driver's license, and live at my mom's. I dropped out of high school and ended up mostly hiding away with depression. I have come a long way in the past couple years, in that before I got my first job at 29, I dreaded being judged for not having had a job, and never tried. Been working ever since. I always wanted to fix my life beforehand, but could never pull myself out of it and never sought out mental health treatment. 
 

 I got my permit for the second time a few months ago, but have yet to practice at all. I kept putting it off. It is embarrassing to be 32 and never having driven, and I truly do NOT want to be seen handling a car shittily in a parking lot. However I drive 3 different forklifts at work and am confident I can pick it up quickly, so I think I can bite that bullet. It's just taking the time out of rest and relaxation(working 50 hour weeks right now), and probably having to have my mom, who I don't get along with, tag-along to teach me, that is difficult. And well, kind of ruminating about my life. I'm having a hard time finding the motivation and pushing out all the bullshit so I can finally get rid of this spectre, get my own place, and be independent, and hopefully someone I want to be with will see the good in me.
 

 Another issue is, I haven't had much romantic experience. I had a situationship that lasted a couple years, where I wasn't very attracted to the girl, but shittily extended it because I truly enjoyed the closeness and the mental chemistry, but didn't get the sexual experience I needed to feel 100% comfortable because I barely saw her irl. This ended eventually. I met a girl through online dating about 6 months ago, we hung out 3 times, had sex once, she ended up needing mental health treatment, and she slowly pushed me out of her life over 3 months. Not totally sure if that one was her or me, but I liked her a lot. I met another girl a few months ago, I didn't know if I truly liked her, and saw what happened with the first girl starting to happen, and eventually had to put an end to it so as to not prolong her suffering. So, I haven't had any(real\* relationships more or less. 
 

 I was talking to another girl recently as well that I was actually into, who actually seemed into me, but she backed out with a lame excuse before our date, and I stopped talking to her. Aside from having a handful of girls where there was mutual interest in high school, that I didn't pursue like I should have out of some body insecurity, this is all I've got in that area. I redownloaded tinder a couple weeks ago and god it has been disappointing. Having a girl unmatch me instantly after I messaged her stung pretty bad. I've been told I'm attractive plenty before, not amazingly but still, even though I'm a bit overweight but not huge, and I think I can be a fun, good partner, and don't even have my life situation on my profile(lol), but still can't find anyone up to my not crazy standards to even get to know me. 
 

 I don't really have many friends. I don't hang out with anyone outside of work, aside from discord voice chat and gaming, where I have a few great friends. I'm also not really around a lot of people throughout my day. We have only 4 people at work right now, no women. When it comes to meeting new people, I kinda have poor expectations that anything positive will happen. 
 

 I'm an introvert, I like to talk facts and about my interests, and everything else kinda builds off of that. Most people seem to like to talk about experiences or tell stories, and make connections through that. I have such a hard time breaching the divide. Not being self-sufficient definitely doesn't help in the conversation fuel department. I also have somewhat fringe interests compared to most people. But even when I imagine making friends with someone with similar interests, I just expect that they'll know more than me and just see me as not good enough. 
 

 Sometimes I feel confident, sure in my purpose and who I am, easily suppress my insecurities and skip straight to speaking what's on my mind and am confident in my thoughts, and don't need anyone's approval, other times it's like I'm observing others to try to figure out what kind of conversation they like, and watching for thoughts that fit that mold, and just get kinda paralyzed, unable to stop this process. I'm just fucking lonely in general and it's so hard to break out of that process so I can just be my authentic self, and probably be more interesting as a result. Then being aware of the social value of a shift to that just makes being authentic difficult. I get along with my coworkers decently well but there's times where they're all chatting and I'm off to the side just NOT participating at all and not interested, and it just makes me anxious. 
 

 Am I not talking because I'm not interested, or like a social battery thing, or am I not talking because they weren't interested in approaching me - like just something off about me that I don't know about? Sometimes I get so in my head that I know I do NOT look like I'm in a good mood and I think that repels them. They're good dudes and try to make sure I'm alright but it's tough. I think these thoughts are pretty pointless but man I have so little going on sometimes that I just can't distract myself. It's like I pick at myself because that's all there is to do. I used to be really upset whenever I had anxiety(I mostly isolated myself in my 20s because I didn't want to be seen anxious) and would maybe stammer a little bit or struggle to find words, but I mostly present myself decently well these days and don't dwell too hard if I don't. But really, sometimes I feel interested and alone and unconnected, then other times uninterested or like people are too much work and hard to please.
 

 So like, I know I just have to soldier on and get that stupid driver's license and this loneliness will probably be much easier to defeat, as well as maybe lose some weight or whatever, but I'm just having such a hard time motivating myself. Deep down I do like myself and enjoy life. I think there's a woman out there who'll get that my life has kinda been a result of bad luck rather than a reflection of my potential, that I will actually like. But sometimes I just get so trapped in my cycle - the work week, coming home and needing to relax on the weekend, being stuck in the house because I can't drive, and no friends to go out with that have my same interests, ugh. Being stuck in the same thoughts, environment, habits. I just don't want to be stuck in this cycle forever and never move an inch in life. I need to do things more often that I actually can improve right now, like read books, play my bass, and work out. I've been trying. 
 

 Like I kinda know what I need to do in general, it's just \*doing\* it that's that hard part. I'm sure getting mental health treatment would help a lot. I really want more friends, I want more people to like me, I want to be respected and valued, there's just so many stopgaps that I don't even know whether it's because of anxiety, life circumstance, lack of experience, lack of interest on my part, or just ""me"". Sometimes I feel like I'm on the cusp of figuring my shit out, being confident and strong, rational rather than emotional, but it never fully sets into place. My brain is a fucking mess. I'm tired of thinking about this shit. Not thinking about me so much and actually doing or enjoying things would help everything. 
 

 So idk! I never make posts like this and thought I would I guess. I tell strangers intimate details about my life like zero times ever so I thought maybe it would make me feel better? Maybe I already know what you guys will have to say, as I've watched and read so much shit involving self-improvement and wracked my brain for years, but maybe someone has some insight I've been lacking. I don't fully hate myself and am strangely something of an eternal optimist despite having had a VERY unconventional life and having spent so much time depressed in the past. Typing this after a tough and anxious night and then morning made me feel a lot better and more like myself. I'm just frustrated after working my ass off holding down a job over a year with no signs of going back to how I was, having put a lot of effort into recent romantic endeavors, and life just truly not getting any better yet. I just feel so fucking stuck. 
 

 Maybe I'm just fucked? Maybe once I fix my shit I'll be dateable? Maybe I should STOP taking chances with dating apps until my life is fixed? Maybe I can meet someone who'll get me and kinda fill me up emotionally and light a fire under me, and not dip before anything develops? Maybe I just need therapy(that I really do not want to pay for). It just fucking blows being held down by the fact that my life didn't go right in the past. It sucks believing there's good inside you that no one gives a chance or wants to see. I just don't want to miss out on having a great relationship. I'm young still, but the clock is ticking. So idk! If you have any feedback feel free!"
"I (32M) have only within the last year become aware of my anxiety and how it affects me. Today I had a revelation that my anxiety is probably entirely social anxiety and it puts so much of my life and my most anxious moments into context.
 

 I think of college - the anticipation of going out filled me negative emotion and so I often opted to stay in with my roommates. Even though I almost always had fun when I went out.
 

 I think of a time last year when I was going to meet up with a friend I hadn't seen in forever and the day we were supposed to meet up, I almost started feeling sick. Nauseous, shaky, and just generally not calm. He texted me to cancel due to possible covid exposure and a wave of relief washed over me.
 

 I think of every time at work when I'm worried what my boss will think. I'm never worried about failing - I'm only worried that they'll think I made a bad choice.
 

 I think of my complete aversion to calling in to make appointments for the dentist/optometrist/etc.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 But the thing is, I know that if I push through the anxiety, it's almost always fine. I actually like being around people and making conversation and I'm pretty good at it and I know people like me and respect me.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 But goddamn is it hard to push through the anxiety anyways. It's made all the worse when I'm going through a depressive bout and all I want to do is stay curled up in bed all day but stupid hunger and responsibility mean I can't do that.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Still, I consider it a win to be able to recognize the trigger points of my anxiety. To put things into context.
 

 What's funny to me is that the cause of my revelation was because I was talking to someone and I mentioned my anxiety but called it ""social anxiety"" just because I thought that would be more understandable in the context. I walked way realizing that ""oh, it actually *is* social anxiety, isn't it?""
 

 Edit: Actually the other part is I was considering asking someone out but we had only just met and were both there for a class and didn't have much time to chat. So I was worried that asking her out at the end might be too desperate, and instead I should just hope to run into her again but having walked away - anyways, I'm sure most of you recognize that train of thought and in reality it probably wouldn't have hurt to just try. But. Anxiety."
It seems like my body just doesnt want to eat when anxiety hits me and it sucks because im already pretty thin so i lose alot of weight
"I’ve [32M] been medicating and treating my Social Anxiety for about a year now (alprazolam, Zoloft, and therapy). Things are going pretty well, I feel like I’ve reached a good equilibrium when it comes to balancing out my brain chemistry. 
 

 I’ve been working the same job since I graduated high school 15 years ago. I’ve been working for my dad in a direct-mail marketing firm that specializes in generating sales leads for insurance agents. It’s something that basically just fell into my lap when I was 17 and freshly out of high school, and the pay has always been enough for me to swallow my pride and do whatever the job asked from me. I work from home, my only real interactions with other people are talking to the people who work at the post office and dealing with my dad. It’s a pretty low-stress situation in the day-to-day sense, but I endure a lot of abuse from my dad/boss. Nothing physical obviously, but the constant reminders that I’d be nowhere without his help and the impending collapse of our business model (which he’s been spouting since day 1) make me feel like I desperately need to make a career change. I have no intentions of taking over the company in the future, and I have reached my peak in pay/position. I just want to have some semblance of agency over my life. 
 

 I’ve tried going to online/night school over the years and just constantly feel like I’m running into the wall of having no idea what path I WANT to pursue. I’ve knocked out 50 hrs worth of college credits, covering all the core pre-reqs that most curriculums require. I’m really just at the point of needing to pick something to specialize in. I’ve kicked around a few ideas over the years, but haven’t had much success. 
 

 Initially I was interested in the medical field. I was pre-med and trying to aim for an MD in a non-patient facing role (ie pathology or radiology), but multiple disruptions in my time as a student have more-or-less taken that option away. I need a career path that isn’t going to require 6+ years of training (not to mention residency/speciality training). I’ve accepted that that’s just not in the cards for me at this point in my life (I turn 33 in a couple months, I can’t wait until I’m 40+ to break away from my current life situation). 
 

 I’ve basically put my own desires on the back-burner with the hope that I can at the very least get an associates degree in something/anything and work towards a future that I will actually enjoy at some point. My priority now is simply to make myself hire-able. 
 

 Multiple people have told me to pursue a degree in computers/programming, but I really don’t feel like I have the capability. My tech-skills really boil down to knowing how to troubleshoot my boomer parents computer issues. I’ve tried to learn coding and it’s just not something I have any real grasp of. I’ve also tried enrolling twice in IT-field programs with my school and have been told night/online is not an option. Maybe my advisor is just a dick, but it feels like a dead end for me. 
 

 So here’s the question all of this has been leading up to: what is a 2-year program I can complete (that is not customer-facing) that I can use as a springboard towards advancing to a career? My whole life people have been telling me to just go to college and I’ll figure out what I want to do. 15+ years and 50 hrs of credits later, I’m still as lost as I was at 18. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
So my occupational therapist been working on Going further outside and we've been doing it for a while now but she told me it was ending soon all that progress is going to go back to square one cause she's the only one I've found to trust and only one that's actually helped me this far. I might get a new OT Maybe but takes time getting to know these people qnd usually they aren't as helpful sadly I wish I could do my walks on my own but agoraphobia is way to hard and it takes years. Absolute bummer that it's ending maybe I can get further input ftom her in future I doubt it though. sucks being mentally ill 🥲
"Hi, I've been having heart related anxiety for a while now, but keeping busy and distracted which makes me worry less. But just now as I'm sitting in my chair just chilling I got a sudden jolt from out of nowhere, felt it in my head. It's kinda like that hypnic jerk you somtimes get just before falling asleep. 
 Anyone ever had this while awake just sitting doing nothing? 
 

 Don't know how to explain it any clearer"

"I(30F) am reaching out to those who need a friend. I don't have many in real life anymore, but I heard people make internet friends! I haven't ever done that myself. I always feel like everyone is annoyed with me. So if you feel the same way, please leave a comment or send me a message. I know that isn't an easy thing to do but I promise I'm a super open-minded individual. Social anxiety is hard. Let's try to talk! I'm listening to a band called Cannons right now.

"So I changed my daughter's poopy diaper. I wiped my fingers with her Pampers Sensitive wipes, then I think I wiped the changing table with it. I keep second guessing myself. Anyways, then I got a new diaper and put it on quick. My husband fixes it for me while I go wash my hands. I am now thinking I got poop all over her diaper and now him and her clothes since I used the same wipe for both. Am I overreacting? She will be fine right? Ug, I hate feeling like this."

"Echoing many fellow Redditors and citizens in the U.S.
 

 I'm so tired. I've had regressions around flying, movie theaters, parades, Grocery stores, and public restaurants off and on for years. I've been nervous, perpetually, since 9/11, Columbine, OK City and seeing ""An Inconvenient Truth"". 
 

 I'm 30 years old, and after this last round of shootings, I'm about ready to let the fear win. I'm about ready to only see people inside their homes, to limit air travel, make home an oasis, and live quietly. Nothing ever feels safe for more than 5 minutes. I'm terrified to have children and feel sorry for every child I meet.
 

 For some, a homebody life is empty and sad, but I think I could be pretty darn happy. I hate feeling like I could be killed at the grocery store or on vacation. Statistics and ""likelihood"" numbers don't help. 
 

 I traveled abroad and adventured a ton in my teens and 20s, and sometimes I think I've gambled with fate enough. No more adventures sounds good on days like today. 
 

 Ugh. 💔😵‍💫😶‍🌫️"
"I am 32 and have struggled in the pandemic with worrying about my parents finances. My dads business has not done well in the pandemic and he cannot seem to let it go, putting my parents into debt they were not in before. They are closing in on retirement age and I worry about how they will retire and live.
 

 My mom is a teacher, they own a house (not paid off) and have lived a very middle class life. 
 

 Ways to cope with not worrying so much? I own my own business too and have been successful with it. It gives me major anxiety when my dad talks to me about his business (I think he feels he can confide in me because I’m a business owner too)."
"I [34M] have been dealing with headaches for a very long time. I tend to have about 15 headaches a month, all caused by anxiety. I was anxiety free until the Marine Corps changed my mindset. When something goes wrong in the Corps no matter how minute it is it gets blown out of proportion. Well, that has conditioned me to not be capable of handling even the smallest of adversities of the day without blowing it out of proportion in my mind, just as I've been conditioned. I can't function around people whatsoever, so much so that I don't want to see my family and only want to stay home when I'm not at work. I'm not sure if I explained this clearly enough because my mind is currently foggy due to a headache. How have any of you been able to clear your head to prevent headaches caused by anxiety?"
"My anxiety comes from a place of reflecting on myself and being afraid of my emotions- if I get angry, or sad, or afraid, I feel like I have to be really careful not to act on those emotions because they are intense, but then I feel like I shift mindsets and I’m afraid of the way I may come across to people. I do find that having compassion on myself helps, but does anyone else feel this way? Like you almost can’t control who you are bc you can’t see it until later? Sometimes it’s like a veil comes over me in an emotion and I don’t realize how I was feeling or know what other people thought, and it bothers me way more than it should."
This is a hair width from how paranoid I am any way walking my dog it's a nice day I look st the nice blue sky and clouds my brain automatically goes to I'm going to get sucker up into the sky I start panicking I try telling myself it's mot going to happen but my brain insists that this is going to happen and its a real threat its a pain sigh

"I apologize if this is long. I have rauma induced germaphobia. Raw meat is a huge issue for me, especially how my husband cooks. His brother brought over frozen chicken wings from his freezer. Lives about 25 minutes away, so start to thaw. Left them on our counter for a bit. I was on a call with a customer service person since something wasn't delivered, so thats why I was around and saw what happened.They decided they didn't want to wait to thaw so, he went ahead to grill them. He put one on the grill then wipes his hands on his pants. Came in touching the door knob and closet door knob. He then went to wash his hands. I wiped the door knows down after he left, but he had already touched them again and touching other stuff. He grabbed tongs and reached them in a bag to grab some more and then cooked with them. After they had obviously touched the inside of the bag as well. Someone else grabbed them and had them against their shortcwhen bringing them in to clean them, not realizing this. I had mentioned something to my husband and he said It's fine, not gonna kill you. Its only miniscule anyway. I said it's gross, even if still frozen. He said just trust me. He said it's covered in frozen water and it's fine. I shook my head because I was having bad anxiety. I had to walk away. So he's touching everything, passing stuff to others. They are touching stuff and moved my daughter's toys. I'm freaking out that we are gonna get sick and I'm also pregnant. When everyone leaves, I'm about to spray the house with my lysol can. Am I overreacting? I know pregnancy and my germaphobia doesn't help. I'm not looking for criticism either, I just wondering if I am going to far in thinking this. And want to protect my child and myself."

"I’m 30M and I went to be assessed for ADHD. I was diagnosed with that and, I thought, only that. But I received a copy of the report that was sent to my PCP and it says I was also diagnosed with major depressive and social anxiety disorder. Major depressive I can wrap my head around. I don’t really feel anxious in, or in anticipation of, social interactions unless it’s like a job interview or something similar. I might feel awkward, but never anxious. I’m an introvert, but from my amateur’s understanding it’s not the same thing. Case and point, I recently met up with a stranger I met on Facebook irl. He has the same facial disability as me, and we just wanted to meet for lunch and talk. It was nice. We ate and talked for a couple hours. From my understanding of social anxiety, this doesn’t really seem like the sort of thing I’d be willing or maybe even able to do. All that being said, I’m not a mental health professional, nor do I play on TV. So I’m very open to the idea that I could be missing something. Is there anyone else here diagnosed with this condition who can enlighten me? I am genuinely confused and curious."
"I am all out of whack lately. Every year in august, like clockwork, my health anxiety and physical health ailments spike and last for 2-3 months. Still in the thick of it right now. 
 

 Last august I had a terrible case of hives (never experienced that before), the week after returning to work from an extended time off, which was also coincidentally the same week my entire household got head lice. I was so stressed out with everything, my anxiety was going through the roof. It’s no surprise I ended up covered in red, itchy blotches 
 

 This year, health issues appeared in august again. I have been eating terribly lately. Mainly because I’m so stressed and anxious, which automatically makes my appetite disappear. I’ve been living off of about 500 food calories a day for weeks, and usually all I have for dinner is alcohol. Shameful, I know. No wonder I woke up in the middle of the night with the worst abdominal pain I could ever imagine. 7 hours later it hadn’t subsided so I went to the ER. I was diagnosed with colitis and told to eat small, frequent, bland foods. Haven’t done as well as I should following that plan. I was supposed to go see a gastro dr, but living in FL means my appt was cancelled due to the hurricane and i have to wait 2 months for the next opening. 
 

 Next up in my not so fun health adventures is some mysterious itchy skin condition plaguing my partner and I. He had it first and apparently transmitted it to me. None of the doctors can figure out what it is, and meds don’t help. I’m up all night scratching my skin. I also have some issues going on in the nether regions, so I spend my free time scrolling Dr. google trying to figure out if it’s herpes, uti, or a yeast infection. I know my partner has been unfaithful lately, so really my diagnosis is anybodys guess. 
 

 Went for blood work this morning for the first time in 3 years and passed out in the chair. This is the second time I’ve passed out while getting labs drawn. They offered to call me an ambulance, but who can pay that bill? I’ll just drive myself home and hope for the best. 
 

 I know how strong the relation is between mental and physical health, but i feel just stuck in a trap right now. My mental health is bad, which causes poor appetite/sleeping, which causes health problems, which exacerbates my health anxiety, and the merry go round just keeps on going. 
 

 I am 33 years old and have been dealing with this since my late teens. Therapy doesn’t help. Meds don’t help. I am at my wits end."
"Hello all,
 

 My life has run smack into a brick wall, and it's 100% my fault.
 

 I [32M] have been married for right at 8 years with a 6 year old son, and I think I have finally pushed her too far.
 

 Long story short, I was a ""gifted"" child and had a father constantly telling me how much smarter I was than everyone around me from as early as I can remember. Early school was a breeze and I was able to breeze through tests with zero effort outside of halfway paying attention. Unfortunately, this apathetic approach led to a decline in my academic performance in middle and high school, which in turn exacerbated my feelings of inadequacy and (as I'm finally ready to admit) anxiety. I've had mild panic attacks for at least 20 years now that I tried to convince myself was an abnormal heart rhythm to avoid admitting that I had a problem that I couldn't control with pure will power, this is an issue of mine resulting from negative side effects I experienced from age 4-18 when I was prescribed amphetamines for my ADD. I've spent so much time trying to run away and hide from my own feelings that I've subconsciously come to resent myself, which has in turn caused me to fall into a trap of channeling that anxiousness into anger. This is how I've torn apart my marriage and my family.
 

 I won't go into to many details, but my wife and I are currently separated and that space has forced me to have to try to confront these feelings as I can't do what I used to and take out my frustrations at my own shortcomings on my wife and son by yelling and overreacting to small things like dishes not being done, house not vacuumed, etc. I don't blame her for wanting me gone and not talking to me right now, even though that's all I want to do along with hug my son. I'm scared this is the straw that broke the camel's back, and it pains me to think that this horrible version of me is how both of them will see me for the rest of their lives.
 

 It's been 8 days since our falling out started, and 5 days since I've spoken to either of them at all, she has cut contact currently. Again, I don't blame her for that as I have been a terrible husband and father for a couple years now as the anger has taken over more and more of my life.
 

 I have an appointment to see a counselor on Tuesday to start working on my anger management and I'm also considering looking into an autism evaluation as I've noticed some similarities in how my emotional outbursts manifest and given that autism was under diagnosed in the early 90s when I was diagnosed with ADD, I wonder if I've been trying to treat the wrong thing all this time.
 

 Not sure what I hoped to accomplish with this post, but I've written enough letters and notes to myself to try to process my thoughts over these few days, and as much as I know they want to help, I'm still struggling to be fully open about all my feelings with my parents. And it doesn't exactly help that two of their most consistent coping recommendations is to just ""wait and see how this plays out"" and ""she isn't blameless in this either."" I guess I felt that finally talking about this to a group of strangers would be a good way to start getting more comfortable with opening up about my feelings.
 

 Thanks for listening.
 

 Also, I'm currently reading ""before you split"" by toni nieuwhof, and although I'm not religious in any way it's scary how many direct parallels I can draw to my own life. I hope that these waves of emotion I feel when I realize I'm doing some of these exact things I'm reading in this book are a good sign that maybe I'll actually be able to make some real changes this time."
"Context: I (32M) have been on and off sertraline / Zoloft for 3 years to help me to deal with GAD, OCD (health anxiety). I’ve came back to sertraline 5 weeks ago - 1 week of 25mg and now it’s 4 weeks of 50mg.
 Still early days to feel huge improvements, but my OCD is more controllable now. Side effects I had from early days and always had: excessive sweating, nightmares, difficulty to orgasm and also some dizziness due anxiety.
 

 Last two/three days I’ve been feeling shaky hands and legs. Sometimes I can see myself shaking just a bit but it’s a weird vibration feeling I feel all over my body. I also feel heavy head and headaches. Never felt shaky on this medicine although it might cause this side effect.
 

 Anyone could relate to this? Specially after 4 weeks of increased dose it’s strange to have new side effect."
"I (31F) have always, since I was a teenager, struggled with feeling like I just don't cope as well with life in general as my peers. And if I make a mistake at work or something I really beat myself up about it. My overwhelm and worry gets so bad that it makes me really low in mood. It's got to the point I'm having anxiety attacks every day before work and I don't really do anything except go to work and then come home again, cos I'm so exhausted and overwhelmed just from maintaining my job and keeping myself alive. I look at my peers and they all seem to juggle so many things in their lives and I just don't understand why I can't be like that, I guess. I just started taking regular medication for it (Quetiapine), I've signed up for the free counselling and CBT service my local NHS provides and I'm gonna start going to some local meditation sessions, but I guess I just need any other advice people could give me? Thanks in advance!"
"I suffer from heavy panic attacks that last for days well i had one last night and when i get them i cant eat ,sleep or do anything except think while my mind races all day and night it usually lasts about 5 to six days like this well im tired of it and i cant miss work so i need to break the cycle my doctor gave me valium to get some sleep im nervous tho he gave me 5mg i dont know how i will react but i hope i sleep well"
"I am 34 years old male ,married and have SA ,i inherited SA from my father.I want to make children but afraid that my kids will also have SA .Need advices from you."
"For that, I am proud of you.
 

 

 Like you, I woke up this morning riddled with anxiety that made no sense. 
 I tried to figure out exactly what was making me feel uneasy, and I was certain I wasn’t going to make it through the day.
 

 Like you, I soldiered on. 
 

 Like you, I survived today. 
 

 

 Some days are harder than others, but remember you are so unbelievably strong. If people knew what a struggle most days are, we would be receiving an award every day for making it through.
 

 You are amazing, brave and turned another page in your story. You are loved, and here you are supported xx"
"In 2017, the only father I've ever known told me that I wasn't his biological son in the middle of me trying to break up an argument between him and my mother. The argument had nothing to do with that fact, and looking back on it, I feel that he only told me this to hurt my mother.
 

 I remember speaking with her on to the phone that night and saying that he didn't make sense. When I told her what he said she broke down a balled her eyes out on the phone.
 

 

 I'm 32 years old. I was 27 when this happened. 
 

 My non biological father has always been an alcoholic, but It wasn't in until 2019 and literally finding out that my entire life was not what I thought it was, that I realised his behaviour wasn't what normal dad's do. I actually looked up to him before that incident.
 

 Because I didn't notice the behaviours like:
 

 Drinking every day
 

 Doing everything you can not attend social events with your spouse
 

 Not celebrating birthdays or anniversaries 
 

 Barely helping with house work
 

 Never cooking or doing laundry to help your wife that works full time.
 

 Blaming your wife for financial woes when you drink like a fish and smoke like chimney every day
 

 It wasn't until he told me that I wasn't his biological son did I start to look back on my life and remember things from my childhood that I had forgotten.
 

 Like the time he was drunk and told me that he knew he wasn't a good husband but he was ok with that as long as he was a good dad.
 

 Or when him and my mother got into an argument over a blanket and he punched her in the eye. I still remember her crying and screaming over 15 years ago and me just sitting in bed not knowing what to do.
 

 I remember him telling my teenage self and my younger brother to tell people that she got hit in the face with a tennis ball if anyone asked.
 

 I remember him sitting my brother and I down one day and telling us that there was something wrong with our mother that caused her to act out and have ""hissy fits"".
 And her medication would fix it.
 

 That word is now a trigger for me. 
 

 What I now know is that my mother was under huge stress from having a deadbeat alcoholic husband who barely lifted a finger and manipulated his children to take his side over his wive's. Now that I have to take anti anxiety medication every day I realise that she did then too. The difference is my wife supports me but he didn't support his .
 

 I remember when she tried to get him to do something he would roll his eyes and be condescending to make her feel like she was nagging.
 

 As a now 32 year old man I reflect on these memories and my heart beats faster at the thought of how much that piece of shit mistreated my mother throughout my child hood. I will never treat my wife like he treated my mother.
 

 Circumventing back to 2017.
 

 A month after finding out I was adopted, he got into an argument with a neighbour across the street from where my parents lived, walked back to the house, grabbed a pipe and then went back across the street and assaulted the neighbour. He was drunk, of course 
 

 He was arrested and eventually went to prison for (only) 3 months. 
 

 I was eventually diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and suffered multiple panic attacks at my place of employment. It got so bad that I had to leave in 2020.
 

 I was on the phone to an abusive customer, I got so angry that I saw black. I've never been so angry. I felt like I could have killed someone. I had the biggest panic attack I've ever experienced in my life that day. I felt like the room was closing in around me. My hands started to cramp closed and I couldn't open them. I couldn't stand up straight and immediately was hyperventilating.
 

 I didn't return to work for 4 weeks and eventually handed in my resignation. 
 

 Every time I would try and return to work in the period my anxiety would peak and I would have to leave.
 

 I've been on medication since then, but it's been a long journey and that wasn't the last time my anxiety has become too difficult to live with.
 

 Since my father telling me I wasn't his biological son in an argument and assaulting someone, he has:
 

 Drunk driven and threatened suicide , verbally disrespected me in front of my now wife because he was mad at me for telling my mother that he didn't deserve her and she should leave him, Messaged me out of the blue while drunk trying to talk shit about my mother and Tried to gaslight me when I called him out of hitting my mother when I was young.
 

 I have not spoken a single word to the person who I thought was my father, since 2020. I have completely cut him out of my life. Since then, I have bought a house, married in my wife, found a fantastic job and own a beautiful dog and cat, and 4 chickens 
 

 My life has flourished without that toxic excuse of a human being in it. 
 

 Fast forward to now. 
 

 My brother posted on social media last weekend his dad has just advised him he has been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and has 12 months to live.
 

 Part of me thinks that ""my father"" is a lying piece of shit and is trying to crawl his way back into everyone's lives by getting sympathy that he doesn't deserve.
 

 The other part of me thinks it's karma catching up with him and he deserves it.
 

 My brother is grieving. I feel numb. Cold.
 

 I spoke with a councillor at work and advised them that I have constant nightmares about being at my family home as a child. I have nightmares about seeing him now as an adult and doing violent things to him for what he did to my mother when I was young. (I'm opposed to violence- just to clarify )
 

 She said that I was showing signs of PTSD.
 

 Over the last 5 years, I've known people who had died. Good people. 
 And yet he still roams the earth.
 I may be young compared to alot of others out there but I am comfortable in myself that I choose who my family is. Nobody else. I choose who deserves my respect and forgiveness.
 

 In 5 years, he hasnt shown me a single reason to show he deserves anything else than what he has now.
 

 I know it won't cure my of anxiety when his actions catch up with him, nor will it stop the nightmares.
 

 I'm not really sure how to end this, I'm not trying to write a novel or get Karma. I'm just trying to put how I feel into words.
 

 If you made it this far, thank you."
"I posted this in another sub but for this sub, I wanted to add a note that someone here recommended ashwagandha to help with anxiety and it's had a real positive impact on me for the past few days.
 

 I was reading a really interesting thread about the effects of open air nuclear testing on human health/DNA and one of the comments highlighted how any exposure to radiation is dangerous to the body. 
 

 I've obviously known that x rays and other imaging tests use radiation (hence the lead covering) but generally I've only ever gotten them done when it seemed necessary (dentist appointments, serious injuries). But this made me think back to when I had covid back in May. My cough lingered for almost 2 weeks, which wasn't concerning in itself, but I had tightness/soreness in my chest after coughing, which I read can be a serious symptom.
 

 I went to urgent care and they did an x-ray to confirm that my lungs looked clear. But I feel like this was an unnecessary test given the recency of my covid recovery and now I'm just angry at the doctor and at myself for how a bad post-covid cough exposed me to radiation unnecessarily. I know nothing can be done about it now but it makes me feel so anxious to think of how much danger we may expose ourselves to under ""professional guidance."""
"I'm 31 and have been on Zoloft for about 15 years now, ranging from 100mg to 250mg at the highest. Switching to Viibryd and just \*loving\* all the side effects of the SSRI withdrawal. This is more or less a post to chronicle my personal experiences with the tapering process so others can get an idea of what side effects you might expect. As usual, all bodies are different and what may be the case for me may not be the case for you, so ymmv!
 

 The bulk of the side effects tend to occur within 1-3 days of the initial lowered dosage. So, if I took 50mg on Sunday night, I'd continue 50mg until the next Sunday and then drop down 10-25mg. The side effects would be strongest Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday after the night I dropped the dosage. My psych wanted me to taper 50mg at a time, but I was like ""BRO IF YOU WANT ME TO TAKE A VACATION TO GRIPPY SOCK CITY, SURE, BUT I'MA GO SLOWER.""
 

 My Zoloft came in 100mg pills and I'd cut about 1/4 off each pill with a pill cutter as I tapered down. Once I hit 50mg, I got 50mg pills and would cut about 1/3 off for each taper. It's not precise by any means, which may play some role in the side effects.
 

 Here are some of the main side effects I've noticed in no particular order:
 

 * **Irritability/rage issues**. It's crazy how much more irritable I get in those initial few days after a drop in dosage. The first round I dropped 25mg, I literally sat at my desk (work from home ftw) and angry cried for a full 30 minutes at \*literally nothing.\* Everything was annoying tome... The dogs, my partner, the air, the floor, trees. Everything. And there was a marked lack of control in my emotions that was just overwhelming as hell in a way I've never experienced, even during intense EMDR therapy. 
 * **Extreme fatigue.** I've been so tired lately that I literally had a dream last night about being tired lol. It's rare that I sleep in past like 9am, but lately I've been pushing 11:30am on weekends and really struggling to wake up for work on week days. I'm confident this is a side effect of tapering because I take Temazepam/Restoril for insomnia and haven't had issues with fatigue like this until the tapering began.
 * **Periods of intense anxiety.** Shocker, right? I'll be sitting here and suddenly my heart starts pounding and I start turning red in the cheeks and my nervous system is like HELP THERE'S A FIRE while my brain's like ""haha no clue anyways let's work!""
 * **Digestive issues**. Let's talk about poopin! It's more difficult when you taper. This may be because my anxiety tends to manifest as gastrointestinal distress, but still, lots of upset lower body issues, lots of cramps (nothing severe but still annoying), lots of general unpleasantness.
 * **Cold/Flu-like symptoms.** Initially, I thought I was getting Autumnal allergies when I started getting a runny nose, headaches, and general achy body parts. Alas, allergy levels have been low in my area, and I know I'm not sick, so I'm pretty confident it's the Zoloft flushing from my system. Or rather my brain rebelling at the lack of Zoloft.
 * **Brain fog.** So much fun. Self explanatory. Feels like my attention span is shot, my short term memory is shot, and it's generally more difficult to think through things.
 * **M O O D S W I N G S.** This could be part of the irritability bullet point, but they're severe enough to warrant their own. The mood swings are atrocious. It's like being on your period times a thousand. There's very little I can do to control my mood.
 

 Sounds fun, right? At the moment, I'm on day 3 after a drop in dosage, and my main issues have been allergy-like symptoms... Sore throat, headache, nose decides to run for no reason at times, very very very fatigued, etc. Yesterday and the day before were particularly bad with mood swings.
 

 But for those who are thinking of tapering, I do have some insight on treating each of these side effects!
 

 * **Eat 3 meals a day minimum.** Again, seems like obvious self care stuff, but it really is easier to feel terrible when you're not getting energy from food. Obviously healthy/nutrition-dense food is best, but honestly just make sure you're eating regularly even if it's pop tarts and kool aid. Make sure to get a good amount of potassium to prevent muscle cramps and balance your carbs and protein so you have some solid energy reserves.
 * **I know it's the worst but I gotta say it- exercise.** Listen, I do not like working out. I have a personal trainer who I absolutely adore, I'm a roller derby player, I'm decently fit, but I just don't like working out. Still, getting your body moving really does improve your mood noticeably. Have you heard the whole ""an object in motion stays in motion/An object at rest stays at rest"" thing? It applies HARD here. If you're tired and crabby, get up, swing your arms around, do a little jog in place, just get your body moving. Doesn't have to be a full workout, just enough to get your heart pumping for a few minutes. 
 * **Sunshine is a lifesaver.** I'm prone to seasonal depression, so ensuring I get a good amount of sunlight is always important. But since I've been tapering, I've noticed spending about 10 minutes in the sun is majorly effective for a temporary mood boost. I'd say the boost lasts at least an hour or two. Artificial sun lamps work alright, but getting out into real sunlight (especially if you have a garden or trees around) gives you a full body boost their your brain will thank you for.
 * ***Prepare a safety net for yourself.*** It's so so so so SO important to have a few people in your life who you can talk to about your emotional welfare. Get with your closest friends/family, explain to them you'll be tapering, and make sure they understand that you might be a little out of whack for a while. I've made sure to keep the communication channels 100% open with my partner since I've started tapering. When I'm feeling shitty, I let him know. When I get unreasonably angry with him, he knows it's part of the side effects, and I make sure to apologize afterwards and stay mindful during those intense moments. **You have to communicate with the people around you about these mood swings.** Don't excuse bad behavior and please do your best to be kind and mindful of your words, but make sure folks have a little more grace with you.
 

 Now that I've adequately wasted time in my work day typing this out, I'd love to see y'alls memes and words of encouragement. Let us know how tapering went for you. Ask questions about tapering! Send virtual high fives."
"I’m 1 year into a new career, in a new city. (I’m a minority race here). Just finding it so hard to fit in. But I keep feeling like everyone thinks I’m a weirdo. I’m just quiet, and to find the right words to say in conversation takes longer for me.
 

 I just got triggered in a zoom meeting when I said something and was met with total silence. With the people just staring blankly at me.
 

 Im just tired feeling misunderstood all the time. And no one really understands me here."
"Hello everyone I need some help understanding what's happening to me, I'm 34 generaly healthy although I do have some severe allergies at this time. For the last 2 days for no apparent reason with no apparent trigger I'm having what I can only describe as repeated but not severe anxiety symptoms: extreme fatigue, feeling of dread, loss of appetite, muscle weakness, shortness of breath. 
 

 No elevated heart rate, no sweating. These symptoms come and go with somewhat consistent frequency for the past 2 days like every 1-2 hours for about half an hour, than going away and coming back. They start like an hour or two after I wake up. 
 

 I have an anxiety attack once every few months or so but it usually lasts for 15 minutes and then goes away, this time it's very frequent and not going away. 
 

 I had my first anxiety attack 3 years ago and I panicked and went to the hospital thinking it's something wrong with my heart, they did planty of tests and said I'm perfectly fine and let me go. I am concerned about it being heart related since my father died of a heart attack many years ago but he wasn't a healthy person, I don't smoke, eat healthy and not overweight so I logically know it's probably not heart related but I'm still freaking out about it which doesn't help. I never had so many attacks over this long period of time, is this normal?
 

 I just tested my blood saturation, heart rate and blood pressure all normal, I'm not feeling any chest pain or tightness or arm, jaw or numbness or something like that it's just the symptoms I described above, but I'm still very very concerned."
"Hello,
 

 I have dealt with anxiety most of my life. I had panic attacks starting when I was 20 (I'm 34 now) and the fear of them has inhibited me from living a lot of my life. I had improved a little bit but the pandemic kind of ruined everything anxiety progress-wise. It's been tough since 2020 to even leave my house sometimes. Getting to work was OK, but I couldn't be spontaneous and had to meditate and do breathing exercises before leaving the house any other time usually. It eventually came to a head and was risking my marriage. 
 

 Long story short, I started taking 5mg Buspar on September 22, and 5mg 2x a day on the 25th. Slowly but surely, I have felt lots of positive things. The one downside is it makes me drowsy for 30 mins or so after taking it. But the Dr. said that might go away in time.
 

 I'm yammering, but the positive things that have been weird to adjust to revolve around not having as high anxiety anymore. It is really weird sometimes. And as each day goes by it's like a memory of something that's missing. I feel bored for the first time in years. I feel excitement and can identify it as excitement. I feel like I have structured my whole life around my anxiety and this is a chance for me to start fresh. I haven't dived head first like I'm not flying to Japan tomorrow.
 

 This whole rambling is moreso to ask: if your anxiety has gotten better with medication, did you feel the same? Like that it's weird to not have constant anxiety? That you almost don't know what to do or think. It's its own type of anxiety almost but it isn't all consuming.
 

 I just wanted to share my experience so far (and I hope it stays positive and that I can get used to this New Me) and see if others had similar experiences.
 

 Thanks.
 

 Oh and my screename is one of those auto generated ones. Kind of funny though for an anxiety subreddit."
"Is it normal to get very angry and upset when anxious? Or is this something else besides anxiety? 
 

 I often get very frustrated and angry at myself and/or my situation and will hit my head with my hands and have an urge to break or hit things (though I very rarely actually break anything since I still have just enough self restraint). This also only happens when I'm by myself. I can't / won't get to this point around others but can sometimes feel it building up.
 

 I have recently broken my glasses though by throwing them hard to the floor. And will also hit my fists against my desk or a door or something when the frustration/anger is intense. 
 

 The anger is accompanied by feelings of worthlessness and I guess things going wrong. Like the culmination of how upset I am with myself and my situation.
 

 Is this something fairly normal for anxious people or is it something else?
 

 What's very frustrating for me right now is I literally just saw my doctor and forgot to ask this."
"i'm at my wits end over here dealing with this for most of my life. i'm 30 now and while my social anxiety was pretty bad from around 13 years old to now... now it's just crippling. i can't have a normal conversation with anybody i'm not completely comfortable with (which is like 2 total people lol) without feeling like i'm dying inside.
 

 *am i maintaining enough eye contact?*
 

 *am i making too much eye contact?*
 

 *can he/she tell how nervous i am right now?*
 

 *why can't i think of anything to say?*
 

 *does this person see how awkward i am and think i'm weird?*
 

 like... it's so bad these days that i don't have any friends anymore because i've completely shut myself in. all i do now is work, workout in my free time, and sit in my apartment when i'm not doing the other two things because my anxiety has become so crippling that i just don't want to expose myself to those situations anymore. i feel way more safe just shut into my own space... which leads to depression because that isn't what i want my life to be. i want friends... i want to build relationships.. i want to show people the real me without feeling like i have to conceal everything all the time.
 

 has anybody had any success here with prescribed medication from a doctor? i know people say exposure therapy is the best way and all that.. but those people don't realize the fear that i feel when i put myself in those situations. i can't do anything. the only thing i think about is ending the interaction and walking away"
"A guy(32M) I was dating admitted to (30F)me how my body was unattractive, but I was still pretty. He said sometimes he wasn’t into having sex with me because of how I looked. He also said he didn’t enjoy spending time with me and how I wasn’t someone he was excited to be around for a long time again and how I wasn’t worth spending money on. 
 

 He has his own issues as well. I think he’s an alcoholic and is also insecure with himself and appearance as well. However, I keep replaying what he said in my head over and over again. It’s like a loop, and I start to feel depressed and sad. 
 

 It’s hard for me to get out of the house and do anything, because now I’m extremely insecure with how I look. I have high functioning anxiety and depression. It’s like I’m punishing myself in a way because I feel like I’m not deserving of doing anything that will make me feel good. I’m constantly looking in the mirror and disgusted with how I look now. It’s also difficult to do anything, when your heart is constantly racing and you feel like you physically can’t move because you’re frozen from the anxiety. 
 

 I’ve tried to overcome my social anxiety and just have the “fake it until you make it” persona, but people like him and even coworkers have said they can tell I don’t have any confidence and appear to be scared of the world. Now I constantly over analyze and worry about my appearance 24/7. 
 

 I’m also depressed that at this stage in life, I’m not the confident and beautiful woman who I thought I’d be. I also feel like time is running out and there’s no hope for me to get better. 
 

 Everyone tells me to stop worrying about what he said and what anyone thinks about me, but it’s easier said then done. How can I move past this ?"
"I have social anxiety, and I live in Tunisia. 
 

 Consequences : 
 

 I'm 30 years old, Never had a girlfriend even though i want to. Had sex twice even though its constantly on my mind. ( love &amp; intimacy are a taboo in our culture ) 
 

 What's worse, and this isn't my ego talking, i'm , according to social norms, a fairly good looking guy.
 

 Just to say that, some girls do make the first step, and i still fail to act on it. That's the worst thing for a someone's ego. I feel like shit.
 

 I rarely go out, and when i do, i feel rushes of adrenaline all the time especially around people upclose. Meeting new people is always a painful situation. I rarely pick up on people's body language when they like their idea of me. liking me is okay, liking me to the point where you'd want to have an intimate relationship with me ( as friends or more ) scares the shit out of me.
 

  
  So when i feel a person is too interested in me, i get anxious, and then silent. Nothing, my mind goes blank. All i think of, are images of intimacy between me and the person, whether its hugging if it's a friendly relationship, or having sexual intercourse. the ""wilder"" the image, the bigger you feel the anxiety hit you.
 

 Depending on the setup, and the number of people, i can go from mild anxiety to a panic attack in that situation ( which happened a couple times because I have always tried to avoid them ).
 

 I just realized an hour or so before writing this that i also have a fear of being abused ( physically/verbally ), it can go from mild to panic attacks or a violent reaction from me.

"Hey yall. After years of debilitating anxiety produced by PTSD, GAD, and SAD, and trying EVERY single non-narcotic medication, and multiple lifestyle changes, we were left with really no other options.
 

 I'm a recovering alcoholic. I've been sober for 1 month and 26 days. I really don't want to go down the addiction rabbithole again, especially considering these medications withdrawal can kill you.
 

 On my bottle, it says to take half-to-one tablet, 3 times daily, WHEN THINGS GET SEVERE. I plan on following these directions strictly, starting with half. And, I have given my bottle to my mom to hide somewhere in the house. 
 

 When I picked up my bottle, I talked to the pharmacist for a bit and she didn't really give me any advice other than it being Schedule 3. Pretty fucking useless information.

"Hello! I'm hoping I can get some advice here on this sub. I'm 32 years old and suffer from anxiety and depression. I finally decided that it is time for me to learn how to drive.. I've never driven before because I'm anxious about the thought of it. But when I saw my younger sister drive with my mum for the first time a few days ago it made a voice in my head say ""You can do this too."" and made me want to learn. Does anyone have any advice for me for my first time? 
 

 

 I'm wondering if I should go for a lesson first before driving with my mum. She was equally as anxious when driving with my sister, but I think she feels more comfortable each time. I don't take any medication for my anxiety, so I'm wanting some general advice.. I tend to overthink a lot and always imagine the worst case scenarios or worry about things that haven't even happened.

"I am 33 years old and I have now realised that the fear I have of being judged comes from my family environment. First of all, it is not something they did consciously and they are good people who have always wanted the best for me. But in my family it is very common to speak badly and criticise others. And after many years with anxiety which has worsened in the last 3 years I have realised that many of the fears I have about being judged come from what I have experienced at home.

"send me good vibes! I’m going to my first therapy appointment ever, it’s been a long time coming and I would LOVE to back out LOL - I won’t, but I’m so nervous. It feels extremely weird to just tell a stranger all my (what feels like) crazy reasons that I’m riddled with anxiety. I can’t help think they hear this all day, I’m just another a person that’s a job to them and no one really cares. My brain just tells me it’s pointless to go. But I won’t back out, just nervous."
"I work as a software developer, and there's this girl from another department where we meet in smoking areas ( we both smoke ), but don't talk. I spoke to her once saying something about smoking, a couple phrases then i ran out of words and it ended there. I noticed that everytime we pass each other by, we always lock eyes for a couple seconds, then its either me or her who turns away. I feel like by locking eyes so often, she's giving me a hint that she might be interested. Thing is,she doesn't know that i have an extreme fear of romantic relationships. My SA keeps telling me that i'll get rejected, and at work which is worse. It keeps telling me that i'm no match compared to the other guys that might have the courage to go up to her and talk. I have a million reasons not to talk to her ( first one is work, not a fan of workplace romance ), but I can't stop thinking about her, everytime she stares at me from a distance during breaks, i freeze obviously due to pressure from anxiety. I think by not taking it to the next level AKA talk to her, i'm making it weird. Am I making weird? I really like the girl at least physically, but holy shit, SA keeps playing mindgames with me.  
 

 

 Any advice is welcome."
"I (30M) have been diagnosed with GAD and have had it under control the last three or so years with medication and therapy. Two months ago, I had a flare up of anxiety likely caused by a lot of recent stressors (new baby, job change, job training period, etc.). 
 

 My psychiatrist upped my Cymbalta to 90mg recently and upped gabapentin (1200mg total in a day) to help. I feel like that has helped some. With my recent job role change, the company I work for wants me to relocate from my home town once I’m done with the training period in December.
 

 With the move, I would need to find a new counselor, new psychiatrist, and would be about 1000 miles away from any family or friends to help my wife with the newborn. I feel like all of this change during an anxiety flare up and a recent medication change would be a lot in affecting my recovery. It could just be my anxiety itself talking.
 

 I mentioned this to the company and tried to stay in my hometown, but they denied my request because I have received treatment for it, managed it well, and I can get similar treatment in the new location. I have thought about talking to them further about it but haven’t yet. I really enjoy this new job role and the company, but of course I want my mental health to be ok to be able to provide for my family.
 

 I guess my main fear is my anxiety flaring up again due to the move while having to adjust to a new location and being away from my current resources (family, psychiatrist, counselor, etc). Do you guys think I will be ok with this move?"
"Hey everyone, so i have social anxiety, an intense/bearable fear of public speaking, i can if i'm prepared recite whats on my paper and go away as fast as i can. i also have other issues in some other social situations. However, today was the day i didn't think myself capable of. I went to a theater class for the first time. I sweat like a pig for 20 minutes straight, 10 when waiting and 10 when the instructor was presenting the program. And then we did warmup, and from there on, it was a rollercoaster of emotions , each time, wondering when i'm gonna freeze and they all burst in laughter but it ended on a good note. No laughter was done at my expense.
 

 I know theater and social anxiety are not supposed to be compatible but i feel it can help me live situations that might be scary but in a controlled environment, you can live through it and not panic.
 

 Have a good night, peeps!

"I've always been skeptical of the legitimate benefits of vitamins, but it does seem like there's some evidence to suggest that vitamin B-complex, D, and magnesium can have benefits for mental health. Just curious what folks on here take and if they feel like it's worked or not worked for them?"
"One of the most frustrating parts of trying to deal with an anxiety disorder is getting the motivation and courage to actually act on making the smallest steps toward trying to get help. And then you have to trust that the people you go to will actually provide any meaningful help. If they don't, or you're expected then to take another step on your own, you're back at square one. 
 

 Obviously no one is going to hold your hand through life and no one owes you anything but it's an extremely difficult part of dealing with anxiety. That the person who is afraid and anxious is supposed to suppress it enough to seek and continue to seek help. Everything in my head is telling me not to make the call and that it can wait until tomorrow and then months go by. But I'm supposed to continuously gather strength to try and get help while in my experience, the help is usually not very helpful anyway. 
 

 I talked to the nurse at my doctor's office the other day and she told me she would email me some online resources for free therapy type things. Of course she didn't email me anything. It took me months to build up the will to even call my doctor and this is what I get. This is also not the first time doctors or therapists have told me they'd provide me something and don't follow through.
 

 Now I need to get the will to follow up again. And even if I get those resources I'll have to find the courage to even sign up for them or whatever. Which I probably won't or it will me a long time like everything does.
 

 It's just frustrating. Does anyone have any advice on how to find that courage or will? How to even get to the point of trusting anything that's supposed to be helping us?"
"I’m (F30) having some big issues right now. I need to perform well at work because I have agreed to finish projects and I can’t just drop them. 
 

 I’ve also have been having issues with my relationship. If I don’t start earning more money or do better in terms of my career, I think my partner is going to leave me. He has already compared me to his friends girlfriends and how they’re more successful and do better than me. And how I haven’t been working hard enough lately (my mental health has been in a bad place, I’ve been seeking therapy but it’s going to take time). 
 

 

 I think for me to feel that if I don’t perform better professionally, my partner is going to leave me is making me feel worse mentally. How can I suck it up and get my shit together? I feel a bit paralysed and feeling paralysed is making me feel worse. 
 

 

 Tdlr; mental health is interfering with my work and it’s stressing me out more because my partner will probably leave me over it. How can I get my shit together?"

It says it could change contract. i never heard or experienced something like this. They did tell me training is technically just ""2 days"". I noticed today while reading the contract.
 And on this same day of signing papers, they did ask me to start training for 3hrs. I said yes because i really want this job.
 

 

 While there i did fix my availability 2x, I'm now worried if i did it too much or if it could be misunderstood because i did say when it picks up, i will do more hours. For now..Its kind of short hours on Monday, Friday, and that i could only work 1 weekend day. I'm worried if that would rub them the wrong way. My boyfriend agrees but said positively, they wouldn't change their mind before the 2nd training if they gave me a uniform shirt and apron. I worry they would and I'd have to do a walk of shame to give it back lol 
 

 I'm also told that they'd call me back with my schedule. Which I was happily waiting until.. i saw this contract. I'm thinking they could just make it next week. But knowing how busy days are mid November too.. I'm getting too anxious. I just haven't been able to sleep since then and now stupidly looking over the stuff now. I'm so upset.
 

 I'm thinking of calling and asking about it. But I'm also unsure what to say because i am on high emotions. It has been only 2 days since then. But the contract date.. is that an error?
 

 Am I thinking too much and early? Should i call to ask? What kind of questions would you ask? I just can't find my words.
 

 

 UPDATE:
 i managed to confirm or had things clarified. The contract will be redone. It was an error on their end with the wrong end date month. And is still going through hiring, so i should expect a text tomorrow and a shift next week.
 

 My worries now are just normal hours stuff. It's a seasonal full time job. Ends early for now but store will extend its hours as seasons arrive. And despite they say at least 1 closing &amp; weekend day shift in the week, they seem iffy that those are also my requirements and that i could only do daytime on weekends. I did tell them my hours would also bw flexible to extend as seasons approach but yea.. its worrying."
"Hello,I am 32 and even though I will still carry SA and Depression all my life, it has gotten incredibly better and I’m currently living the best years of my life.Hard work though is never over and I continue to struggle to get better.
 

 I am writing this because I want to share my experience with dealing with social anxiety. Maybe it can help someone but I certainly do not think I have the perfect solution.I think that nothing beats going to see a mental health professional that can guide you and help you.I can only speak for myself and what seems to work for me.
 

 I will separate this text into two parts, **context** and **solution**, in case you just want to jump to the solution I found over the years.
 

 # Context
 

 I have struggled with social anxiety and depression my whole life, for as far as I can remember. By looking back I can clearly see patterns and events that made them worse and that I still carry inside me.
 

 My depression might be linked to my anxiety, but they are two separate things. I don’t get depressed because of my anxiety, they coexist inside me.
 

 I have lived very difficult times where I was at the bottom of the pit and when you are living through this, when you suffer every single minute, anything that can stop the pain even momentarily is considered, and that’s how I fell into multiple addictions.
 

 At some moments I couldn’t even look at people, couldn’t interact with them, and had a very hard time getting out of my room. The self hatred I felt was unbearable.  
 I longed for “peace”.
 

 Depression eventually got better, even though it returned many times, I learned how to handle it and stop it before it gets too strong, but that is not my point here.
 

 Even outside of the pit, talking to people has been extremely hard. Most of the time, when I had to interact with someone my brain went crazy, trying to find something to say, wanting to be liked and imagining every single negative thing the other person could think about me, constantly judging myself, during the conversation and of course after it, for hours, days or more.
 

 I know the fear of looking people in the eyes, of being stuck in an elevator with a neighbor, the nightmare of talking to a group, feeling mockery and judgment where there is none, suffering when there is some, the hesitation before opening the front door every morning, the hesitation before entering a room, rehearsing your greetings, the pain of blushing each time you are uncomfortable and seeing it in the eyes of the people you talk to, the pain of seeing unopened messages on your phone and dreading to click on them for weeks and sometimes months, the constant self judgment and so many other things, situations and fears...
 

 And all of this, I still feel it today. But something changed, I don’t suffer as much from all of this, I can talk to people, professionally and socially, I don’t judge myself as harshly as before. Every day I grow and I get better than the day before. I learn new skills and I can feel joy in my relations to others. I can meet new people and enjoy our conversations. I’m certainly not a very social person but it’s okay, I don’t need to be. All I want is to be able to enjoy life through relations, because I feel that our relations to other people can be one of the most beautiful and fulfilling things in life.
 

 # My personal solution
 

 Now about the way it got better.
 

 Let me start with this sentence from Rocky that resonates in me since I heard it:  
 “Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows. It’s a very mean and nasty place and I don’t care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain’t about how hard ya hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done""
 

 A person suffering from social anxiety and depression knows this well: life is pain. Either you do something, you get out there and you suffer, or you stay in, you hide and suffer. There is no way out from pain, there is no escaping it, either way you’re gonna feel it.
 

 So what can I do about it? If I can’t stop the pain, what do I do? What’s the purpose ?
 

 The fact is simple : I’m here and I need to make the best out of this life, because I cannot allow myself to fall deeper. No way I’m going back there. I need to find a way to survive and find some joy in life.
 

 If I can’t make pain it go away, maybe I can at least choose it. Maybe I can feel the pain I chose and not be a victim of the pain life throws at me.
 

 There is a sentence that marked me once : “If you choose the easy path, life is hard, if you choose the hard path, life gets easier”
 

 I decided one day that I would do anything I can to help myself. I would work hard, endure and grind in order to find some joy and happiness. And that’s what I did and in that process I discovered something incredible that I want to share with you all:
 

 **We can endure suffering**. We can endure it and go beyond it. Beyond pain, lie the most beautiful things in life. And that’s a truth for everyone, not only people suffering from depression or anxiety.
 

 The key word here is “**Courage**”.  
 What is courage ? Nelson Mandela said ""Courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.""
 

 When you suffer, you either run away from it or go beyond it. We stated that running away from pain does not stop it, so let’s try to go beyond it and see what happens.
 

 Most of my life I saw myself as a coward and acted as one. I was jealous of the people that seemed courageous. But now I understand that most of them were not courageous, they just felt a lot less pain than me.In order for us, socially anxious and depressed people, to do the same things that other people do, we need to endure a lot more pain, so in doing simple things, we already are more courageous than most people.
 

 Courage is cultivated through struggle. We struggle every day of our lives and anybody can develop the courage to endure the suffering that comes with social anxiety.
 

 When you develop courage and learn to endure pain, life gets easier, I assure you. It is my own experience that I can endure things I couldn’t imagine before, and while enduring them experience wonderful joys. And some pains get weaker and slowly fade away.
 

 Life is harsh, but it’s also so beautiful ! The feeling of a fresh wind on your face on a hot day while hiking in the mountains, the joy of helping a person in need, the sight of his smile, the indescriptible feeling of kissing the person you love for the first time (or just holding her hand), enjoying good times with close friends, playing board games, meeting new wonderful people… the list is infinite… And you can have all of this, I assure you.
 

 But for that, we need to develop more courage than the average person. We need to choose to feel some pain in order to get what we want from life.
 

 Now the question is ""**how do I develop courage ?**""There are plenty of resources on the internet and in books about this but I’ll give you my own experience.
 

 **Start with small things**. I think the most important thing is to prove to yourself that you are a courageous person. You already are, you just don’t know it.
 

 Start choosing the hard path when you can. I began with simple things like choosing to get in the elevator when a neighbor was inside it rather than taking the stairs, answering a simple call even though I was afraid to do it, asking a person in the street for directions, forcing myself to ask a colleague for more information about something, telling someone he is wrong. Every single day, you have infinite possibilities to show courage and do something you dread.
 

 But don’t just try to do hard things for the sake of it. Try to do hard things you want to do but are too afraid to. And be ready for failure my friend.
 

 I decided that my purpose was bigger than any pain coming from failure. I accept the pain that will come when I fail, because I am walking on a path.When you want to grow a muscle, you need to accept the pain and bring it to failure while training, it’s the same thing for my mind, I need to fail in order to get better.
 

 Be careful though, do not be too impatient. It takes time and gradually you can go from simple to more complex things. You don’t want to put yourself in situations you can’t handle at all. You need to learn your limits and play with them carefully. Be responsible.
 

 Many times I lost heart because I asked too much from myself and couldn’t deliver and it destroyed me. I had to learn to be patient with myself and to be gradual.
 

 And so one day something clicked in me. I have proved to myself that I could be courageous and choose the hard path and from that moment I began doing it more and more.
 

 Talking to people for example is still not easy but it has gotten incredibly easier than before.I started putting myself out there and I accepted the anxiety and the pain I felt : I was enduring this for a higher purpose. I met new people, talked more to colleagues, took classes, went out with people, tried to meet women through dating apps, failed a lot of times, enjoyed beautiful moments and I don't mind failure, because I see it all as training, as learning, as growing. The more you meet people, the more you put yourself out there and talk, the better it gets, you learn from your mistakes, you get more and more comfortable, you see that some things are far easier than you thought and you see that you are capable of incredible things.
 

 Things are far less painful than they are scary, and in my own experience fear is 99% of the time far worse than the actual event.
 

 I will give you some examples.
 

 I started standing up for myself at work, in front of colleagues or clients, and began voicing my opinions instead of staying silent.
 

 I found the courage to go see a psychologist and talk about my addictions. I reviewed my entire life with a pen and paper, and looking at your past can be quite unpleasant but I did it because I had to understand, it's important.
 

 Last year I decided I wanted to learn to ride a motorbike and in France it is hard, especially for an awkward, hesitant, fearful person like me. I was really terrorized by it, but I saw that I was courageous from all my previous experiences and I pushed myself into signing up. Man, what a year that was… it was hard but I finally got the sacred graal.
 

 And that proved to me that I could do anything I wanted, I could learn anything. If I could endure this and learn to ride a bike, what’s stopping me from learning or trying anything else?
 

 And so I continued: before I thought that music wasn’t for me, but I bought a guitar and started training, now I can play and sing some songs I love.  
 Lately I signed up for improvisation and salsa classes, because I want to learn to talk to people, enjoy dancing and socializing more. I’m terrorized, I’m awkward, I fail, but I don’t care anymore, I have a purpose.
 

 Yesterday, while I was walking towards my improv class, I was very anxious. I felt that big ball of pain in my stomach and so I told myself this :“I love you, and I’m doing this for you. I’m sorry for the pain but I’m going to feel this pain for you man, because you deserve to be happy and I will get you there, I promise.”
 

 **You need to be your biggest ally**. Nobody will care for you as much as you can care for yourself. Love yourself like a loving parent, make yourself go through hard things for your own sake. Reward yourself when you can.Most importantly, **be gradual**, know your limits, don’t ask too much from yourself too quickly.
 

 Your entire life lies on the other side of pain.
 

 I want to end this by saying that I really want you to find peace from all that pain. I know what you feel and I’m so sorry for you, so sorry I can’t stop it. I hope that this helps a little bit."
"My anxiety is so volatile, it's incredible. Everything has been going great lately, 2 minor incidents, and my anxiety peaked again. I don't remember the last time i felt this way in months. This is the problem with anxiety, it's unlike viruses or a headache. Sometimes you can't make it go away, it's persistent.
 

 It's a distorted view of the world that keeps triggering your fight or flight system. A world where, as a child, you can get beat up, sexually assaulted, mocked, humiliated, intimated etc.. No wonder we turned up this way. I haven't realized until lately the impacts of what happened to me during my childhood.
 

 I've been digging up with my therapist, and what an impact society has on the forming of the individual. I figured out that my anxiety is more situational than permanent fueled by sessions of ruminations and caused by genetic predisposition and traumas. My ruminations consists of a mode.
 

 A mode I enter subconciously the moment I get bored with something where I think of oscar-worthy ideas, scenarios of things that happened or about to happen in my life. With my inner voice, i do a monologue, mainly, describing whats happening in my imagination of what the thing ( whats about to happen ) would look like in my mind. And those images ,when I imagine them, trigger an adrenaline rush depending on the ""gravity"" of the image.
 

 Basically, whatever you're really afraid of because of traumas would happen in your imagination in those images. That's your mind trying to tell you, ""hey look, remember last time you were in that situation? RUN"". And those uneasy feelings will be more intense, the more you think of the situation.
 

 In some situations, lets say in my case a date, i could really get sick before going. no appetite, sweating, trembling, blushing easily, trouble breathing, you know the recipe. So it's annoying as fuck.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Anyway, that's how it works with me. Thank you for reading and if you feel down, know it's temporary. Feel free to share."
"My anxiety has been HIGH for about 20 hours because I realized I lost my ID after flying to another city and couldn’t calm down worrying about getting home. The whole ordeal getting through the airport the last 3 hours has been particularly bad. 
 

 I finally got through and noticed in the bathroom mirror one of my eyes is very bloodshot. I’m really hoping it’s from the anxiety because if I finally get home after all this and then have pink eye I’m going to have a mental breakdown."
"I'm (30F) getting so frustrated with myself lately.... I want to date and meet someone special but I feel like my anxiety is stopping me. I'm on countless apps and am pushing myself out of my comfort zone... but I feel like it's the never ending story of me attracting men that only want one thing only... I'm mad at myself because I'm one of the only friends who is still single, and I push myself out of my comfort zone to only get hurt again and again. Then of course I send myself into panic attack and then end up crying because I'm so annoyed at myself for having anxiety. Never ending! Ugh!"


"I'm 31F and started to take driving lessons over the summer on weekends. I grew up in the city so I had easy access to public transportation and my family did not have a car. Having moved to a suburb recently, I need to have a car now to get to places. 
 

 I must have taken 15 lessons at this point and failed my first test last week. The reason for failing was I saw a red light but there was also a green arrow to turn right, yet I stopped. I'm planning to retake the test soon but my confidence is down. Just took a lesson today and my instructor actually needed to guide me a lot more than usual. Not sure if it was just an off day.
 

 It just feels impossible at this point. Will I ever be a driver where my instructor doesn't need to guide me anymore? Shrug, it just feels so hard at this point"
"Life of mental health spending most of my time in bed breathing all day  going to bed really early cause sleeps the only time you get peace. scared to exercise, watch TV, play games because of how uncomfortable anxiety is and it gets worse trying to ignore it 😡🤬"
"I am currently sick with COVID-like symptoms (it is likely not COVID - I tested negative by rapid antigen and PCR on day 4 of symptoms) and have massive health anxiety. It worsened dramatically since early 2019 due to some unfortunate personal struggles, but is related to being a very sick child (adolescence full of needles, hospitals, and fevers so bad I needed ice baths). I didn't have any chronic illnesses except childhood asthma - just I suppose an unfortunate immune system and extreme bad luck.
 

 I'm 31 now and things had improved for so long. Last bad health year I was 19 and caught the trifecta of (in order) cholera, swine flu, and Coxsackie virus in a single year so most of my freshman year of college was sick and in the hospital :/ But since then I've not had more than a cold and my anxiety began to clear until 2019 and the pandemic. Getting COVID for the first time in May this year was a nightmare come to life. Now, I've got a second round of those symptoms and I am struggling against my anxiety and not rushing to the ER. Symptoms are mild, but the doctor said I have a virus and a slightly elevated CRP which has utterly spiraled me. Have ringing and pain and pressure in my ears as of today has made things very bad. I have a tendency to have hyper focus and hyper awareness and can be extremely psychosomatic due to this. I once managed to make my blood pressure reach literal cardiac arrest levels from thinking I was allergic to the first THC Gummi I've ever tried (reason number 1 I don't even drink - I skew towards paranoia). 
 

 Now I have not slept in 17 hours and am so tired, but every time I try to sleep my body jolts me awake and I feel like I can't breathe or my breathing stops. I think I am panicking now at going to sleep?! I have no idea where it's come from or why. I also get super hot when it happens and when I wake up and do something else it dissipates. Has anyone else experienced this?
 

 For people like me - how do you learn to separate what's in your head from reality or at least calm the panic? I convinced myself this was the virus again until a nice commenter pointed out it sounds like anxiety and I was like oh, yes, I have that. Therapy helped for a bit (a year maybe), but came back. I recently went to try to seek help again with a psychiatrist and just got berated multiple times and criticized for not speaking perfectly the language here (I live abroad) and told I need meds and she couldn't help someone like me (she was really mean). Now I am so traumatized by (how my brain interprets it) being told I am too messed up to help that I haven't tried to seek help again. I spent the last month missing work while getting every organ in my body scoped out by specialists (had a gastroscopy, echo cardiogram, even a freaking EEG where they measure brain waves) in an effort to find some mysterious illness. Did the same round in 2019. It's getting to be a lot :( I was on such an upswing before this and in the best health of my life, finally getting out of this country I landed in, interviewing for my dream job etc. And now I am here again waiting on a cytokine storm, unable to message my friends, and counting the days until my organs shut down - assuming it's 7-10 days as that's the average time period for that from covid because of course I Googled that 😭 I feel like a prisoner in my own mind somehow. I have friends with anxiety, but not to this level and it's so hard as I can't really talk about it to anyone, which is why therapy helped."
"I am 31 years old and have never officially been diagnosed with anxiety, which that's because I'm a person that when I got to the doctor for my yearly and they ask ""do you have any other concerns"" I throw on a smile and tell them I'm doing good and go abouty day. I feel like I will NEVER have the guts to admit that I may need help because I pushed the idea of anxiety down for so long. I'm pretty sure I've had minor anxiety since at least college, if not longer, and it is only getting worse. How do you work up the nerve to finally admit to a professional that you might need help? Even when I had a recent UTI I downplayed my symptoms just get in and out because I started to think I was being dramatic and didn't want to waste the medical staffs time (even though I was correct and definitely had a full blown infection). If I can't even admit to doctors when I have an extrinsic issue, how am I supposed to let my regular doctor know that I'm having issues? Even now I know I will look back on this post in a day or two and think to myself ""wow weren't you overreacting that night, suck it up and you'll be fine, it was one bad night,"" even though it is becoming a regular issue and has been for years."
"I've been experiencing debilitating anxiety with Nausea to the point of vomiting on and off for a little over 4 months now. 
 

 It all began when it was decided that I needed to move on from my place of employment of 5 years. Like many, because of Covid, I was working remotely from home for about 80% of my time put in for a little over a year. As an introvert, it's no surprise that this ended up working out very nicely for me. I was more efficient and focused in my work and the start to a healthy work life balance was finally on track. In the earlier part of 2022, my boss made the decision that everyone is to be back in office. I transitioned fine for the first couple of months, but I soon noticed that by being back in office it was easier for others in the office to pile their work onto me which in turn increased my workload and the in office environment also slowed down my productivity due to interruptions, excess meetings, yada yada. I pleaded with my boss to allow me the opportunity to work hybrid. At least 2 days at home with 3 days in office, and of course making myself available any time necessary for in person meetings. Ultimately my boss denied this request, stating that if I'm allowed special treatment then most others would desire the same, plus being the only one in office that's of a younger demographic, with the exception of 1 other new hire, I was needed in office to help support the (ungrateful) older demographic with PC &amp; software troubles. Mind you, I was offered no additional compensation for this extra help I brought to the table. This is beginning to turn into a novel about my experience with previous employer rather than the current issue at hand, my debiliting anxiety, so I'll attempt to wrap this portion up. The point is, I was never happy with my employment there as it was not a healthy work environment for many reasons, but the biggest always being that I was many often times forced into working excessive amounts of overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines which in turn, really effected me outside of work hours. 
 

 I made the decision to put in my notice, with no other jobs lined up, and my boyfriend wasn't working either, plus this was during the start of the inflation we're all experiencing now. I really did not want to get back into the industry I just exited. I tried applying to several other retail jobs which were a steep decrease in pay from what I was used to, but I was thinking my mental health was more important. I was even considering culinary school (so ironic seeing as I experience anxiety nausea) Then came along an offer from a dear friend about an opening at her place of employment, of course, just so happening to be in the same industry I just got out of. I stressed that I had a lot of reservations about getting back into the industry &amp; she herself understood this. She explained to me her experiences at this company versus the other, and the differences were night and day. She pressured me none in this, she just simply wanted to extend the opportunity as something to consider. The pay was doubled, if not close to tripled, plus the benefits were incredible and the company genuinely promotes a healthy work life balance for their employees. I talked to the hiring director and they were thrilled with my years in the industry and wanted me on board, with an offer to relocate. Relocating was a big deal for me. Especially with all that I was going through at the time. In talking with the hiring director I was adament that I had reservations getting back into the industry, detailing my past experiences, and they assured me that they would work with me to make certain I don't experience the same with them. With the stress of money issues, I figured I'd have to consider this new job in the same traumatic industry I just came out of. The worry of all this is what brought on the intense anxiety. I was experiencing loss of sleep &amp; loss of appetite like never before. I was easily agitated and of course all of this turned into many nights &amp; days of consistant anxiety with vomiting, even including an ER visit (the night before my on site visit to tour the new workplace) that was so extreme they had to inject me with ativan as no other remedy was working at the time. My boyfriend was there with me through it all which was the greatest help.
 

 I eventually accepted the job offer and this new company yet in the same industry, but instead of having to permanently relocate, I could actually work entirely from home, with the exception of about 4 days of my choice in office each month. The drive is only about 2 hours out, so really not too bad, plus the reimbursement for the travel time &amp; accommodation is well worth it. Definitely a sign that this company is really working with me here. I can't stress to you how night and day working at this company has actually been. I am taken care of, sometimes to a point where I feel like I slightly taken advantage of their benefits without really being an asset yet. I've been working with the company for almost 4 months now, and it's overall been a great experience. Within the first couple months I did have a breakdown and attempted to put in my notice, but my manager kindly talked me out of it, stressing that they'd pump the brakes even more if need be, just so I can get better adjusted. I mean, what other companies do that? This is my first experience in working for a very successful company so this treatment feels very foreign, still welcomed of course. I'm trying my absolute hardest to make this work, as i know its whats best for me right now. 
 

 To provide just a touch more background, I love the work that I do, but through my experiences, I've found I do want to experience other ventures. (Really, first world problems it sounds like here) I'm 30 years old now and I feel like I'm running out of time &amp; I need to solidify my choices and begin working towards them. No matter what company I work for in the industy I'm currently in, the job is very demanding. Yes, I do have a healthy worklife balance, but ultimately, I want to experience more. Something more ""me"" which through of of this, I'm still trying to figure myself out a little more. I've been very dependent on my boyfriend. He's the only person I have in my life actually. I do have family, but my boyfriend understands me so much better. He's going through his own very intense troubles now, and as anybody with depression knows, it's not healthy for either recipient to ""dump"" their problems onto them, as it actually worsens depressive symptoms. I can't help but to realize that my episodes cause his episodes. When I travel for work, I need him along with me for support, but bringing him along actually causes him a lot of turmoil (as for the reasons as to why, too much to get into) this current episode is actually brought on for this very reason, I attempted to travel for work on my own this time, but I bailed out, and confided in him that I do need him there with me. This of course, is something that he's upset by &amp; just exhausted with, understandably. 
 

 My life still feels very uncertain, and my anxiety with vomiting still occurs, as of right now actually, that's why I'm here typing this up. I'm at a point in my life where every little change, good or bad, ignites an episode. I need to be independent but everytime I try, I tailspin into an episode. The vomiting is just so bad and debilitating. I've always been very skinny, I'm 30 years old and at my best I've only ever weighed 105 lbs. In the early stages of my episodes I dropped to 94 lbs. I'm now back to 98 lbs, with the help of ensure and eating many lighter foods throughout the days. I take ondensetren, vistiril, dramimine, and other remedies to help cope with the attacks. I am no-good with antidepressants and such. I got prescribed mirtazapine, at a low dosage, but I've yet to take it because of the sleepiness side effect. Yes, I need sleep, but I don't want to feel groggy throughout the day. My work will be greatly effected by that. Mirtazapine I hear is good for appetite, which I would benefit from. I'm looking into therapy now, maybe that'll help? 
 

 If anyone has any additional suggestions, I'd very much love to hear them as I'm running out of ideas."
"I just got diagnosed with mild mitral valve and aortic regurgitation. I'm 32. I sometimes wake up with a numbing left arm and a resting hr that shoots up to 115-125 bpm, but oxygen level is normal. Been having chest tightness as well. Also, I sometimes feel dizzy that I feel like the ground is moving or I'm floating. I also feel like there is a lump/discomfort in my throat and it's hard to swallow. I have tingling sensation all over my body. There are times I would have severe headaches accompanied by blurry vision. Usually when these happen at night, I cannot sleep anymore till the morning because I feel like I won't wake up anymore. It's hard for me to identify whether my chest pain episode is from my heart, asthma, or anxiety. It's frustrating because I have been told my condition doesn't usually exhibit symptoms but here I am physically struggling everyday 😔 They said it could be psychological. I was already referred to a psychiatrist but I'm scared and worried that this might be an undetected cardiac problem. Do you guys also experience these things when you are having anxiety episodes? I don't know what to do."
"Me(33f) and my fiancé (34m) have been together for 4 1/2 years. I have been open about my anxiety from the beginning while he has not.
 

 This year I have really caught on to how much of a hypochondriac he really is.
 We had been together for almost a year when covid hit. He went way over the top with. Every time he got a cold he shut himself away and acted like he was going to die. After 3 more years of observing him I see how bad his anxiety is.
 

 He was/is a smoker, and would keep trying to quit and during each withdrawal stage he would freak out about his symptoms. Any time I suggested he was withdrawing he would get SO MAD. For the next two years, he would start smoking again and suddenly quit, display the same symptoms, freak out that he is dying and get mad about me suggesting he was triggering a withdrawal. The worst is the chest pains you feel after you stop smoking. He gets mad at me for not taking it seriously but it gets hard to when I’ve watched him go through the motions of withdrawing only to get addicted again and withdraw again. 
 

 He also has severe allergies, this is real and documented. He doesn’t take any allergies medicines and freaks out when he has allergy symptoms. When I remind him that he has allergies he flips out on me for not being concerned for him.
 

 Now he has been having, what he claims is, severe throat pain. He is going to the doctor but he’s freaking out. He yells at me every time I suggest it might not be cancer. He’s sulking around the house and being very doom and gloom. 
 

 Part of me is very worried that he does have throat cancer but the other part of me is so tired of the constant melodramatic displays for EVERY ailment.
 

 If I did not know any better I would be so worried for him but now I’m just like when is this behavior going to end?!
 

 His anxiety is triggering my anxiety!"
"My mother called me tonight and advised me that my estranged alcoholic father has been missing for at least 24 hours, and there is thoughts he may have attempted to take his life.
 

 This is another classic example of me doing my best to live my life without this toxic person only for the phone to ring and get sucked back into chaos.
 

 He recently told my brother who is still in contact with him that he has stage 4 cancer and only has 12 months to live.
 

 However since then it appears that my mother, my aunt (his sister) and my brother now believe that he was lying so could have an opportunity for my brother to let him live with him, his wife and child.
 

 The valium has kicked in and I no longer feel sick to my stomach. I can honestly see how people get addicted to this stuff but considering the circumstances the once off is the better alternative to the full blown panic attack I could feel coming.
 

 I contacted my boss and advised what has happened and that I won't be at work tomorrow. 
 

 I need time to decompress and take care of myself. I don't even know where to start."
"Back story: Few months ago.. i went back to work after 6yrs. It was the worst and stressful job of my life. It honestly triggered alot of things for me. My agoraphobic tendencies came back harder. Panic attacks are more frequent. But we're in big need of $$ because of my health. My bf and I got an idea of going for seasonal jobs because when it's over, i could take long breaks as i want. And maybe it be a great start before going full into.
 

 The job begins tomorrow &amp; Wednesday. Two 4hr shifts. Not bad. I'm just worried because i never wrapped in years and my speaking ability.. its just my brain has stopped functioning well after all these years. So I'm struggling with my anxiety to remember and process but it won't. I think i forgot how holiday season is... the rush is.. eek.
 

 My main problem causing huge anxiety is that I been stuck on hours and availability. It is a seasonal full time position. they open at 10-7pm but will close at 9pm eventually as we approach Christmas.They want someone flexible that could work 8hrs, could do at least 1 weekend day and 1 closing. Idk if every shift will be or must be 8hrs and an everyday kind of job.They say they're also flexible to match our availability not the vibe I'm getting. I hope I'm wrong. They did say, shift making/posting is every weeks. So there's time to ""change"".
 

 Tbh i kinda could do just that, 3 closings on weekdays max with 1 weekend day but only up to 4pm. I feel like i made them iffy because of that. I changed it twice already but they also seem desperate. And i been stuck a week thinking bout it since then. So far they are messy in hiring. I have to redo contract because they put wrong date and interview was weird.. and even on day i came to sign, i started training for 3 hrs. So idk or think that's ""normal"" lol but i am in my yesman state.
 

 Because of my anxiety and being on bring of panic. I made it half days and 1 weekend day for self care time and errand time.
 

 We are quickly approaching November and end of contract is Christmas. I'm unsure to just change my availability to all weekday &amp; 1 weekend day only (no closing and only until 3:30 or 4).
 I just don't know what to do because it is great at current closing hours. If it is 7pm, i could do, but when the store will be extended to 9pm. I'm just so scared. That's why I'm thinking to just keep originally but i worry with my little brain, I'll be first to go.
 

 Should i just keep as is or change to the 2nd plan(all time availability on weekdays to close but keeping 1 no closing/short shift weekend day)? Or original plan but change to second when they get busier.
 

 

 I need help guys, I'm struggling to think or process. I'm on the brink of an attack. I just feel super bad. Am i being too picky for someone who wants/needs this job?"
"I made a post here a couple of weeks back saying that he had come back into our lives.
 

 I have cancelled contact with him since I believe 2020.
 

 The amount of hurt he has caused me and my family over the years due to alcohol abuse is staggering and this is just icing on the cake.
 

 All the chances the was given to get help.
 All the support we gave him.
 He's chose the fucking bottle everytime.
 

 He would rather write a suicide note blaming my mother for all of his own actions instead of owning up like a fucking man.
 

 At first I felt panic, then I felt nausea and now I feel anger. 
 

 The only positive to come out of this is that his toxicity can hopefully no longer continue and we can finally have a family.
 

 His legacy is my anxiety and nightmares.
 

 The last time we spoke he tried to gaslight me for calling him out on striking my mother when I was young. 
 

 The last thing I said to him was ""good riddance, you have fucking rot on the brain""
 

 I feel like I want to smash things"
"I've done theater class for beginners twice now, and before/during i sweat so much compared to the other students its incredible. I manage not to throw in a panic attack when playing scenes ( simple ones ) but i get scared a lot doing theater so far. After each session, i feel so anxious the next 3 days, holy shit, i can't concentrate on work, i sweat all day, i wake up with this chest pain ( the same pain you feel in your heart when you do physical effort ) . Workout seems to ease off the anxiety. But the feeling itself that i felt today, what a horrible thing to live through. I wish it upon no one. I kinda feel better now. Maybe if i keep at it, the anxiety will eventually go to a manageable level."
"I had a near choking incident almost 2 years ago and I feel like I have PTSD from it to this day .
 I was just sitting in my room home alone eating some boneless chicken, and I remember chewing and then taking a big gulp of Gatorade to wash it down, and suddenly I couldn't breathe in or out 
 

 I ran outside and I was pounding on my chest trying to do the self Heimlich 
 I thought for certain that I was going to die right then and there, but suddenly I was able to start breathing again.
 I don't remember hacking up any food so I don't even know if I was really choking.
 Maybe I had a sudden onset severe panic attack
 But I just don't know
 I still worry about choking way too much and I just can't get the thoughts out of my head.
 I can't afford a psychiatrist and I have no insurance 
 I get Zoloft for free and only take 25 mg which has stopped my panic attacks
  But I still deal with tons of anxiousness and thought patterns that just won't stop.
 I really just want to know how to move past these worry thoughts"
"Has anyone experienced this? I felt it in my lower left throat for the first time this morning and it scared the mess out of me. I looked it up, and it says it's normal. I've just never experienced this in my life."
I am terrified a spot on my skin is melanoma. Google says it is. I can’t stop panicking I don’t know what to do.
"Wooooow fuck the past 24 hours! (first time poster, joining after probably) I think I'm going to name this asshole living in my head. Il give it a few days so I'm going to start with Miller. Would explain the changes I've made to my hair style and my newer mannerisms. (See Detective Miller from the Expanse series) 
 

 Without Spoiling much Miller has a way of getting into your head. His character played by Thomas Jane is portrayed so well in the show in my opinion because of how he showcases many of Miller's own anxieties and fixations. I am new to all of this, and in the past year it has gotten so much harder to come back to reality. 
 

 Miller moved in sometime after I met my father for the first time in 31 years. Great experience meeting him, coming back from the trip it was like the flood gates had been opened and all these self realizations just came gushing out all at once. My family is struggling financially, we are a single income household. I(32M) work as a newly promoted Assistant Manager, pushed through Miller's nonsense this whole last year to get here. My wife would help but she had to stop working due to chronic migraines that have essentially turned her into a Vampire as she does love to joke about. She used to make bank enough for me to stay home with our child so that I could work on my school but after getting the house and then the migraines I had to go back making less than half of what she was. It's at half now, so essentially I'm making less due to inflation. 
 

 I think Miller might have been what got me through the worst of it and now he can stop chasing ghosts while the objective has changed. He so often interrupts me at work, and prevents me from getting adequate rest. Always checking those corners and doors!! Wednesdays are my day off and the whole last 24 hours were stolen from me by Miller. He gets so focused on my wife not having a good day, the LGM to our location being fired/quit/wteva, my son and pets for impeding his investigations into whatever the hell is triggering me. 
 

 I am so sick of him and his poking around. If I had a Trilby Hat I'd wear it to ""Keep the Rain off my (our) head."" (I'm going to actually buy one now as I write this it makes so much sense.) Seriously though, now it's 4:39 and I'm still hesitant to go get ready for bed. I gotta be up in 2 hours but I can't seem to ""remind myself of who I am so I can come back."" Now that one was Jim. Yeah, I gotta be careful with these personas. Although, I gotta admit the idea of just giving Miller control so I can just let whatever happens happen does sound relieving in a way. Just let go for a bit and let Miller do some of the driving. Maybe then, I can navigate my way through the ring and come out the other side with some new tools? Or maybe the room will eat me for going in too fast...fuck it for two hours of sleep I'm just going to shower in an hour and head into work early.
 

 Note: Sorry for any typos, it is 5 am after all!"
"I've been having moments of intense panic since I started going into university after the pandemic but I don't know whether my symptoms are considered a panic attack. It seems like if I had a panic attack it would be unmistakable, but my symptoms don't last longer than 5 minutes.
 

 Today was my worst one. I was sitting in the middle of a very long row of seats in the lecture hall and I was sandwiched between other students and unable to leave the room easily because of the space. I took the risk by choosing to sit there and I knew it was a bad idea. 
 

 Suddenly my mind starts racing and I can feel this build up of intense fear and I'm trying to fight it but it's impossible at this point. I feel dizzy and my face gets really hot, and my heart starts thumping so hard and fast that I feel like it might explode. All I can think about is how completely out of control I feel and how much it terrifies me. I'm really dissociating at this point and I want to leave the room but I stay because of the fear of drawing attention to myself and making everyone move for me. When it eventually subsides my whole body is trembling, hands especially, and I slowly feel myself return to reality. I spend the next 45 mins trying to suppress the same symptoms which keep threatening to bubble up and start the whole cycle again. It feels like I'm fighting constantly to maintain control.
 

 The reason it seems different to the panic attacks I've read about is because I don't have shortness of breath and I don't hyperventilate. I also don't feel like I'm going to die, just that I've totally lost control. That's why I've been calling them anxiety attacks and not panic attacks. This one totally ruined the rest of my day though, and I've felt nauseous, irritable and anxious ever since.
 

 I'm phoning the doctor tomorrow and would like to know if I can accurately describe it as a panic attack, or if it's severe anxiety. Any help is greatly appreciated. :)"
"Hi Sweeties,
 

 I am usually pretty good friends with my anxiety, even if it's taken some accommodation. I walk twelve miles a day listening to romance novels, smoke weed (ymmv), and meditate regularly.
 

 However, I've got COVID and I can't do . . . Any of those right now, which is making this entire thing pretty difficult. Can't exercise, can't smoke, my raspy breathing is making it hard to meditate and I can't settle enough to listen to a novel rn. 
 

 If anyone has any other anxiety control recommendations I am all ears.
 

 Thanks sweeties."
"I (30F) have been managing various types of projects (from videos, web development, graphic design etc) for about 6 years now for work, and I find I always get major heart palpitating, body squeezing feelings, stomach ache and tight shoulders every time I:
 

 - make a mistake with the project and confronting
 - have to explain cost requests
 - anything that feels like we're going off plan..
 

 I have a hard time distancing the emotional side of making mistakes and side tracking from plans.. and I often feel my first thought when a mistake happens is 'aack im so stupid im sorry dear client i missed this', even when in reality i could be tracing the real source of the problem, but as a PM I felt I'm the face of our company and always feel this deep need to apologize..
 

 I mean, on the outside, I honestly seem fine and just passing messages, but on the inside my heart feels weirdly crushed and I often feel like I'm about to get sick with a stomach ache -- I find my level of anxiety is increasing rather than decreasing even if I've handled like 3 to 4 big projects every year.. but really what keeps me going is the benefit our projects give and just try my best again.
 

 I also do sales presentarions every once in a while and I have this knee jerk reaction to always need to keep the client happy even if it means bending our rules a bit and it gets me in trouble..
 

 I enjoy my work, and I honestly just want to overcome these feelings, I didnt realize it would be this difficult though
 

 ... I'm seeking therapy for sure, but thought to ask here if there are helpful things to try to manage the anxiety or prepare for these triggers as a project manager?"
"Hi everyone, I’ve had debilitating anxiety most of my life starting around 12. I’m 32 now. We’ve tried several different medications including lexapro, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, buspar, viibryd, and benzos like alprazolam and clonazepam. Zoloft was my first antidepressant that I tried at 22 years old and it actually significantly helped for the first year. Then after that, it seemed like my brain changed and Zoloft was making my symptoms really bad. I discontinued and for the past 10 years have sought out so many different kinds of help and meds to no avail. Most serotonin-increasing substances cause me mild serotonin syndrome symptoms, even at low doses and after several weeks. I will basically have insomnia for 2 or 3 days straight just from a single low dose of any SSRI or serotonin agonist. My brain has changed either from trauma or previous antidepressant use.
 

 I know my official diagnoses are GAD, social anxiety, depression, and panic disorder. I’m currently taking trazodone because insomnia was such a big symptom for me; however, trazodone does not help with my anxiety and barely helps with my depression. Sadly, it is the only antidepressant I’ve tried that doesn’t give me side effects other than drowsiness so I’m just sticking with it despite it not actually helping anything other than sleep. THC can be a game changer for me but not when my tolerance builds up. It seems my brain is non-responsive or minimally responsive to benzos now, and of course I can’t increase and don’t want to increase my dose.
 

 Anyone know the next steps I should take with my doctor? I would’ve expected him to refer me to a psychiatrist (I’ve been before but it has been about a decade) or a psychologist for a new evaluation. A brain MRI would be nice but I feel like no matter how bad my symptoms are, those kinds of tests seem off limits whether because of insurance or my doctor not realizing the severity of my symptoms. Do people really trial 20+ medications over decades and still have just as bad anxiety as when they started, or is there supposed to be some kind of pipeline that I should’ve been moved through already by now to see neuroscientists, looking into rTMS or other treatments. I just feel mismanaged and my career and health are now damaged because of it. I used to be really high functioning (I was in a PhD in mathematics) and then I entered into a severe depression with severe anxiety that never went away which was around 5 years ago.
 

 I am as healthy as I can possibly be with both diet and exercise. I’m at the gym 5x a week, I sleep 8-9 hours, I get my calories, protein, veggies, healthy fats, etc. I don’t know what is wrong with me or what I can do differently. It’s like nothing helps at all. Right now, my heart rate is elevated even though I’m chilling in bed, I’m sweating, and restless. Why? I have nothing in my mind that I’m worried about. It’s just autonomic bullshit and I’m sick of it."
"I (f31) have some big exciting life changes coming up. My wife and I are moving countries from the UK to Canada for multiple reasons. Anyways, I am a teacher and I am preparing to give my notice to work very soon. I feel such dread about quitting. I am overthinking it, but I’m afraid people will be upset with me that I didn’t tell them sooner, especially the pals I have made at work. I’m nervous that my head teacher will be upset that I am leaving halfway through the academic year. I really can’t stand having people talk about me and being the centre of attention. I don’t know why I am getting so worked up about it all. My job isn’t my life and people quit jobs all the time, but I’m so afraid of upsetting people. I have gotten to the point where I feel sick about it all."
"You were the man that raised me.
 You were the man that didn’t have to.
 You took it upon yourself to raise a child that wasn’t yours. 
 You may be part of the reason why I stand up for what I feel is right.
 You may be part of the reason why I think outside of the box.
 You may be part of the reason why I don’t give up when times are tough.
 

 You were the person who I looked up to when I was young.
 You were the person who I used to respect.
 

 I remember you telling me what your tattoos meant. 
 The jaguar was what you wanted to be when you were young – strong, fierce, protective.
 The Indian Warrior is what you wanted to be when you were old – Wise and noble.
 

 When I was a child, I thought of you as the jaguar.
 

 I thought you were strong. 
 I thought you were fierce. 
 I saw you as a protector.
 

 However now that I am an adult, I know in my heart that you never lived up to your own expectations, and I think you knew that too.
 

 You weren’t strong.
 You weren’t a protector.
 You weren’t noble.
 

 My mother needed protecting from you. 
 We needed protecting from you.
 We just didn't know it then.
 

 Looking back on my childhood, I thought that was how families were like – didn’t most dad’s drink? Don’t most nine-year-old’s know they’re dads’ favorite brand of beer and cigarettes?
 

 I thought that’s just how you were - don’t most dads not want to be part of social events? Don't most husbands forget their wedding anniversaries and wives birthdays? He doesn’t need many friends, he has us.
 

 You may have been different from other dads, but you were you. - it’s OK, he’s always been like that – he’s just different. You don’t know him like I do.
 

 Now as an adult I know better.
 

 I used to want to be like you because I thought you were what a man should be. 
 Now as a man, I know deep in my heart that I never will be like you.
 I will never treat the women I love like you did my mother.
 I will never manipulate my children or others like you did.
 I will never choose a substance over people I have the responsibility to protect.
 

 Because that’s what people with integrity do.
 

 I’ve seen what good dads are like – they don’t leave their 5 year and 2-year-old kids unattended in hotel rooms to go drinking.
 I’ve seen what good husbands are like – they don’t gaslight or beat their wives. They support and encourage their wives; they don’t put them down.
 I’ve seen what good people are like – they don’t drink drive and they don’t fracture other people's skulls just because their feelings were hurt.
 

 You once told me that you knew you werent a good husband, but you were OK with that as long as you thought you were a good father. 
 

 As your son, I shouldn’t have had to tell you that you can’t be one without being the other. 
 

 I wasn’t willing to look past it when I cut contact with you and I won’t look past it now.
 

 Good dads don’t manipulate their children against their mother to make them think she is crazy, when it’s his fault she is depressed.
 Good husbands don’t hit their wives behind closed doors and tell their kids to cover it up.
 Good people don’t kill themselves and blame their wives that they abused.
 

 I was there when you said you wanted the divorce.
 I was there when you made jokes about leaving her in front of us.
 I was there when you told her you never loved her.
 

 I know you heard me telling her to leave you.
 I know you heard me telling her you didn’t deserve her.
 I meant it then and I mean it now. 
 

 She was the glue that held our family together.
 You became the toxicity that you so often had in your bloodstream.
 

 Even with the note you left
 Even with the lies you told
 Even with the people that believed you
 

 You and I both know the truth. 
 I was there. 
 We were there.
 They weren’t.
 

 They didn’t see the real side of you like we did.
 

 Everyone can try and look the other way.
 They can pretend it didn’t happen.
 They can say you weren’t perfect, but you had a good heart.
 They can listen to your lies and blame the people that didn’t deserve it.
 

 But you and I both know that it is wrong. 
 Because I was there and I witnessed it.
 

 Even when I called you out on it as an adult and you tried to gaslight me like you did her.
 Even when I held my ground and you refused to own up to it.
 

 Good men stand up to their toxic fathers, even if it hurts.
 Good men don’t continue the cycle of abuse, even if they struggle with mental health
 Good men don’t destroy their families, they protect them.
 

 You will never be the jaguar or the chief to me.
 

 I will not go to your service.
 I will never pretend you were a good person.
 I will never justify your behavior because of your mental health.
 I will never forgive you.
 

 Don’t pretend you didn’t have the opportunity to get help.
 Everyone knows how much it was there to be to be taken. 
 But instead of accepting it or taking responsibility, you chose to drink, time and time again.
 

 Even now that you have left this world, you still cause hurt within our family.
 Your lies continue to turn people against each other.
 Because they didn’t know you like we did.
 They couldn’t see through the facade like I did.
 They weren’t there like I was and they didn’t know that they were victims like my mother, my brother and I were.
 

 I don’t share this to slander you, because it’s the truth. 
 

 I don’t even have to say your name. Because they all know who I am speaking about.
 

 I don’t share this to hurt the people I care about, because they have the right to know the person you really were. Even if they don’t want to admit it.
 

 I do this for my own closure. Because you were too cowardly to apologize for any of it.
 

 I do this because you were never held accountable to your actions and because the world deserves to know.
 

 I do this because even in the end, you chose to end your life instead of apologizing for:
 

 Being cruel to animals in front of me.
 

 For neglecting house work or learning how to cook a decent meal for your kids because you were too busy drinking.
 

 For not being a part of your own personal finances and blaming my mother because you pissed your money away.
 

 For telling me I wasn’t your biological son in the middle of an argument with my mother, just to spite her.
 

 For nearly killing your neighbor.
 

 For getting my brother fired from his job out of spite.
 

 For drink driving.
 

 For trying to get my to buy you alchohol and cigarettes even though I was underage and didn't want to.
 

 For teaching me to hate my grandfather before he died because of your personal vendetta against him.
 

 For telling me not to visit my brother in hospital even though he had just been in a car crash.
 

 For going against the very morals you taught me as a child.
 

 For never teaching us how to handle life’s problems by being assertive.
 

 For bringing your alcoholism into my brother’s home in front of his wife and my god daughter.
 

 For stopping my mother from moving on from you when all she did was help you.
 

 For killing yourself and blaming her.
 

 You burned every bridge you had left, and the only reason you had any to burn in the first place was because there are people in the world that are better than you were.
 

 If there really is an afterlife, I can only hope that you are now finally judged. 
 

 If there really is a heaven, you don't deserve to be there.
 

 The hurt may sting us now, but eventually it will subside, just like my memories of you.
 

 Jaguars may be strong. Warriors may be wise. 
 

 And you were neither. 
 

 We both know in the end you were weak, both in body in mind.
  
 And it’s all your fault.
 

 None of us deserved what you put us through. 
 

 You were never the victim, we were.
 

 But now that you are gone.
  
 We won’t be victims any longer.
 

 I will live my life in spite of you.
 

 I will overcome the anxiety, the panic attacks, the nightmares in spite of you.
 

 I will succeed in life in spite of you.
 

 I will protect my family, because that’s what good people do. 
 

 Not like you."
"I'm M31 but I have no career, no friends, no dating experience, nor anything that I should've figured out by my age. I think I have GAD. So I doubt every choice I make, so I default to nothingness, all the while time ticks away. How do I get unstuck when I get so anxious about each decision?"
"I know it takes time to find the right one. I'm struggling because when I was in middle school and my mom noticed something was wrong, I was put on Zoloft and it fixed everything. My anxiety and depression suddenly wasn't the worst thing in my life. Now here I am, 20 years later, back at square one because the zoloft doesn't work anymore. Here I am back at square one because the first med I tried in 20 years didn't do anything. Here I am back at square one because the next several meds after that didn't do anything. The only med that has helped is gabapentin and I'm taking it 3x a day because it has such a short half life. 
 

 I had therapy the other day and I was so anxious my therapist was surprised. We did a body scanning exercise and it only made my anxiety worse because I couldn't stop my thoughts. I couldn't turn off my brain. 
 

 I saw a psychiatrist for the first time ever and I mentioned I had misophonia and he asked me (very kindly) what noises upset me and I felt like a crazy person. 
 

 I'm starting on Lexapro and I really need this one to work. I need it to shut off my brain and give me back my life. I feel like I'm running out of hope. Destined to be one of the patients I see in my own ER because they don't know what else to do. I don't want to be that person but my future is looking worse and worse."
"I read lately about something called Chronic Lateness, and i was like : is that a thing? because all my life i've went late to meeting with friends, classes even work. And I can't explain it. I tried to explain it with anxiety. It would be because i hate smalltalk so much, that i come late to avoid it. I don't know.The post about chronic lateness being a symptom of ADD made think about it.
 

 I eat my fingernails, I have restless leg syndrome, my head is going to explode with crazy ideas that I can almost never verbalize. When I do something with passion, i go in an adrenaline mode, some kind of flow, coding for example in my case. Nothing else matters except doing that thing. You kinda forget about everything around you. Some addicting behavior stuff.
 

 What does Reddit think?"
"Though its hard to be optimistic I will continue to stay hopeful for my future.. its the only way. I was invited to two Halloween parties tonight.. one at my friends house and the other at a bar. Ive never been big into dressing up but I was thinking of choosing one and show up. I had plans of that this morning but as the day went on the anxiety started creeping in.. then I deceided I'm gunna skip the parties, go hit my Moms hot tub, come home and nap, then go out to catch a late night set from a dj that was in town that a few of my friends were at.
 

 I ended up staying at my Moms a little late and I came straight home to eat in bed and watch Netflix.. didn't do a dam thing I wanted. Ive come to learn that going out and dealing with the anticipatory anxiety beforehand is not as bad as letting it get to me and staying home with guilt for not doing it but sometimes you just lose the battle of the day. All you can do is strap up and do your best tomorrow.
 

 Although I'm forever optimistic, it still sucks to lose that battle.. I fear each time you do, it gets a little bit easier to let it happen the next time and that scares me to think about for my future..
 

 Felt good to share my thoughts on this..Thanks for reading and much love."
"Hello all, I am new to this sub and I wanted to ask for some tips/advice on how you guys cope with social anxiety.
 

 A bit of back story, i am 30 and a male, I have always been confident and have no issue with facing challenges in my life with work or family etc. That was until I had my son 6 years ago. When my son was born he had a stroke and he has been left with cerebral palsy, and other disabilities (don’t know if this is why it started). 
 

 Since then randomly I seem to get very anxious when I know I have an event to go to. I get a nervous tummy before and I overthink things. I always force myself to go to for my wife and to make sure I don’t take a step backwards. Then when I am out I start to have heart palpitations, start sweating and feeling dizzy and nauseous. 
 

 What advice can you give me to help deal with this before and during the event to help or completely stop it happening? 
 

 Sorry about the long post, just unsure of what I can do to stop this happening so I can start enjoying occasions again."
"I (29m) don't know if this is where I should place this, but I am in a bit of an emotional pickle. 
 

 This woman I've known for years (30f) got married recently. A lot of people are saying she and her new husband look really happy together and it doesn't look like they will split anytime soon if ever. However, I know how this person is. She claims to be right most of the time and is treating this marriage like the happily ever after of a fairy tale, wanting to be a mother and being around friends that got married. In fact, her two bridesmaids got married right around the same time she did (1 a month before and the other just a few days before her wedding). So yes, visually this does seem like a wonderful, if not bizarre, dream come true. 
 

 However, my friend, like me, is also on the Autism spectrum, and her anxiety and depression are much more severe than mine. When she posted on Instagram and Twitter about her wedding, she only mentioned the man that she loved once, making it more about how she could now say that she is a married woman after she feared her day would never come, and that now she could go on triple dates with her friends. I know some of you would see this as wonderful, but to me this screams trouble in paradise is coming for them, probably within the new year if not sooner. But when I tell people this, they either say that I need to let it go, or to just be happy for her like the friend that I am. I can't though. 
 

 I know a lot of people view marriage as sacred, but there was so much divorce in my family history on both sides. My mom and dad, as well as my aunts and uncles, all ended up in second marriages or new relationships when I was a child. Even my maternal grandparents got divorced. However my paternal grandparents and paternal great grandparents stayed married. But those are exceptions to the majority I was familiar with. My cousin got divorced, which makes me worried about my other cousin and myself. This kind of puts me at a mental state where even though marriage is sacred, it doesn't always last, and sometimes you have to be prepared for that. 
 

 Which brings me back to my friend. Her mom and dad both married multiple times before staying with each other in marriage. In fact her mother was married TWICE! 
 But her grandparents stayed together forever, and because they were such an influence on her life she got married at their church and got a dress similar to her grandmother. She emulated that experience for herself. I'm worried she is heading for disaster. You know how soon she got engaged? Only four months after meeting the guy, and one month of being in a relationship with him. It may sound like heaven to some people but for me that is just NUTS! Hell, with how fast he proposed, her now husband sounds nuts too!
 

 I openly told her about this and how she was not marrying the guy out of love. Too much? Maybe. She did block me for an hour on social media before unblocking me. I told her again, the day before the wedding, about my concerns. She said nothing but I didn congratulate her and all that like one is supposed to even though I felt divorce was extremely inevitable. We still chat and remain good friends if not best friends, but what people have told me and how they treat marriage is still weighing kn my mind.
 

 With all this said, I don't know if this was a vent or not, but I feel I had to get it off of my chest. What are your thoughts about how I should handle people telling me what to think and how I can better communicate my views without starting arguments?"
"I think of myself as a loving person sometimes even in excess. But with social anxiety, i just can't act calmly in vulnerable situations where i would have to do an act of love to someone or be on the receiving end. I feel shame. I feel happy and at the same, incontrolably, anxious. 
 

 When I think of those situations in my head, it never ends happily, I stop at a point where i'm too anxious because of the thought. I'm 30 years-old and its really getting in the way of me being myself around people, showing love to those who deserve it. It naturally gets in the way of forming love-based relationships."
"Short success story. I (M33) went recently to a convention. By the end of the day, I was bummed out I never got to take pictures with cosplayers, and truth is, I was feeling anxious through the day and I was rationalizing my anxiety too (""I don't know this character"" or ""they're not as impressive""). But I had one more hour, and had no intention to leave without having a picture with a cosplayer.
 

 So, I just gathered my courage. It was easy at first because I REALLY wanted a picture with one specific cosplay, and felt a bit more anxious with the following ones. I managed to get about 5 to 6 pictures through that hour, and now I have a few memories I can boast about, albeit they are low quality (bad camera and worse photographer), but it was worth it.
 

 And for the record, I've been quite some time in therapy to handle my anxiety, and now I managed to approach total strangers. I can't wait to let my therapist know!
 

 That's it, I'm happy I could overcome my anxiety. Thanks for reading!"
"I know you need to focus on your breathing and all that. But when I'm in therapy and my therapist wants to help me practice mindfulness, it literally only makes it worse. I'm sitting there with my eyes closed, thinking about more things that will cause me even worse anxiety because my brain is broken. I'm sitting there with intrusive thoughts and unable to relax. I realize I likely have some form of OCD as well and I'm really hoping during my first ever Psychiatry apt last week that he picked up on it.
 

 I'm worried all the time. I don't think I've been able to fully relax in months. I just want to get better and I'm worried that I won't ever be back at a functional level again."
I wanted to and planned toob(I bought 8 bags of candy!) but the anxiety is too high. I expected my neighbors to be doing it but they're not and there's too many people in too big of packs and wearing costumes on top of it all. This is so embarrassing. I'm 31...
"Hey everyone, I've been suffering from anxiety since I was 12 and I'm 32 now. It is usually anticipatory anxiety related to jobs. It doesn't seem to matter what job it is, but some definitely trigger it more than others. I'm only working part time right now because of it and honestly about to quit, because my shift starts at 3pm and I wake up at 6am, so from 6 to 3, my heart rate is 20-30 bpm faster than normal, I'm sweating, have zero appetite and have to force feed myself so I don't lose weight, cannot enjoy hobbies or anything else. Once I get home from work at around 6:30 pm, I'm energetic and happy at least as much as I'm able to be until the inevitable cycle repeats the next day.
 

 I know in my mind how absolutely absurd it is but I cannot fix it. I'm overly sensitive to stimuli and stress. Once the actual event comes to pass or I'm engaged in it, the anxiety eases. I feel like it is destroying my body, though. I'm at the gym every other day trying to gain muscle while eating healthy and attempting a calorie surplus, but I find it difficult to add weight because, in my opinion, stress is breaking down my muscle. It is beyond frustrating as I can't even have a goal outside of work.
 

 Anyway, I kind of just wanted to vent a bit and get some advice. What's worse is that over the years my doctor has prescribed 6 or 7 antidepressants and they all make my anxiety so much worse that I basically feel like I've entered psychosis and need to be admitted. I don't hallucinate, but I have extreme agitation, tension, anxiety, paranoia, and insomnia. For example, we retried Zoloft last week at 50mg/day and it elevated my heart rate to about 120 bpm resting, couldn't sleep for 3 days, and I came to work shaking worse than I have ever in my life. My doc suggested to get off of it and switch to buspirone after this week. It just feels like a never ending cycle of trial and error that just screws my brain up even more and risks an ER visit every time. I'm honestly traumatized by meds so I don't even know what the next step is for me.
 

 Being 32, I need independence financially and I can't have that until this anxiety is resolved. Has anyone tried buspirone or buspar and experienced positive things? I should mention my diagnoses are social anxiety, panic attack disorder, GAD, and depression, although I also highly suspect I have PTSD from a variety of traumatic events in my life such as a rigorous PhD program in mathematics that I stubbornly continued despite extremely poor mental and physical health until I ended up in the hospital."
"I am not sure if it is the right sub to post but i hope i can get some help.
 

 

 We married and moved in together 3 years ago after a 10 year relationship. Recently around 1 year ago, we got into a car accident that left me with a fractured rib and she lost 1 leg and 1 arm. That accident left us many scars both physically and emotionally. I have mostly healed and started working just recently, but she is not getting better. She hates herself now, even though i always try to calm her and reassure her that i will always love her no matter what and i still am. I have never felt like her being a burden, but she still feels that way, our families were no help too, i moved her away from our families to avoid the conflict as they want me to remarry. She cries a lot, she sometimes throws fit too, i set up remote work to be able to take care of her all day but it always seems not enough. She talks about if she should just kill herself, it broke my heart , i always try to console her but it never seems to be better. What can i do to be able to help her mentally.
 

 

 For therapy and the such, we are from a developing country where mental health care is not a thing yet and we mostly expect people to tough it out"
"Do you have any recommendations of shows to watch that help to calm your anxiety?
 

 I was watching the Amazing Race but it's not available on streaming anymore. Then I started watching American horror story since it's fantasy/so outrageous that it didn't trigger my anxiety. That's until season 7 became a bit too real (Cult) since the main character has severe anxiety.
  
  Wondering what everyone's elses go-to shoes are are at times of high anxiety, if any.
 

 Edit: Thank you so much everyone for the suggestions. There's a number of shows that I never would have considered that I would be looking at more closely in the future.
 

 I also wanted to share my list of shows. I just needed new ideas because at this point I have the show's below memorized and I need something fresh to distract me from the anxiety 
 

 In no particular order
 

 Sailor moon, Aladdin and the little mermaid from Disney, Bob Ross
 

 Friends, Brooklyn 99, Shitts Creek, The office,
 The nanny, Sabrina (Nickelodeon), Malcolm in the Middle, Modern Family, Derry Girls 
 

 Harry Potter, the X files, supernatural, charmed, Buffy, angel, Veronica Mars, Sherlock Holmes (B.C.) stranger things, Girlmore Girls, Roswell, Arrival (movie but still), Hunger Games (honestly I was too young to appreciate how good the story is), all Marvel although end game is only if I need to cry...like, a lot.
 

 I'm going to be checking out The Sopranos, New Girl. Ghost Whisperer, and rewatching Sailor Moon (new version) and all the Dragon Ball series."
"Reddit is becoming a very obvious distraction for me. Every day I'm slowly becoming more and more demotivated to do the things in life I want to do but that make me feel anxious / afraid / uncomfortable. Reddit and YouTube are just easy distractions. I often hate so much of Reddit too but it's so easy to use it to occupy my mind so I don't think about all the other negative thoughts or get frustrated with other parts of my life.
 

 I had the day off today and did basically nothing all day. Just checked my phone and managed to have 7.5 hours screentime on Reddit. So embarrassing to admit.
 

 Have any advice to help?"

"I have dealt with debilitating health anxiety and OCD since my parents unexpectedly died when I was a kid (random heart attack at 34, breast cancer at 40). I have avoided meds all my life but now I am 31 with three kids and enough is enough. I know I need meds. I was prescribed zoloft 50mg after my last baby 4 months ago but my health anxiety makes me refuse to take it (vicious cycle).
 

 I need to see someone -- but who? A psychologist? A psychiatrist? Some kind of special OCD therapist?
 

 Here's what I deal with -- I stay up all night for multiple nights in a row on google, reddit, and facebook convincing myself I have some random disease. It will consume me for like 4 days before I move on to the next obsession. Every little heart rate increase convinces me I dying of a heart attack. I'm so irritable when one of my kids interrupts me while Im obsessively scrolling through google about my health problem. I do beleive the anxiety is accompanied by depression. Mind you I am still 4 months postpartum from my babys birth but I have dealt with this well before now.
 

 My insurance covers mental health. I just don't know who to book with? Is it true a psychologist cannot prescribe meds? Will the zoloft I have from my midwife help with all of the above? UGHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
"I am 33 and live in the UK, I passed my test in an automatic 2 months ago on my first attempt.
 

 It's taken me until 33 to learn to drive because I've genuinely always hated it, it's always scared me and I've never felt comfortable doing it but I recently had 2 babies and I wanted to be able to go do things with them while my husband is at work.
 

 I've been trying to force myself to go out and drive every day or two to gain confidence and reduce anxiety but it seems to have gotten a lot worse since passing my test.
 

 Last week I decided to drive somewhere I hadn't driven to before, about 25 minutes in I had to pull over because I felt weird, I then had a full blown panic attack where I literally couldn't breath or swallow, it felt like my throat had completely closed, thankfully my husband was with me and once it has passed he drove us home.
 

 I have cried when arriving at my destination of 99% of the drives I've done since passing my test and now I'm scared I'm going to have a random panic attack while driving the kids somewhere.
 

 This isn't normal and I'm going to be so disappointed in myself if I give up but I don't know what to do to get over this feeling of complete dread when I'm driving somewhere.
 

 Any advice or thoughts would be really appreciated."
"I've had social anxiety since 12 or 13 years old, pretty much since I hit puberty. When I was in secondary school, around the age of 16, I noticed that I started to go red, but for no reason. It then developed throughout my twenties, and became so bad that I would avoid seeing certain people and places and I still do to this day. I'm 32 now, and the last year and a half, I've been seeing a therapist and going to group social anxiety therapy, to try and help me cope. Along with my various socially anxious attributes, such as shaking, stuttering and the essential, beating myself up on a regular daily basis, going red has to really held me back. It happens around certain people (mainly at work and mainly around men), but for no reason I can put my finger on. I didn't go to the staff room at all last year, just to avoid one particular man (whom I have no attraction to), just because I knew I could bump into him, and would go red. This was noticed by senior management, and did have an affect on my job and mentioned in my review and future in my role...I was just wondering if anyone has experienced this and if so, what has helped? I am trying to visualize myself calm and it can help, but I'm really getting tired of it - the feeling of shame it evokes in me is awful and I can see the uncomfortable look on the people's faces! I realize that I'll always have to live with anxiety to an extent, it's a part of me, but I'd love to calm this aspect, I'd anyone has any ideas. Thanks so much"
"Hi, I'm 33 years old male. I have a wife and 3 kids and work full time. I am also a full time student about to get my associate's degree. I ha e had GAD since I was 14
 Lately I seem to be getting anxious at work a lot, I work 2nd shift and am getting so burned out because I work at a Behavioral Group Home
 Any advice to someone like me?"
"It's pretty much the cardinal sin of a fast paced world
 

 I get it now why a woman would go for exciting violent guys instead of boring anxious reddit dorks, she can survive some broken ribs, but boredom literally kills you a slow death.
 

 Do everything you can to be impulsive, its the only way to live."
"(M34) I’ve only recently started looking at taking action regarding my SA so I’m curious to hear some success stories from others to lend some hope. 
 

 I’m married, no kids. feeling pretty lonely tbh with no real friends.
 

 Worked the same menial low paying job for 18 years . I struggle to envision doing anything else. Feels like I’ve stagnated and honestly I feel stupid, like my capacity for learning isn’t there anymore. 
 

 Feel pretty depressed when taking a step back and looking at my life. Feels like a complete waste . I’ve contemplated a job change or going back to school before but ultimately I do nothing.
 

 Suppose I just want to hear from people who’ve been in a similar boat and found some way out on to something better ."
"I (34m) have had an apartment with my wife for almost 2 years now and I haven't had any of my friends over in that time. I'll a few time a year drive the 1.5 hours to go to their places but never once have I asked anyone to come to my place (other than family). Honestly, i want to have people over but i feel like I'm so boring I don't even know what we would do. 
 

 

 I know that it's some weird mental BS because if I just had them over I'm sure we would figure out something and it would be absolutely fine. But I've always lived with my family up until moving here and would never have people over due to either me wanting to get away from said family or their house was a mess. I feel a little out of touch when it comes to entertaining.  
 

 

 Do any of you have strategies for getting over this feeling? I feel like I'm missing out seeing more of the couple of friends i have left"
"Then realize naah ur just the silent type.
 

 Strong ppl are loud, only anxoius losers cope with this stuff"
What was the moment when you discovered that the medication wasn't necessary and that you could handle your inner turmoil without the needed of drug assistance?
"This has been my life the last three months. I had a random panic attack (first ever) early this summer, and life has not been the same since.
 

 I have what by all accounts would be a wonderful life. Healthy spouse and children. Great relationships across the board. I myself am healthy and fit. Financials are in a great spot. I'm truly a lucky person. I have no major life stressors.
 

 But something happened to me after that panic attack when I realized for the first time how powerful the mind was, and how much inner destruction it could do. Now I almost always feel anxious and uneasy with a tense feeling ruminating in the chest.  
 

 I'm not concerned about anything specific in life. Not work, not relationships, etc. Nothing that in all my prior years of life would ever cause me to feel like this. But now I'm always on edge. When I'm feeling good I'm wondering when that feelings of unease will return. And they inevitably do, usually without any type of clear trigger.
 

 I was prescribed Lexapro 10mg, took it for 3 months but I'm now tapering off. It gave me headaches causing more stress and unease and didn't resolve any of the ruminating anxiety.
 

 For those who also feel they struggle with anxiety but have nothing specific causing it, how have you learned to cope with/overcome these issues?"
"What are everyone's experience on Prozac?
 

 

 Got extreme anxiety when everything went into lock down in 2020 and had a super bad anxiety attack. I've been using talk therapy for two years that has helped and also have developed natural (non-medicine) coping mechanisms. I have gotten better but I am still pretty high strung, have an underlying anxiety vibe with intrusive thoughts (like being a hypochrondriac, etc). 
 

 So my BF is taking it and it helps him. So I spoke with my doctor and she said it is a gentle ssri that's not addictive and could help with my anxiety and she wants me to start on 10mg. I told my bf and then he seemed to panic and told me not to take it, that he didn't think I needed it (whole other story), and that it would change my personality.
 

 I know there is a potential reaction but is it that bad?
 

 My doctor said at most my anxiety may get a little worse before it gets better. 
 

 Just looking for some experience. 
 

 

 Thank you!"
"I am 32 years old and am diagnosed with tourette syndrome and OCD. I have had chronic anxiety my whole life and have tried nearly every SSRI and anxiety med out there. I have tried every nootropic used to treat anxiety as well as CBD oil. I have also tried CBT therapy and ketamine infusion. I am actively looking at trying neurofeedback therapy, and am curious if anyone with similar symptoms has had success with this, or if my condition is too severe for this treatment. 
 

 My main issue is my anxiety is debilitating to the point where I can hardly function.. I can't sleep at night because I constantly worry about my job, wife and kids. I get so nervous at work that it is difficult to talk, get shortness of breath and can hardly get the words out. I get shakes because I get so anxious and nervous. And no.. meditation, breathing exercises, etc does not work for me. I don't know what to do because nothing has helped me to this point and I really don't want to get back on benzos. Does anyone have any suggestions?"

"I have PTSD, GAD, and SAD. I also have Severe Bipolar 1 w/psychosis, and SUD.
 

 Today, I am 32 days sober from Alcohol and Cannabis.
 

 And I've never felt worse. I can't even leave the house, except to go to my IOP program which I've been in for a month. 
 

 I had a panic attack at the NA meeting I picked up my 30 day token at, and had to leave halfway through.
 

 Alcohol was the only thing holding me together. I desperately need thought suppression. However, 7 years ago, I abused the Xanax I was prescribed and admitted to it. Big mistake.
 

 I've cycled through EVERY medication for anxiety that I CAN take. And none of them have done ANYTHING except make me want to sleep. Until I got put on prazosin, sleeping made it even worse.
 

 I've attempted suicide, twice, because of the anxiety. I almost succeeded the second time.
 

 I constantly have suicidal thoughts. Constantly. Every day. Because I'm not living anymore. I have to get a job soon, because my mom is 6k in debt after supporting me for a while. And I have no fucking idea how I'm going to do that. My suicidal thoughts are so bad, that I'm getting what's called ""flash forwards."" It's like a flashback, only instead of the past, I essentially disconnect from reality atleast once every day and have a convincing vision of myself violently murdering me. Flooring it and driving into a tree, taking handfuls of pills, dangling from a rope, suicide by cop, you name it. It's entirely involuntary and terrifying. Yes, I've told my care team about it. Yes, there's no intent. Yet.
 

 They won't put me on a benzo because they ""want what's best for me."" 
 

 They're going to kill me."
"I've had a history of anxiety over the last 15 years. Anxiety/panic attacks that always seem to take their form in physical ailments. In late 2020, I started noticing that my heart would continue beating fairly fast after my workouts and it seemed like I was having some trouble with my breathing. I'm 32 (31 when this started), I don't smoke, I don't drink. I've been lifting weights and bodybuilding (naturally) for 10 years. I don't take protein powders, I don't take pre workout. I drink about 8oz of homemade cold brew coffee on workout days, but that's about it. I eat a whole food diet, non gmo, I'm gluten free, eat my healthy fats, love my greens, high quality protein. I'm healthy as shit lol. 
 

 I kind of ignored it and eventually it just kind of went away in the spring of 2021. As summer was ending, I got a stomach bug and then a few weeks later my eye started twitching. Over time, it got worse and I started having stroke like symptoms in the gym. I would get really dizzy, temples would get tight, I'd get nauseous and my face would go numb. Eventually I started having what I assumed were anxiety attacks. And in October, I had a panic attack so bad I had to be taken to the hospital by a coworker because I thought I was having a heart attack. Heart beating over 200bpm, hands and lips were blue, couldn't breath, I was starting to black out, couldn't even talk. It's been hell ever since. I lost my apartment and had to move in with my family. I started feeling a little better but it's rearing it's head again and I just signed a lease in Nashville (700 miles away) that starts in 2 weeks. 
 

 I've had almost half a dozen EKGs, I've had a full ECG, chest x rays, blood tests, wore a heart monitor for 2 days while doing my day to day stuff, all have shown nothing. I'm at a loss. My temples pulse with pain, my chest hurts so bad, I feel like I'm gonna pass out, I get pain and numbness in my left arm, tingling in my hands and fingers, I get dizzy all the time. I can't hike anymore because every time I go hiking it triggers a full panic attack, deep in the woods, miles from anyone. And I've been an avid hiker for almost a decade. 
 

 I'm at my witts end. I shouldn't feel this way. I'm 32 and built like incredibly well for someone who is 100% natural. Does anyone else have it similar to this? It's like my mind is telling me a fake story and using my own body as the conduit for evidence that it's real. Even when the doctors tell me I'm fine, it's hard to believe them given how I feel. Any advice, stories or words of encouragement are appreciated."
"Trigger story warning …..My ex partner died 2,5 years ago at the at age of 30 from pancreatic cancer. Since then something cracked and I’m having a big fear and anxiety I might be sick as well. Im healthy 31f and I don’t have any issues im visiting doctor regularly for blood or scans. But still I can’t sleep because of this fear which feels like is wrapping around me. 
 

 I have a small child and this fear is even greater when I imagine I would leave her when something happens to me. It’s a living torture. everytime I have monologue’s in my head where I’m trying to convince myself all is well and I should be calm. Sometime I feel like I’m truly losing my mind. 
 

 Please if someone has some similar problems it would mean the world to me if you share some of yours experiences and tips how to handle this.

"Hello. I am 30 year old male who works out regularly but kind of overworked lately. I dont usually have a history of panic attack or anxiety as such. But once in a while i feel i am going to have a heart attack or something and my heart rate goes up extremely fast and i keep looking at my apple watch for that. My resting heart rate is actually very low in general (Low 50s). My low heart rate made me go to a heart specialist but he said it is nothing to worry about. A lot of people have lower than 60 resting heart rate. 
 

 Coming back to my anxiety/panic attack. I am usually feeling throat soreness and also blocked nose, so i take a normal clarityn when i feel that way. 
 

 But today i had taken 25g of hydroxyl medicine. 30 minutes after i started feeling extremely hot and my heart rate went to 150-160. And this made me panic even more. 
 

 

 I rushed to the ER. Theey said nothing is wrong. It was just a reaction to the medicine which i have never taken before.
 

 Can my medicine atarax (hydroxyl) cause this reaction? Or was it my psychological reaction caused it?"
"About 7 weeks ago, I had a relapse of GAD symptoms due to a stressful job change where I’m in a training environment until December followed by a pending relocation. I also recently had my first child with my wife back in May, and he’s awesome but definitely another major change in my life. 
 

 My main symptoms that come up are restlessness, feeling edgy, heart palpitations, and a little insomnia. I’d had my symptoms controlled completely for over 3 years with therapy, exercise, and medication. I was taking 60mg Cymbalta and 300mg Gabapentin at night during this maintenance period, and had Ativan on hand but used it maybe once in those three years.
 

 When the symptoms first arose, I did have to take Ativan (.5 mg) three times during the first week of training at night to settle down and sleep. My psychiatrist then upped my gabapentin dosage to 600mg at night 600mg split between the morning and afternoon.
 

 After about two weeks of this change, I finally started to settle in with the training and feel better. I didn’t need Ativan at all after the first week and felt close to normal most days, but I am still in a stressful environment. I thought I had finally moved towards the finish line, but this week my anxiety symptoms flared again, coming and going at various times.
 

 I have needed Ativan two times this week. I have been able to get through the training at work and have been doing well, but it has been hard at times. I’m just really nervous of recovering from this relapse and not wanting to get addicted to Ativan if I need to take it.
 

 I have had success in the past of “accepting” when I feel the anxiety and found Dr. Claire Weekes’ philosophy to be helpful. But of course, here I am overthinking things because I can feel the anxiety. My psychiatrist has stated we can see how the next week goes and see if we can increase Cymbalta to 120mg.
 

 I guess I’m just having a lot of fears about some uncertainties at the moment. I know the work change was a trigger, but it will be over in December. 
 

 When am I going to feel completely better again?
 

 Am I going to get addicted to Ativan if I have to take it a few times a week until December?
 

 Will the cymbalta increase help my symptoms? Is it normal to have a temporary increase in medication dosage to help cope with recent stressors and then decrease dosage later?
 

 Thanks!"
"Long story short: Like a dumbass I took a cashiering / customer service job in which I will be the only cashier / CSA during the busiest shifts of the day (including weekends potentially.) I've only had three hours of register training and I'm stressing out so much I can neither eat or sleep. I'm terrified of these people I'm going to have to serve and of screwing up. Any advice on how to cope or make it through this?  
 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
 

 

 While looking for jobs in the area I'm currently living in (perhaps until December at least) I ended up taking perhaps the worst one I possibly could: Cashiering at a pharmacy. My Social Anxiety is so severe that I can barely even talk to people online directly, and I struggle a lot in real life too. Sure I can smile and stumble through a conversation but inside I'm screaming and want to run.  
 

 

 Why then did I think a cashier / customer support combo role was a good idea? To top it off, they're all eight hour closing shifts, every single one. Starts at 3PM and ends at 10PM. Work both saturday and sunday and on week days so I also get to deal with rush hour. My first real shift is tomorrow, after only 3 hours of training on the register, and there will only be two other associates in the entire store tomorrow for the duration of my shift. 1 stocker, 1 lead, and me the only cashier / customer service guy. I'm especially nervous because I stutter and slur words when I'm anxious and I tend to be a physically clumsy person with my hands, but worst of all? I'm terrible with number sequences and quick math so distributing change is going to be a nightmare.  
 

 

 It's been non stop panic for days and sleepless nights, and when I do fall asleep the moment I wake up the anxiety just kind of climbs onto me like a monster waiting at the end of the bed.  
 

 

 I'm 30 years old now and hoped I'd grow out of this nonsense back when I was 19. What the hell is wrong with me? Further more, what made me think this was a good idea?"
"For more than 15 years, my anxiety comes with severe pain in the nerves of my nose, I can say in tge roof of my mouth going up until the top of my throat where it connects with my nose.( I have also other sumpthons but tgey seem everyone has them)
 Does anyone have it ? And what is exacly the cause of it? Is it a defecenty of some kind?
 I suspect that the fact my body tenses up when I am anxious but I cant confirm it."
"Hello all, I 31f just started xanax for the first time yesterday. It’s helping but I feel like my head is constantly clouding, and im constantly feeling out of it. The anxiety is marginally better though. Is this normal or will my head start to clear. I can’t just quit ether. Will it get any better but still work? I’m suffering to much to switch. I feel like it’s this dose or nothing"
"I've (33f) been with my bf (34m) for about... 10 months now, maybe 9. I'm not good at keeping track. He's done some things to piss me off and make me insecure (following instagram models) but when I told him I didn't appreciate it he fixed the problem immediately. Unfortunately for him... it opened a huge can of worms for me. 
 

 Before him I was in a 5 year emotionally abusive relationship that turned physical towards the end. I am so scared to get back in another relationship like that.
 

 My current bf is completely opposite. If I am upset, he consoles me. If I have anxiety, he wants to help me. He sends me the sweetest messages... I can't help but overthink it and convince myself he is lying and up to something. I've convinced myself he wants to help me with my anxiety so he can use it to manipulate me in the future. 
 

 I've never been with such a sweet man that actually cares about me and building me up. It's the scariest shit ever. I dont know how to cope. I've had awful luck with therapists and meds. Not only do I have anxiety, I also have Bipolar 2 and ptsd. 
 

 What are some good coping techniques? I try to stay busy but my brain just doesn't stop. Ever."
"I'm 31 (m), and since I ws in my early 20s I knew I really wanted to have kids. 2 or 3, realistically. I even have names written in my phone.
 

 I've always had bouts of depression and anxiety. The depression stopped in my mid twenties, but the anxiety still comes and goes. The past two months have been particularly bad. I'm working on it, but it's been bad enough that I fear I couldn't handle it. I want to be a great father, but how can I do that when I can get so anxious over simple things? 
 

 Scared I would let them down and not be the best dad for them. 
 

 Are there any parents with anxiety that still kick ass at being a parent? I could really use some advice or happy stories."
"It's been a rough 18 months of hell for me. I've been through the ringer with so many issues and have always had underlying health anxiety but as each issue has stacked up, my health anxiety has gotten worse.
 

 I know it's not helpful to be stressed about a legitimate health problem OR no problem at all... yet, I do it anyways.
 

 This just sucks so bad. I hate it. I hate anxiety. I hate feeling like crap. I hate wondering if I have a terminal, degenerative illness.
 

 Ugh."
"You know when you log into a zoom meeting early with another colleague but you don't know what to talk about you just mute yourself? 
 

 When you are in an elevator with a stranger and the tension and silence is so awkward you can visibly see it? 
 

 Or when in a conversation with a group of colleagues or friends and after you said something there's this dead silence?
 

 I think silence is only awkward if you make it awkward. This silence is just normal and happens to everyone, even the most extroverted, experienced communicators. 
 

 I actually appreciate being in silence around a stranger it feels nice, but many people in that situation would call it “Awkward silence”. 
 

 It’s only awkward if you’re awkward. You’re only awkward if you think you are. It's a thought you gotta get rid of. It's a status you gotta get used to. It's just normal. We gotta learn to get comfortable being uncomfortable. 
 

 It's no big deal and everything will feel alright soon. When you feel alright, you have grown."
"It’s a hard feeling to explain. I (33m) have that impending doom feeling and this aggravated in an abstract way feeling… That is to say that I’m aggravated but not at anyone specific person or thing.
 

 I’m just kind of tired of everyone I know right now. Friends, siblings, spouse, my dog, my cat, random strangers. It feels like being around anyone is an exhausting chore. I love the people I know, but I’m tired of them a billion little things that usually I don’t even care about.
 

 To make things even more anxiety inducing, I’ve been having that feeling that some kind of catastrophe or sign of impending doom is right around the corner. I’ve been avoiding anything news and politics related for this very reason.
 

 I’m on meds (mood disorder issue as well GAD) that seem to be doing their job… but every so often I get this spike in weird anxiety that I described above.
 

 Anyone got any advice for dealing with this? Or a coping strategies that I can utilize? Something I can do for some relief until this particular spike (or episode if you want to call it that) has passed?
 

 Thanks in advance."
"It's the best educational scary movie I ever watched. 
 It may potentially help you deal with your anexiety if you watch it until the end. I was able to successfully manage my OCD and am currently working on my anexiety. The way I'm dealing with these problems reminds me of movie ""IT"".
 

 (The movie is scary but if you're fine with watching a scary movie, you will get my point at the end)
 

 

 The idea is that in order to fight with your anexiety, you should not be afraid of that (the more you'reafraid, the stronger it gets). Instead, you should stand against it, embrace it, and go after it. Then, your anexiety, OCD, etc will gradually go away as it gets weaker and weaker."
"I feel like I can’t live like this anymore. I feel psychotic and deranged all the time. My mind won’t release its own death grip on me. It’s always something. If I resolve an issue it finds something else. 
 

 My bf was my biggest support system and now my brain has decided to turn on him. A month ago I was excited about an impending engagement and suddenly my brain is convincing me he isn’t the one and I won’t be happy with him and it won’t work out and I need to just leave. And then I think ok but if I leave I will deeply regret it. And then I’ll be alone and I’m my 30s and everyone is going to pity me because I just can’t hold on to someone.
 

 I can’t see a future in which I’m happy. My brain won’t allow it. It will always find something. I’m in therapy and on meds but I still feel like this. I need help but I feel so alone and like I have no one to talk to about it."
"I started start lexapro earlier this year. Since then my anxiety has been manageable and it was great. The past couple days i noticed I was feeling more anxious and thought I was doing well with coping until last night. I had an anxiety attack that lasted for an hour and then I couldn’t sleep. It rolled over into today and I’m having a really hard time. I feel like I’m back at square one. I know it will blow over and I’ll probably feel better soon, but today is just hard."
"For the past 3 months I've been waking up almost every night into what seems to be a panic attack.
 

 I have no idea what triggers this... I do not have it during the day at all, pretty much anxiety free during the day. But after I fall asleep (which I don't have an issue doing) I wake up after 1h30m or sometimes 2h30m, and just lay there, start feeling a small buildup in my chest and heart rate. Then an episode is triggered for around 15-20m which I just lay there in bed for it to pass. After that I fall back to sleep with little to no issues... 
 

 0 ideas to why this is triggered. Doctors have no idea either so I'm asking you guys if you've experienced anything like this before or have an idea to what's going on. 
 

 TL;DR: I'm waking up after 1-2hours of sleep with a racing heart that lasts 15-20minutes and I don't know why."
"Hi,
 

 It might be a long post but forgive me about it. I really feel like I need to load this all off from my head and I really need some support and help.
 

 In short, I am 32 years old male, relatively healthy with a good job, in a relationship etc. It overall sounds too good to be here.
 

 But I have severe hypochondria which I think grew up to GAD. I am basically worrying about everything, all the time. 
 

 I believe it all started when I was young (probably around 16 years old) - at that young age I was basically living alone and my parents simply sent me money to live. It is hard to explain why this was the case but it does not really matter.
 

 I was a really fat guy, playing on his PC 24/7, had a few friends only and barely got out of my house.
 

 One day I got sick, probably the flu, but something in me was triggered and this was my first hypochondriac episode. I did not really knew what I was sick from so I went to the hospital and they directly sent me for an x-ray for pneumonia. Back then I thought pneumonia was always deadly and this is basically when I started being really concerned about my health, googling stuff etc.
 

 I somehow started being more social but this did not really help with my hypochondria. I lost some weight at 19-20 and started going to university where I became even more social. Still hypochondriac, though. But at that point this was the only thing I was worrying, life was good otherwise.
 

 At that point I really wanted to f\*\*k girls because I was struggling to even talk to one so I got into pickup, then the infamous r/theredpill (not present anymore) which did not actually make me hate women but rather made me do some really good progress in my life - I lost bunch of weight, became extremely lean and muscular and even had some success with girls. I was still hypochondriac though, to the point that on the NYE I went to the emergency room because I thought I could not breathe and all they asked me was if I was on drugs.
 

 Then I started my first job and quickly got a promotion. I was earning so much money for that time that I was able to afford a new car, live on my own (in a new city) etc. I was basically feeling invincible. But still hypochondriac.
 

 Then one day they fired me, I was young and foolish and did not know my rights etc. and basically agreed to everything they told me. I was left with just a little cash to the side to survive a month or two only. 
 

 This is the moment where everything went downhill for me. A few days later I started another, better paid job. But from that moment on I started having constant fear of losing my current job, what will I do, how will I find another one etc. I basically became extremely anxious of losing my job on top of being hypochondriac.
 

 At that moment I had a GF (my fiancee now) who was supportive but said I have to seek treatment for my anxiety. I always dismissed that. 
 

 Now, at the very moment, I have a fiance, own house, own car, well paying job etc. And I worked my ass off for everything - I do not have rich parents or friends etc. I actually have zero friends.
 

 Basically all the things that most people dream of. 
 

 But I smoke, I drink every night (not getting drunk though), I am worrying about the slightest pain in my body and google the shit out of it, every few days I am scared of being fired etc. And this is really starting to bring me down. My own fiance does not believe me anymore when I am really feeling unwell. She started to really push me to seek help and said if I do not, she will leave me. 
 

 My anxiety is so serious that when I have a problem, no matter what, I start thinking/googling the shit out of it for days/weeks and totally ignore the rest of the things in my life - fiance, work, personal development, sport etc.
 

 I am also scared of visiting a psychiatrist because he might diagnose me as mentally ill.
 

 I basically do not know what to do guys. If you can give me an advice, I would really appreciate it."
I’m 32f - I was in a straight marriage for almost ten years and hated sex. Now I’m with a woman and I love her so much and I finally enjoy sex. The problem is…I still have generalized anxiety disorder. I stopped taking Lexapro because I wanted to be able to feel things and actually have a sex drive. My doctor switched me to Wellbutrin. I can feel things now but I am shaky and nauseous all the time and I don’t think it’s doing anything for my anxiety at all. I know most SSRIs have the low libido side effect. Does anyone have any positive experiences? I’m about to just stop taking anything and see how it goes. But I do feel like my best self in Lexapro 😞
"I don't like to post on reddit, unless I feel like I don't know where to start.
 I have been coming in and out of depression probably since I was 23 and coped with drugs, alcohol and any attention with men. I can say that I'm an addict, but some morals I don't like to cross after I felt the full affect of the negative of my actions.
 But what I now realized, that even though I am better now and do less than I did from the age 24 to 29, I still didn't fully realize was that I was running away from my problems instead of facing them.
 I tried anti depressants, detox and therapy; but since I have Kaiser, I feel like they don't really care, so I feel like I'm alone in this. 
 I decided to fully quit drinking on Monday and plan to really try to focus on the gym and realizing more on my social anxiety disorder (cause, a coworker that started a year ago, gets more ""hello's"" at work than me; and I've worked there for 5 years now). And maybe purchasing a CBT audiobook in order to face my anxiety and standoffish personality. 
 

 I am here to ask, what did you guys do? What else should I do to get better and actually be happy.
 

 Thank you in advance.
 

 TLTR: My medical provider kind of sucks, what can I do to beat my self diagnosed Social Anxiety Disorder by myself"
"I (30M) have anxiety and depression and hate my body. This cause the usual problema that stem from these things, like avoiding socialising, not having a relationship and feeling and being alone. 
 

 I do therapy but I still feel lost, it feels like it will never get better and I’m frustrated that life made me this way. 
 

 Did anyone actually manage to change, reduce their anxiety and stop being afraid, loving themselves and their flaws and start living a great and happy life?"
"Going to be short. Been having a stressful month or two. Had a break up. Got really mad the other day and my chest hurt. I immediately laid down and i felt better (also had gas, could have been gas), but then the next day I have this weird pickly tingly kind of pain/feeling on my lower throat right behind the left tendon that sticks out. The pain kind of extends to the left side of my neck sometimes. Been trying to rest, hard to with work. I'm sure I'm fine but I'm such a cardiophobe at this point, it's frustrating. I have pre mature atrial contractions l, and that doesn't help. But my whole body feels sore. 
 

 

 I hate being anxious. So much. 
 

 Thanks for listening to this. Please tell me I'll be ok"

"Hi everyone!
 

 34F here. I’ve had my license since I was 18 and used to be really comfortable driving around on my own in my hometown. Everything changed when I moved out to go to college near a major metropolitan city. The roads were much narrower, there were more people, and you needed to get on the freeway to go literally anywhere. 
 

 I made a lot of mistakes, learned from them, and adapted okay other than getting comfortable driving on the freeway.. I’d avoid them entirely and try to drive locally as much as possible. I then met my current partner and just stopped driving altogether. It’s been more than a decade and I know I need to get back to driving to become more independent. Relying on my partner to get anywhere has become a huge problem in our relationship and I really want to change that. 
 

 It’s been so long since I’ve driven that it gives me a lot of anxiety to even think about getting in the driver’s seat now. I don’t mind relearning how to drive locally but my biggest fear has always been merging onto the freeway and also changing lanes. There’s something about the high speed and having to make split second decisions on a 4-6 lane freeway that terrifies me. I’ve made plenty of potentially dangerous mistakes driving on the freeway before and it’s really put a damper on my confidence. 
 

 How did you find the courage get back behind the wheel? How did you gain the confidence to drive on freeways? Any and all advice would be appreciated. Thank you ❤️"
"Hi all,
 

 My life has been going well so far. Although recently, my anxiety has acted up again. I have adhd and am on medication for anxiety. Recently my anxiety has spiraled and this has been the issue that triggered it:
 

 1. I met this guy online. Super nice, sweet very respectful. We talked for 2 weeks online and when I met him, we had a good time. Although he did some things I found a bit off and red flags: we went to a bar, he drank excessively, but was telling me he was nervous. We decided to come to my place to hang out after but then he went to the bathroom and I heard snorting. I looked there was white residue. I asked him, he lied about it but then confessed he was so nervous about meeting me and kissing me. Basically he had a very rough pass, went to rehab many times, says he only does drugs sometimes but either way - I didn’t like it. 
 He also turned out to have a criminal record and what I found very strange is that he had two cellphones. So clearly this is not good. I was planning on not seeing him again because I was disappointed how he turned out to be nothing like our conversations.
 

 I was sad and disappointed. The following days he apologized to me endlessly saying he knows he screwed up about doing what he did at my place and wanted to see me again. I told myself - I can see him just once again and really decide then that he really isn’t good, I wasn’t planning on seeing him seriously but just to convince myself because otherwise that, he was very sweet. 
 We texted here and there throughout the week and had plans to see each other. Night of, he canceled. Obviously another red flag. Then I am really convinced this isn’t good. Although he really wants to see me again. 
 

 2. I made the mistake of telling my parents. My dad was wondering if I’ve been seeing anyone and I told him all about the sketchy behaviour and wasn’t planning on seeing him again, but just talking to him. My parents growing up were extremely worried parents. Good people, mean well, but very very neurotic. My dad freaked out saying it’s dangerous, there can be legal implications, I could be framed, seems like a drug dealer etc etc and then what hurt me the most was that he said how someone like that, do you really think this guy is actually interested in you, in dating you, out of all the people he can date. Basically implying that this guy might have bad intentions towards me and not interested seriously because of his past and behaviour, knowing what he meant that someone like that can’t be truly interested in a serious relationship. But it still hurt me how he phrased that. 
 

 3. All this fear, all this paranoia my parents told me made me feel very anxious just by simply textingthis guy. I started getting extreme anxiety just sending simply text to him and feeling very wrong about conversing with him. I am not dating him and am not planning to, I just wanted to see him again, just once to convince myself fully. All this fear really got to my head, and made me think the worse assumptions. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt - obviously all signs point to bad things and my parents just want me to be cautious but I feel like they over reacted and it really made my anxiety worse. 
 

 4. I know my parents mean well but I regret telling them precisely because of how badly they reacted - my mom asking me if I am losing it by wanting to see this person again. I understand he doesn’t sound like a saint but I do feel like they are over reacting and over protecting.
 

 5. My anxiety got really bad to the point of me having paranoid thoughts of being implicated in something really bad just by texting this guy and seeing him just once again. Obviously nothing bad happened but my mind got the worse of me.
 

 6. I had an emotionally unavailable mom growing up - she never expressed praise of warmth but showed her love in other ways and I feel this contributed to me being codependent. I had many toxic relationships in the past, men who would yoyo with my feelings, mentally Ill partners who would not treat me well, and I made the mistake of continuing and seeing them and giving them a chance. I feel this guy is activating this in me again and my mom is strongly disapproving because of this precisely, everything sounds bad about this guy but for some reason I just want to see him just once to convince myself that it isn’t good.
 

 7. I am torn between wanting to see him again just once but so anxious even if I just see him once about how bad this is. I feel like my parents still try to control me and I made the mistake of opening up about this to them. 
 

 8. I am anxious and confused and not feeling right. I’d just see him once and feel like it’s the end of the world. 
 

 I feel like I know it’s wrong but I am not seeing him seriously or planning on getting married with him. Can someone please offer me some thoughts ?"
"[Warning.. lots of women's hooha health venting]
 

 

 For 5 yrs, my(32F) UTIs and few kidney infections has made me suffer so much and it kept progressing. It made my agoraphobic tendencies get worst. Only tine i managed to get out was through the UTI pains that required me to do lab tests, go to clinics, or pharmacies... Until we finally got ""results"" after countless tests through the 5 yrs. I had/have ureaplasma.
 

 It went bad from there.. my discomfort began after treatment for 3 months and then my dental emergencies and was put on more antibiotics that gave a different kind of burning like yeast infection. Its been wild..
 

 My follow up tests keep being pushed back and either i got yeast infection again or it never left. But had my first UTI since the ureaplasma treatment. Tbh i feel like my vag needs time to heal and i shoukd just deal with the discomfort to avoid doing things down there. But my god.. its just upsetting. Tbh i feel like my treatment was too little, docs aren't listening, i feel like my bf of 5yrs and I are getting false negatives. It just doesn't feel like a pelvic floor thing but treatment issue.
 

 About the dental emergencies. It's pushed that i should get braces because I'm just going to keep getting cavities and stains because of the crooked teeth. And tbh next cavities has more potential to turn into root canal infections due to the same spots. So i went for 1 consultation because i also want to remove this severe overjet/overbite. And i heard the worst. The ""ortho"" was mean but i feel like it is more because he is under-qualified. It hurts because it made me revisit about my unidentifiable autoimmune disorder with the past 13 doctors i went to over the 8yrs. The ortho basically said he can't do much about the overjet/overbite and wants to remove more teeth but also tells me i don't have enough teeth(?). He also told me my bones &amp; teeth are so weak that i can't do implants or veneers. It made me feel like i will be full of rotting &amp; missing teeth by my late 30s.
 

 I know he is just 1 orthodontist. 1 opinion. But still the shock. I'm just so tired. Especially knowing that i need to try to get referred asap to a uro-gynocologist. But to be honest, i should find a new GP too. Because who the hell stops after confirming that i have autoimmune disorder but doesn't examine or want to try to find out as a doc to treat. His energy rubbed off on me for the past 3yrs. 
 

 I'm just so exhausted because all these expenses. I need money for dental work, treatment, and i feel its important to go see a psychotherapist asap again, and try a pelvic floor therapist. But the lack of funds. The pain is unbearable. I just been crying so much. My head hurts. Im in constant discomfort. Everything i eat triggers pain. God has been so loud and clear since i was born. I'm exhausted."
So last week (Thursday) I felt sorta sluggish/heavy and for some reason checked my pulse..It seemed low and kinda freaked me out a bit! So yesterday I went to the doctor and told her how I constantly check my pulse have an occasional slight chest pain and I get super sweaty sometimes shortness of breathe I guess when I freak myself out! Blood pressure was good and she listened to my heart/lungs said inwas ok and prescribed me Hydroxizine. Took one last night and felt great but today after waking up I feel kinda jittery/can't sit down...Is that part of having anxiety? I'm new to all this I'm 30 years old and have no info about anxiety what so ever!! I freak out about my heart because heart problems run in My family and I'm the type that thinks of the worst possible scenario! going to cardiologist sometime next month just for a checkup and what not. Just wanted to vent a little and maybe get some feedback Thankyou!!
"My anxiety is really bad, and it takes my mind to the dark side a lot. 
 

 Last night's episode of FBI International had a child groomer as the villain. And I caught myself thinking ""What if that was me?"" I then caught myself impersonating his accent and saw myself in his role and I freaked out. Now I think I might have just been acting, but I felt like absolute crap at first because I thought of myself in that monster's position. 
 

 I had to stop and remind myself I was not that person. But I remembered stupid crap I did as a kid, pursuing girls in school because I liked them and very rarely did I have the nerve to talk to them. I had no confidence whatsoever. This led to me getting in school suspension for constantly trying to talk to a girl in high school. Since then I was a lot more careful and I grew up fast. 
 

 Seeing scumbags like that on TV or in the movies makes me feel like crap, and my Mom had to constantly remind me that those people were not me, not were any shy guys in the movies. 
 

 Tl;dr: TV made me picture myself as a bad guy, and memories of my biggest mistake in life came back to haunt me mentally. 
 

 Any advice on what to do when this happens?"
"Hello, 
 

 I feel I should start that I'm currently on a course of medication which one of the side effects is an increase in anxiety so I think that might be the main reason for my vent, but I will talk about what's on my mind as I find writing it down helps me sleep. 
 

 So I (29m) have been talking off and on with a friend of mine (33f) over the last couple of years (I should point out that we've known each other for about 5/6 years) and last year I suggested lets meet up again to which she agreed. We were hoping to meet in July but I had a family thing come up and she's been working towards her doctorate. I've given her some dates for November but I'm nervous she'll cancel and I'll never meet her again. 
 

 I'm on my own a lot of the time and yes, there are people I know who live nearby but if I suggest hanging out they say they'll get back to me when they're free but never do. I have met my aforementioned friend before and had no doubts that I would meet her then but now I'm worried I won't. 
 

 I'm probably worrying over nothing as her and I get on really well - we sometimes talk via skype and when we do we usually stay up till 2/3am, talking utter nonsense and making each other laugh. She means a lot to me and I'm worried I'm going to lose her again.
 

 I say lose her again because there was about a year or so where we didn't talk because she felt that the relationship wasn't go anywhere. I did try to keep the friendship going but for some reason I stopped trying to communicate with her. After about a year though, she messaged me out of the blue much to my surprise. I think she does like me, she's just unsure how to say it to me. Or I might be completely overthinking that and getting my hopes up. I don't want to ruin my friendship with her but I feel my anxiety will get in the way. She knows I'm anxious about meeting and she told me not to worry as we'll meet up and have fun together. She also said 'confidence is sexy' which is the first time she ever said that to me which caught me off guard. 
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 I will probably edit this if I feel I need to update this (its currently 1 in the morning and I have no idea if what I've written makes sense). Not too concerned if anyone's read this, I just needed to vent. If you have read this, thank you and I hope I made sense"
"**Scenario 1:**
 

 &gt;Me: “Hi, do you want to grab coffee with me?”

"I'm a 34M and, the older I get, the more I avoid family gatherings.
 

 I'm happy going to anything that is about my immediate family, but I find other relatives (cousins, aunties / uncles) increasingly difficult.
 

 In those situations I feel like I'm treated like a little child... also \*everyone\* except for me is married and has kids, all my cousins do and I feel like the odd one out.
 

 I can tell my parents and some of my cousins are ashamed of me for never having been in a proper relationship.
 

 I moved to another city and haven't been to a family gathering in years (unless its for my parents or sisters).
 

 Recently my cousin invited me to her wedding and I can't bear the thought of going. To make matters worse there'll be a few people from my school there who never used to particularly like me when I was younger (because I was shy / quiet).
 

 Would it be wrong to simply RSVP 'no'? I feel bad but, I doubt it'd be a massive loss to my cousin either TBH"
"Hi,
 

 I suffer from social phobia, APD and depression all my life (30 now). I never managed to hold a job (or even be healthy enough to get one, really) but I had alot of therapy (since I am 14) and rehab and I started a new job to learn how to become a IT-sys admin. Things are/were really tough and I was basically under extreme stress and anxiety since february (where I started) but I somewhat managed to carry on. It felt like I built up some reserves so I could carry on and on .. since 4 weeks ago.
 

 We had a meeting 4 weeks ago and I had to leave the room puking, several times. Everyone was nice and I got sent home afterwards, but the puking and extreme nausea is still there .. weeks later. I did try to work for 2 more weeks but I just couldn't manage one day without extreme nausea (and puking several times) at work. So I am now on sick leave and I am just ... done honestly. I am so exhausted and it doesn't even stop home. I was at a Dr. and it's most likely not physical (I have GERD and they looked at my stomach 1 year ago). I can't keep ANYTHING in and at this point it's hard to even leave my home. Anyone experiecned something like that? Nausea is something very new to me and I am just totally overwhelmed. I have a meeting scheduled with my psychiatrist on monday to discuss this and how to move on.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 .. and now I need to vent a bit also. I am 30 and I have no driver license, no real eduction (I was good in school back then ..), my fiance broke up with me last year (9 years together) and I feel like I am a complete and utter failure that is about to quit the NEXT thing in life due to just not being tough enough. I also feel like I will never ever find a girlfriend again as I have nothing to offer. 
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 The thing keeping me somewhat alive are my very good friends, my mom and my pets. But shit is really tough right now. I don't even have a real question expect maybe if someone has experience with these extreme nausea? I never had to vomit and now its just part of basically every other hour. I can't cope with it .."
"So this is embarrassing, but became a germaphobe after having my daughter, extremely ppd and ppa, then covid hit, so that occurred. I am seeing a therapist and trying to work through it, but they think its part trauma induced as well. One of my issues is raw meat and my husband cooking. He just wipes things down with water and says its fine. We he said he is making tacos tonight. I see the package has some meat blood already and nervous. He won't let me cook it and take care of it and I need to get over it and quit living in fear and mentioned again water takes care of it and won't wash hands after. Yet, says he is capable of cooking. This is causing me anxiety because I try to talk to him about this and stuff like that and he gets mad and saud quit living in fear. I say other people don't just clean with water and wash their hands. Then I get yelled at to stop and he is going to keep living his happy life and I can join him or not. There is more obviously to all of this, but typing fast and just don't know what to do. I have a 2 year old daughter and 28 weeks pregnant as well, so that adds to stress. Thank you for listening."

"I'm 31M struggling with social anxiety and depression since 10 years most of which is due to my inability to make eye contact with people.
 What things you guys did that helped you out in your eye contact anxiety?"
"More than a handful of times I've been relaxing in my car only to have the person parked next to me or (more often) their kid open and slam their door onto mine. Or a truck backs up into the parking space in front of mine and sweetly kisses my front bumper with their back bumper. Or a shitty parallel parker love taps my car as a gauge to straighten their parking job. Now if I'm in my car, my heart rate spikes whenever I see anyone pull into a spot near me because of dumbass and irresponsible drivers."
"Sorry for long post.
  I have a 2 year old daughter and a boy on the way. I have been with my husband for just over 10 years, but married almost 4. Since I had my daughter, I had really bad PPD and PPA, then covid hit shortly after, which cause other issues. Things got worse in our marriage and of course I am blamed for it all, which causes more anxiety and worsens my condition, especially being pregnant now. I was even told he would leave me if I didn't get pregnant again, then when we found our, he threatened it again and multiple times since. But other times, he's already pushing for a third, when he said if it was a boy, he wouldn't ask anymore. People have noticed that he has become a narcissist, mentally and emotionally abusive, but uses those terms against me. That he is the victim here and has to deal with my mental issues. Yells at me and does it in front of my daughter. I know what I need to do and taking steps in doing so, but scared because I am pregnant as well and feel like I can't do this on my own and have no family here. I am making sure all things are in place before the official file because I want to make sure everything works out, because I know he is going to use my mental illness against me. He calls me worthless, a monster, a horrible mother, etc., many times saying he doesn't want to be with the person I have become. And yes, I am in therapy. He doesn't believe in it and refuses to do marriage counseling and saying things would get better if I fix myself. He is also very gross when it comes to some things like not washing hands or just uses water after changing poopy diapers or dealing with raw meat, thus some of my issues. I try to talk to him about it and get told nothing is on there, he is not gonna change, the world hasn't changed I have and need to get over it, etc. His mom sees it too and won't say anything. I try to talk to her about it, but if course she sweeps it under the rug or says it's just his frustration with me. He now has been starting to throw things as well, not at us, but just in general among other things. I know what I meed to do, just scared, but know my children don't deserve this or need to learn that that is ok to be treated like this or that you treat people like this. Any other suggestions are appreciated as well. Thank you for reading."

"Hi all, 
 

 For years I (34F) have suffered from panic attacks and this usually occurs when I'm in a meeting or when I am having a conversation with someone. It also depends on who I am in conversation with. 
 

 I then feel like I can't leave, that it would be weird if I suddenly said that I need to go to the bathroom or outside.
 

 No one sees at that moment but I just die inside, I can’t hear anything that is being said, I become extremely uncomfortable and feel disconnected from reality. I want to run but I can't, at least, i won't let myself.
 

 My life would be so different if I didn't suffer from panic attacks.
 

 I am taking medication and go to therapy but I am looking for people who might be able to give me some advice, tips, anything…"
"Hi All.
 

 33M here. For the first 32 years of my life, I lived a very low stress/low anxiety life. Outside of the occasional event related stressor, my baseline mood was relaxed and happy. Wonderful wife, healthy children, good job, comfortable finances.
 

 Early last year while working I felt heart palpitations which was a new sensation at the time. Queue up anxiousness. The anxiety elevated the heart rate. I tried to walk it off, but the first-time experience had me convinced something was seriously wrong. Things quickly spiraled into a full blown panic attack. I was sure it was a heart attack and I was a goner. The ambulance brings me to the hospital. ECG, bloodwork, X-Ray. I'm expecting the doc to discuss my heart attack upon walking in, and my hope was that it didn't leave permanent damage. Instead, I'm told they found nothing wrong. I'm discharged a couple hours later.
 

 I sleep from maybe 5 AM to 7 AM that night. Upon waking, I had the deepest feeling of helplessness. I could not reconcile that my thoughts were able to manifest themselves into those physical sensations. I was still convinced there must be something wrong.
 

 In the coming days I got the full cardiology workup done. Ultrasound, two week monitor, etc. Nothing is wrong. I'm in great shape. I run 40+ miles a week. Resting heart rate in the 40s.
 

 After the cardiology workup, I'm feeling back to normal. I was hoping this would all be in the past. But I was wrong. I finish a run one day a couple months later and I'm convinced my heart rate is not dropping at the rate it normally would. Queue up another panic attack. This time I knew the deal and didn't call 911. But it took hours to get through, and the ensuing week left me in a perpetual state of anxiety as the tension during the panic left my body sore, especially my chest, creating ruminating thoughts of heart issues.
 

 These bouts would happen every few months over the next year. A frustrating occurrence, but tolerable. Panic attack, a week of unease, back to normal.
 

 Then comes late May of this year. A long run finishes with a panic attack. Bummer. The very next weekend, same long run. Panic attack. It was milder than the prior week, but it still happened. This was odd because I've never had them in such close succession. The next Friday, 5 days later, I'm driving and start to feel quite anxious. After I step out of the car, another panic attack begins! 3 straight weeks now, something is seriously going on. That Sunday night I make a critical mistake. I decide to try a THC/CBD gummy as advised by other to try and relax. I have never smoked or consumed THC or CBD before. An hour later I'm having the worst panic attack of my life alongside what feels like a complete mental breakdown. Back to the ER for the first time since the initial event.
 

 The following week was the worst week of my life. It put me in a deep state of depression where I checked off every box on all questionnaires besides suicidial thoughts. I lost 10 lbs in 10 days and felt useless. I struggled to find an appointment with a psychiatrist locally, but found an online site that was able to get me going on Lexapro 10mg. I have been on this for a little over 3 weeks now.
 

 Things are improving, but unlike other instances of post panic recovery, I am not back to normal. Nearly every day by the mid afternoon I feel anxiety creep in regardless of if I'm working or if it's the weekend and I'm hanging with the family. By the evening it partially subsides, but there is always a underlying feeling of unease now. I feel happy/motivated/excited much less frequently these days. It's exhausting always thinking about this, always being cognizant of my breathing to try and keep my mood from hitting a higher level of anxiety. I meditate and exercise daily which helps. The heart &amp; overall health anxiety still exists, but my bigger anxiety now is essentially being anxious about being anxious and fearing I won't ever get out of this cycle.
 

 I've read a couple books now which have shed light on the brain and the underlying mechanics to some of these feelings which has helped. I'm seeing a therapist tomorrow for the first time. While I feel I lack daily life motivation, I'm fully invested in what I hope is a recovery back to normal. I will continue to exercise, mediate, eat healthy, see a therapist and invest in my mental health.
 

 While working through the underlying issues, this vicious daily cycle of mid afternoon anxiety increase is my focus.
 

 Any hacks on how to potentially bypass this? I was prescribed hydroxyzine 25mg and clonazepam 0.5mg to use as needed. They both certainly help reduce this afternoon anxiety, especially the clonazepam. But I haven't taken either in over a week as I am trying to avoid building a dependence on these ""as needed"" meds.
 

 Also, should I temper expectations on a full recovery? Is this new way of life something I should learn to adjust to rather than try and completely overcome?"
"Pardon my bad English. 
 No offense to anyone i myself is a very introverted person who is sick of being mocked for my shyness and introverted behavior. 
 I developed social anxiety because of my inability to maintain eye contact in conversations even with my close friends and family. 
 My friends and family constantly mock me for my shy social behavior and inability to talk in I have tried medications and therapy but it didn't work. And i cannot change the people and environment that i live around. I would do anything to become a bit more extroverted person. 
 Is it possible to change yourself from introverted to extroverted person.
 What are the sacrifices i have to make to make it happen? 
 Those who did it share some tips please."
"Hi I’m (30F) new in this thread but very versed in anxiety. My main mental health need is bipolar disorder which I am medicated for, but I think it’s the anxiety that will kill me and I feel like a horrible friend and partner. 
 

 The older I get the more plans I cancel. Tonight I had plans to see a few of my best friends for dinner at one of their houses. All good and I was really looking forward to it. But there was some weird communication and I wasn’t sure the plans or what time or what to bring til somewhat last minute and I was stressed about other things. All of that was not a big deal like at all, yet I went into a complete freaking panic!!! Took a shower, gave myself time to get ready and pick up what I needed. Even meditated today. But then I panicked about my clothes and my mind was going blank and just sat and froze until I eventually would be running late and I just told my friend I was feeling sick and was sorry I couldn’t make it
 

 These are my best friends who are so lovely and supportive but I just have this intense anxiety about even leaving the house sometimes and only want to be with my cats. And I tell myself that it’s an illness and I do feel sick and sometimes people need to cancel plans and I’m not lying. 
 

 I just feel like it’s all going to stack up and get worse as I get older and lose the best people in my life simply because I spend less time time with them when my anxiety + BP is acting up. All my friends basically know I suffer from that but still I just don’t know how my partner and friends want to put up with me 😰
 

 Anyway feeling this??! How do you cope with having to bail on social plans?
 

 Thank you for reading sorry that was long"
"I suffer for general anxiety, is is almost 10 years and I am 33.
 I wen to therapy 2 years but it didn’t help a lot. I have up and downs and basically I learned how to live with it. But recently in one of my down period I have been catastrophizing a lot for every little mistake or impediment happening to me. And it is becomes very very hard to manage my mean gal health and I am feeling more and more depress. I don’t know what to do, so you have any self help book course specifically on Catastrophizing that could help me? I in bed crying all day for the most ridiculous staff that will never happen. While my life should and can be happy if I just stop worrying 😥"

"Update: IDK if I'm I'm allowed to do an update on the situation. 
 My heart hurts today and I have slipped into my numb area that happens when anxiety gets to me. 
 

 I turned my evidence in to my acting boss and she discussed the missed doses with my coworker. Everything seemed to go fine with my coworker. 
 

 

 The owner (I work with animals) had to euthanize the client because she went downhill the day after being picked up and , rightfully so, is now questioning neglect and our facility. 
 

 

 My actual boss is talking to us both individually this week because, as it turns out, missing medications on my coworker's weekend's have been happening consistently over the last few weeks. 
 

 

 I'm so angry. When I think about the events that have transpired I am noticably shaking. My boss group texted us saying""you are both responsible people and mistakes happen. You are both great at your jobs..."" 
 

 

 Now my boss' plan of action is to revise our medical sheets, as if that'll help. The issue begins when the animals get dropped off in her care because she neglects to inform anyone of any medical care and doesn't seem to consistently do the meds herself. 
 

 

 Over the last 3 weeks I've taken it upon myself to double check her work and have caught well over 15 inconsistencies in her work. Given, it's missed bathing schedules and food quantity intake (what kind of owner feeds their 80 lb boxer 1 cup 1 time a day. It's minimum 3 cups a day with any boxer we've had).
 

 

 I hate this and can feel myself cutting my emotions off because of the anxiety I'm feeling. 
 

 

 ..............
 

 I have a coworker who is a bit on the ADHD and lazy or oblivious size. While I don't mind coming in and cleaning up what they didn't do yet should have had plenty of time doing, there are times where lately I've been suspicious that they are being negligent in dosing patients now too. 
 

 

 This previous weekend was their weekend alone to take care of a few patients. I came back Monday to find Friday's meds were given but Saturday and Sunday meds weren't administered even though my coworker said they were. It was OBVIOUS they weren't because the pills were still in their packaging. 
 

 

 There's no way around this. I informed my boss and she said she'd talk to my coworker and see what happened and why they weren't given. 
 

 

 We have a group text and since Tuesday my coworker hasn't said anything in the chat, which they usually do. Yesterday was also their first full year here and my boss always does a congratulations text for work anniversaries. That didn't happen yesterday either. 
 

 

 My anxiety is getting to me. One hand I know I protected the patient, my bosses and our facility from any lawsuit by turning it in but on the other hand I feel a bit responsible if she got fire, quit or written up and my anxiety isn't allowing me to accept this quietness and unknown with the turnout. 
 

 Idk how to proceed in this process."
"I have social anxiety and biggest problem of my life is that i cannot make eye contact with people. It may sound like a silly thing but this eye contact problem is the reason that i am struggling with depression right now. My eye contact is so bad that sometimes I even get intimidated while talking to a kid. Sometimes i wish if i was blind and don't have to deal with all this. 
 I have faced straight out rejections when people came to talk to me and weirded out after few seconds and go away. 
 It has been 10 years since I'm dealing with this. I took meds, tried meditation, took therapy but nothing seems to work.
 People keep saying look between the eye above the nose while you talk but it doesn't work for me as it seems unnatural.
 How can i deal with this when I'm certain that it is not going to get better and I don't even get a chance to accept this thing since i have to meet a lot of people everyday."
"Fairly new to generalized anxiety , I would like to ask if anyone has experienced random bouts of dizziness? What do you do to cope with it? I would be eating dinner with some friends and then out of no where just a rush from my mid back to my shoulders and my head , a wave of weakness and I feel like I am about to lose consciousness but never do. It feels as if something has gone wrong, as if I am not present in the moment but I always try to hide it while smiling and just doing the bare minimum like eating which I feel is not the best thing to do.
 

 I have had checks on my heart via a cardiologist everything was fine (ekg, echocardiogram, stress test, 24 hour monitor, blood tests) I get through these spells by acknowledging that I am okay, and if I were to faint at least there is someone who may be able to help near by.
 

 But it is a terrible way to live and think through all the time. I hope what ever you are going through you do your best to over come it!"
"As an adult, my (30f) anxiety has been worse, especially since becoming a parent to a now 3yr old. In my 20s I would often have nightmares that would wake me up, but I could always get back to sleep. Now I wake up in a full blown panic attack (feeling like I am injured although I am fine, unable to breathe, feeling like there are bugs under my skin and I am excessively itchy, compulsive and uncontrolled speech that makes no sense, racing thoughts and heart rate). After I deal with the panic attack, I have to spend anywhere from two to four hours coming down. This is happening about once or twice a fortnight.
 

 I see a psych but I can't get my ""awake"" time post panic attack down to less than 2 hours.
 

 Things I have tried:
 cold water splashes/shower
 drinking warm water;
 star jumps;
 waking up my husband (lol never again no help);
 breathing exercises; 
 dancing to favourite tracks; 
 lavender oil (ffs); and
 numbing myself on social media/binging tv and snacks because none of the above is half as effective.
 

 Is there anything else people have tried or found effective for them? I really am not getting enough sleep as the kiddo rides before dawn.
 Edit to add: I am not currently on meds, haven't been for a few years."
"Hey, I've been intensely anxious all week, especially in the mornings. This is in addition to prolonged anxiety over the last few months. 
 But I was just walking around eating a slice of pizza when I all of a sudden felt like a strange woosh, kinda like when you jump just as you're about to sleep but not as hard, and I felt like I had to grab onto a table, then afterwards I felt hot and flashy and now I feel like I have pressure in my face. 
 

 

 Anyone else had this after severe anxiety?"
"Anyone with anxiety also have GERD that makes the chest pains worse? Any recommendations on how to resolve or at least minimize the symptoms &amp; their frequency? I’m 34F female, active &amp; overall very healthy. I guess GERD runs in my family. Never had a heart issue or such severe chest pain before… I actually went to the ER bc it was so bad. I’ve also never taken meds for anxiety before btw…Thanks in advance 🙏"

"30/M/180lbs I don't exercise, also super sedentary due to work + laziness. I have health anxiety and lately I've been obsessing over my heart. I wake up often just after exactly 1h30m before i fall asleep. My heart starts racing but I don't feel any fear, it's just my heart beating like crazy and I get around 170bpm and blood pressure is sometimes 132/85 or so, even lower sometimes. On the other hand, blood pressure varies around 156/100 or 151/95 when I have a panic attack. I'm super worried.
 

 GP doesn't quite care, they keep postponing me for around 5 months and every time when i chase them they say the same thing ""Just be patient someone will call you"" lol. 
 

 Kinda tight with money to afford any private heart checks... I don't even know what to check, tried googling but there are a number of em and i don't know which one will be better for me.
 

 I'm a bit lost to be fair, i constantly think about this and that makes me very anxious during the day, but I keep myself busy with random things on my pc.
 

 Currently on Paroxetine 10mg during the day and 75mg Trazodone during the night. Previously at night i was using Zopiclone for 4 months, i stopped then 12days ago to switch to Trazodone.
 

 What do you think guys? Am lost and have no clue what to do next..."
"Well on my way to the er to get evaluated unfortunately feel like I’ve lost control and I don’t want to get to the point where it turns too dark. Very terrified of being put into treatment all irrational fears that are very real to me. I don’t want to be drugged to the point I am a zombie and no longer myself, scared someone in there might hurt me, scared no matter how much my loved ones tell me they aren’t going anywhere that I am about to lose everything I love. Please tell me I am doing the right thing. My brother took his life and I am just scared for that to be my future I just want to be back to my manageable crazy self not this insanely jittery terrified I am going to die and not make it out of this person. Sorry for the rant I am very scared"
"Something that has always crossed my mind but I have never managed to find an answer. Maybe you guys could lend me a hand on this one.
 

 So I'm on medication for Anxiety and I am aware that some may have side effects (dry mouth, constipation etc etc - \[insert side effect here\]). I was always under the idea that if you don't get any side effects in the first 2-3 even a month of medication, then there could no occur any more along the way, let's say after 2-3 months. So this begs a massive question:  
 

 

 Could side effects occur at any given time regardless of how long you've taken that medication or is it/should it occur only within the first weeks/month?"
"Today was very eye opening. After 31 yrs of life I finally tried to get help today for my anxiety and depression. Went to 1 er to be evaluated to only sit in a waiting room for 3 hours and get treated like trash, went to another er who was known for having better mental health and psych help. Finally got brought back to a bed in a hallway after 4 hours of anxiety attacks waiting in the waiting room. Did I receive the help I needed? Nope why? Insurance and money. Today I realized that my brothers suicide couldn’t have been prevented because even if he went for help he would have been turned away like I was today. Because me fighting for my life and fighting to not take my life wasn’t a “medical emergency” because I don’t have insurance. A hospital who has a great 7 day in patient program sent me home mid anxiety attack with a prescription I clearly can’t fill at 3 am. Because “I don’t have insurance and the program is very expensive” the “medical exams and test” they promised me quickly turned into a pregnancy test drug test and a doctor poking my stomach for 30 seconds when they realized I don’t have insurance. Yes I am 31 yrs old I should have my shit together. My alcoholic mother threw out my birth certificate and social security card which is why I haven’t gotten insurance and I was shamed for not fixing that situation in the 3 yrs I was grieving my brothers suicide and literally watching my father slowly die from cancer. my long term bfs mothers unexpected passing, my uncle being killed in a car accident. I am so disappointed and this worries me for so many others out there struggling worse than me. Who would have been treated the way I was today and maybe that was their last reach for help. I will do everything in my power to help others not be treated the way I was today!!Never stop fighting these heartless people may not care but I certainly do! I see you you’re not alone and you matter ❤️"
"Hi!  
 I am writing this post to reaching out people who feel the same way. There comes a point in life when you dont know any better. I am 32 and I have always felt that I cared too much for people, I know it sounds cliche but I loved helping them also expected reciprocity only as human nature.
 

 During recent years in my late 20s I found out the existence of terms and definitions of Narcissim, gaslighting, covert narcissim, psychopath all because of particular examples or circumstances that I faced.
 

 I know that I was conditioned to be a good girl, and so I did become a good girl. which is helping anyone I know going leaps and bound out of my way to help them, make them comfortable, i am not pittying myself.
 

 Sometimes I not want to do anything or nothing for anyone becuase i dont have the resources, but still I do.
 

 Recently i changed my demography and I am being apalled several times how the people younger to me behave. They just dont care about the other person. People lack the basic courtesy. Or am I well trained or over trained and over shooting my behavior.
 

 I want to know if anyone has been on this road, felt like this, overwhelmed and super anxious that sometimes the body trembles.
 

 I just want to stop caring and doing things and maybe not worry what anyone else thinks. I am not an imposter. I genuinely feel for people and take them at face value and naively believe they are nice. But they never turn out to be. And its ok.
 

 I feel the biggest fear of any human is being left alone in life. Any circumstances, situations dealt with or anything are welcome. What is this... Can it be cured? Can it be bettereD?
 

 Thanks!!!!"
"My anxiety is often triggered by sounds and its gotten really bad lately. I'm getting triggered by stuff that never triggered me before. I feel paralyzed by fear. 
 

 I got genetic testing done to see how my body metabolizes anxiety meds because the current one isn't helping me at all. I should have the results in about 2 weeks but the thought of feeling like this for much longer is so disheartening. 
 

 I'm in therapy but only doing sessions once a week and it doesn't feel like it's enough because I'm literally having panic attacks or I'm on the verge of them daily. 
 

 My mental health has never been this bad. I'm 30 and I'm not sure how much more I can hide it from my parents or friends. 
 

 I'm distancing myself from people because of my anxiety. I can't just push through it. I don't know why I should have to push through it..... why can't people just accept me for who I am? Accept me for my triggers? Understand that I don't want to be like this, my brain is just broken.
 

 Part of me wishes my doctor could come to me and say ""there is something wrong with your brain. A tumor it looks like. This is what was causing your symptoms. It's pushing on the part if your brain responsible for emotional regulation. All we have to do is operate and you will be normal."" And then I would have a reason for feeling so insane. It wouldn't be made up in my head. I would have a reason for how I feel.
 

 I'm putting way too much hope in this genetic testing, I know for sure. I just need that one slice of hope to keep me going. Zoloft stopped working, Cymbalta isn't doing anything, I need to know that there is a reason for this and not just years of guessing which meds to try next. I can't mentally handle that. 
 

 My doctor and therapist will ask me ""are you thinking of harming yourself or other people?"" And I always laugh because the unknown terrifies me and that includes death..... there is no guarantee that if there is another life after this one, that it's better. So no, I'm not thinking about dying..... I'm very much so trying to stay alive. I've been through too much to not survive. I just need to know it will get better. I need to know that the future is going to be better. I need hope. And so far all I've gotten are fortune cookie type words of advice. I just need hope.
 

 If anyone made it this far, thank you. I hope you keep your hope alive and that things get better for you."
"(31M)....Every time I try to date things go wrong. Someone says ""so and so thinks you're cute/handsome whatever and wants you to call them"". So I do. Then things fizzle out after a few weeks because we can't get comfortable around each other. I have this recurring thing where women apologize for acting weird or awkward when we're together. 99 percent sure it's my fault because it keeps happening. Guess all I can do is keep practicing and try to be more social but....feels like I'm trying to climb a mountain."
"I’ve (31M) had pretty severe social anxiety for the best part of 10 years. I’ve had moments where I wanted to die. Where I thought I was pathetic and weird and that if anyone really knew me then they would realise all these things to be true.
 

 I started working on myself properly about 3 years ago. It started with therapy. The therapist was ok and helped me a lot but I eventually just stopped seeing him. Eventually I decided to try someone new. This was helped loads and for a while I was ok. 
 

 I would keep falling back into old habits of thought and I still had some times where I thought about suicide but each time I went back to that place there was a growing level of awareness that it wasn’t the whole truth. 
 

 I saw another therapist after this and have considered finding yet another more recently. I have been on medication for about a year which definitely helped certain concepts sink in as it did relieve *some* of my symptoms. I got massively into meditation which has been the partner to therapy for me and without which I wouldn’t be where I am.
 

 I felt many many times like there was no way out. Like I was broken. 
 

 For people in this group who have never been to therapy, never tried medication, never meditated. DO IT!
 

 Try one thing, try it again, try a different therapist (some therapists don’t fit with you and some are just arseholes, but some are amazing, keep looking it is so worth it)
 

 Try everything you can, and try it multiple times. If something doesn’t work, don’t write it off completely. It might just not have been the right time. Wait a while and come back to it. Just keep going. Success is possible.
 

 it is also important for me to note that my anxiety has not disappeared but I would describe it as having found a way to happily coexist with it. I still feel it fairly intensely sometimes but it does not govern my actions and my thoughts. I feel sympathy and compassion for my anxiety rather than frustration and hate.
 

 Tl;dr:
 

 It took three years of trying everything under the sun multiple times over a few years but finally I feel happy and stable. You can do it, keep going. Much love."
So I am 31 year of Female. I am married and my son will be starting Kindergarten soon. I took Driving lessons when I was 21 and never went and got my license after because of the fear of driving I have. I am now 31 and it’s becoming a burden. I know I need to get my license so that if something happens I can be there for my child. But I can’t seem to get past my debilitating fear of driving. Anyone else struggle with this and can help me?
"Hi all,
 

 33M realised I had SA when I was 20 and couldn't click with anyone at uni, pushed friends away and isolated myself after I graduated. My (now) wife has been the only one who ever stayed in touch and we now live together and have 3 kids (forever grateful for). I think the business of our lives has put my SA to one side over the recent years but now the kids are all of school age I find myself facing my old demons. Im struggling to socialise at work and have no friends, afraid to go out and mix with new people, even the other Dads at the school. My wife has been taking up new hobbies and encouraged me to do the same but every time the social aspect of things just gets me down and I shy away every time, getting back in my head again. 
 Any ideas for getting back out there? 
 Thanks for reading."
"Hi all. Early 30s male here.
 

 Last year I started having panic attacks out of the blue after never having any anxiety issues my entire life. Things got bad the past couple months so I was finally prescribed Lexapro, 10mg. I have been on this for 5 weeks now. There has been a slight improvement. Maybe bringing my mood from it's lowest being 2/10 to now averaging closer to a 5/10. Doctor has suggested moving up to 20mg.
 

 My primary issue is severe health anxiety. After 3 weeks of taking this drug, I started developing mild headaches (must be brain tumors to a health anxiety nut like myslef).
 

 They're typically on the top of my head and feel very close to the surface, almost like a mild irritation on the scalp. Pain is probably 2 or 3 out of 10. I notice them maybe 75% of my waking hours. Tylenol does not seem to remove the discomfort. I have been staying incredibly well hydrated thinking that may be the issue, but they still persist.
 

 How long do I stick with the Lexapro and the headache side effects before telling the doc enough is enough, weaning off, and trying something else?
 

 One quick side note. I'm a runner, and have always had moderately twitchy calf muscles after my runs. Whether it's possibly the meds, or just my hyper sensitivity to everything physical now because of the health anxiety, I do feel like these have been slightly more frequent and pronounced and linger around 24/7 rather than just the hours post run."
"I (30F) had an anxiety attack the other day, and had to cancel family events (my brother's bdag today). I didn't cancel the visit my sister and I had planned for a while (my nephew and niece wanted to see where I work), and I was so optimistic because I wasn't totally zoned out. Though, today... I haven't gone outside, I slept almost all day. Am I the only one who experience the fatigue later than expected?"
"I have been given a salamol inhaler, I'm worried about taking it, purely because of my anxiety and panic attacks, will this make my breathing feel weird or will it make me over breathe and hyperventilate or cause my anxiety or panic attacks to become worse my paranoid brain is scared to take the inhaler but the DR wants me to take it to see if my chest and throat issue improves. I hate mental health you worry and fear over every damn thing 😭"
It’s happening. My chest hurts and I’m hyperventilating. I have no one to talk to. Car battery is dead and I’m freaking out cause I’m trapped. I can’t get by. I don’t want to do it anymore please please help
I always lose weight when i have anxiety attacks that last days even weeks it sucks because im already thin so that adds on more stress to me
"so I’m currently in one hell of a funk. Since the start of 2022, there have been some pretty big changes in my life, I left a toxic relationship, my family is moving, my living situation changed, and I feel like I’m not myself right now. I’m so overwhelmed and don’t know what’s coming next and it scares the shit out of me. I know that change can be good, but it’s a huge trigger for my anxiety and I’m just not myself. Can anyone relate? I’m in therapy and have been on/off since I was in my 20s (I’m 32F). Reading, exercising, drinking lots of water, getting outside, writing, have all been huge helps but there’s some days like today where it’s just getting the better of me."
"I'm not talking about panic attacks or anxiety attacks or high anxiety. I'm talking about long lasting physical symptoms.
 

 There are a lot of them but, after decades of living with *anxiety* I can surely say that the worst part is the jaw.
 

 When I was about 23, for time to time I began having some problems while eating. It felt like having my jaw detached or something. If I quickly correct it, it wouldn't be a problem for some time. If not, it can hurt to put it back in its place and can take a week or more. 
 

 After some time I realized that if it happens while I'm eating, I have to spit my food out of my mouth to adjust it. Sometimes it happens around people.... Swallowing our talking or any movement means having weeks of pain, the only way is spitting and adjusting.
 

 Does anyone else live this horrible faith? I can't be the only one. I'm 32 and I've had anxiety all of my life, it happens once every one or two months."
"My husband (m31) has been struggling with depression and social anxiety for about 13 years. It has been getting worse with the years and it’s already starting to affect how he acts with me and our children. He has tried medication and it didn’t help at all well he didn’t stay on them long enough to see improvements. talking to a counselor helped but she dropped him and it really discouraged him to find another one. 
 

 For the passed few months I started to notice that he has become more paranoid then usual like thinking that people are looking and judging him it’s getting so bad that he thinks he’s being spied on like there’s a camera inside our bedroom or there’s people recording us through the windows. 
 

 I just need some advice on how to help him get better I’m really worried at this point."
"Wondering if I'm the only one in this. I see lots of people saying that alchol makes helps a lot with anxiety, at least in the moment of course, but I have always been scared of it. Not because my parents said to me scary stuff about drugs or whatnot, but I was just always scared of that.
 

 I got properly drunk only one time in my life (10 years ago), it happened randomly and was unexpected, I just followed a friend of mine, we had drinks togheter and ended up feeling drunk without even realizing it.
 

 Generally it was a fun experience, a part from a moment where I felt like blacking out/fainting and was still aware of that, I still managed to feel worried about that, I do remember it. Anyways since then I still felt fear of drinking, even tho I wanted to party and have fun I am still scared of it, it's crazy man, I think I'm basially the only one to be scared of alchol..."
"Anxiety and depression are ruining me. It’s been a tough day mentally, I feel exhausted again and thinking of what to do I have no solutions. 
 

 I won’t do anything drastic, I care too much about my family and friends, however I feel like for the rest of my life I will be alone, anxious and depressed and die alone. 
 

 Don’t really want anything, just wanted to express what I’m going through right now."
"And it's the dumbest thing ever. We have these elevators and doors at the hospital that I work at that make the worst noise ever. They always activate my anxiety. So much that I've resorted to pretty much always having my ear plus or headphones in at work. 
 

 I'm waiting for my genetic testing to come back so my doctor and I can discuss which med I should go on so I can have a normal life again. I'm just so frustrated and sick of having these panic attacks daily. This absolutely sucks and I don't know how much longer I'm expected to continue going on living like this....... it's absolute torture."
"I’m(30F)Currently have no close friends or family. I haven’t spoke but to any family members in years. Since my birthday is tomorrow I feel a way about contacting some of them. I don’t want them to think I only want birthday praise. I was in a 6 year relationship that just ended this week. I’m devastated! I’m extremely attached and can’t let go. Being physically disabled does not help the anxiety of starting this new life. I feel trapped. I’ve been trying my hardest to keep busy but the shortness of breath, hyperventilating, headaches &amp; stomachaches are too intense. I need someone to talk to besides my therapist I only see once a month. An audible conversation. Im so confused right now and don’t know what to do. I feel as though I’m drowning. My ex spouse ended up being my everything to me. I really need some more coping mechanisms because running, exercise, familiar movies/shows, well drawn bath, cleaning/organizing, walking around the city have not helped as much as I hoped"
"I (30f) am on medication and doing therapy with an amazing therapist. I eat super healthy and I exercise. I feel like I'm making progress. I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do. Still, I feel my anxiety skyrocketing at night. It's always some stupid shit. Rationally I know everything is OK but I still can't help being consumed by fear. It's been like this for the last 15 years and I wonder if it will be like this forever? Will I become wiser and more experienced and generally better at ignoring these fears? I'm so done with living with these catastrophic scenarios in my mind. I just need to know that the time, effort and money I'm investing in getting better will pay off eventually. I'm so tired."
"Hi everyone, hope your day is going well!
 

 I am 30 years old for reference - Unfortunately since developing GAD I could not seem to tolerate hot weather anything 90 degrees Fahrenheit / 32 Celsius , which is foreign to me as I used to be able to run and be active in the peak of summer.
 

 If I am just walking outside I get really sweaty then start to thin intrusive thoughts about whether I will be getting heat stroke which then leads me to get dizzy and breathe heavy. I do stay hydrated which is the odd part too but regardless I still feel as if I am not.
 

 This has lead me to stay indoor most times the temps are high - but I would like to hopefully enjoy going out and doing simple things if possible right now I just can’t and I feel like I am wasting days indoors when o could be enjoying them outside.
 

 Does anyone have the same issue?"
"I have been suffering from anxiety since a few years, but the latest weeks have been worst. I have an amazing boyfriend but today I had an episode in front of him where I basically got really anxious for a something very minor and cried for not real apparent reason. He was very supportive but he has never experience anything near anxiety and some stuff that he said were very hurtful. Even tought he was trying to help, and most of the time he did. Her said that it didn’t look like I wanted to get better. But I do, of course I do and I am doing my best to do it. For him trying to heal mens rebel and force myself to do stuff even if I am anxious. Like jumping in the sea if I am afraid of drowning. But how, how can I do that if I have anxiety . That is the whole point. Anxiety prevent me to do stuff and the less I do the more anxious I am. But I am trying every day is hell. It even hard for me to get up from my bed. I am afraid he will never undestand me."
"Some of you may be able to relate to my situation, but something tells me that most of you have never heard of anyone quite like me.
 

 I'm 30. I'm a man. I've learned a few things over these last few months that I never knew before, such as;
 

 -People expect prompt responses during conversation and if you are too slow they will think you're a jerk/conceited.
 -People don't truly like it when you smile and nod at them at a distance or during conversation.
 -If you dress strangely in public, you will be treated as such regardless of your appearance.
 

 Many people know these basic concepts but I'm just now learning...at age 30.
 

 It started off simply by playing video games after school each day back in middle school, but over time it escalated into full blown social isolation and depression. I didn't begin to interact with the world really until I was about 18, and even then it was very limited (think grocery store clerks mostly).
 

 As people age they typically learn/develop social skills amongst peers which help shape their future in various ways. I've never had that in 30 years.
 My 'skills' are mostly self taught and definitely wrong.
 

 I've never been in a relationship....even though it's my only goal in life. The only thing I've ever wanted was a girlfriend, and yet I've somehow managed to avoid/dismiss every opportunity I get.
 I'm not boasting when I say this, but I'm very physically fit &amp; quite attractive. Neither being muscular or being attractive has helped me in the least. 
 

 Never had any real friends. Never did anything crazy or thrilling. Never traveled really. Never got a driver's license. Never lived my life basically.
 

 The damage I've caused by isolating my whole life is devastating. I cannot maintain conversations. I don't pick up on any body language or non-verbal cues. This lifestyle was most likely the trigger for why I am bipolar these days. Mood meds don't do enough for me.
 

 Do you know what sleep is? That thing that humans do sometimes? Well my body has been very generous to me these last 3 years by not allowing me to sleep beyond 4 hours each night. During the summer of 2019 I began sleeping just 4 hours each night and then suddenly awakening with unreal levels of energy/stamina. 
 Lately it's been just 3 hours of sleep.
 I cannot physically nap. Drugs do not work.
 I'm not exaggerating....4 hours of sleep max, 3 hours on average. Things sound splendid right?
 

 All of these problems combined with my disorders mean that I'm 100% aloof. 
 Didn't even know the definition of aloof until today, but I just had a feeling that it would describe me....which it does. There is no better word to describe my behaviors/emotional state.
 

  I avoid people often, which makes me look like an arsehole even though I'm simply shy &amp; unsure of the world.
 

 I'm almost blissfully-unaware of the world around me, but there is no bliss here...just pain."
"I (30F) was diagnosed with GAD in my late teens/early twenties. I met my husband seven years ago and I've been mostly stable during this time, save for one or two panic attacks and some bad spells. I was on meds (Citalopram) as well, until about three or four months ago. I reduced them step by step over the course of a few months. Unfortunately, I got pretty sick with Covid at the exact time I fully stopped the meds and I haven't been able to recover mentally. In hindsight, I should have gotten more help the past few months but stupidly, I thought it would go away on its own.
 Anyway, last weekend I had a huge breakdown which triggered my GAD. Since last Tuesday, I've been panicking badly every morning, I'm emotionally and mentally drained, I can do only basic things. I got help immediately and I'm back on my meds now so I'm just waiting until they work again. I'm also on sick leave for the next month.
 

 My husband hasn't seen me like this, ever. He's the stable one in our relationship and he has to pick up the slack when I have a bad time. He's never suffered from depression or anxiety so he has no idea how it feels (his words). I feel like right now, he's trying to uphold a routine and a semblance of daily life, while I'm on the couch or in bed. He still has to go to work, study (he hasn't had a vacation all year so he's drained as well) and cook, he meets friends and watches TV, basically he just goes on with his life.
 

 In between, he asks me how I'm doing. I answer truthfully, but I feel pressured to get better as soon as possible so I can be a worthy partner again, to be able to participate in ""normal life"". He says nothing of that kind and tells me to concentrate on getting better, but I feel like he's not really available for me emotionally. He's very stoic and doesn't talk about his feelings about the situation, except for ""if anything was wrong I would say something"".
 He's never been the super caring type when I've been sick in the past (with the flu for example), but this time it feels worse. He says he just doesn't know how to help and I think this is the way he thinks he's helping most because if he was miserable as well it would be even worse.
 

 Instead I call my mother or my aunt and try to spent some time with them. I feel like a burden to my husband and I feel disconnected from him emotionally. I feel like even if I would tell him what I need, he wouldn't be able to give it to me. I just wish he would tell me that we're in this together and we got this, but it feels like I'm doing this all by myself and it hurts.
 

 Does anyone have similar experiences, and can give some advice? Thank you"
"So I have had anxiety over my lifetime (33M), but two and a half weeks ago I felt a sharp pain in my chest, freaked out about having a heart attack and dying. I ended up going to the ER after I felt arm and neck numbness. Everything came back fine except for HBP and blood sugar, but those weren't alarming levels or anything. 
 

 A few days later I went to my GP and was prescribed Lexapro which I have been taking for two weeks now. 
 

 The thing is I've had chest pains, arm numbness, and facial numbness off and on since that first day. They got a bit better, but I had another attack last Saturday some minor anxiety spikes since then. Is it normal for these symptoms to linger like this? I have a stressful job and some other factors but this has been two weeks of hell. My worst anxiety comes from intrusive thoughts about dying so this has been a nightmare. I am scheduled to see my doctor again on Tuesday, but reading posts here has helped me calm down at times so I thought I'd ask people who have been through it."
"Over the past 4 years I’ve slowly started to develop death anxiety and I can’t pinpoint why. In the last 2 years it’s gotten so bad that I’m constantly anxiety ridden and living in fear. I haven’t really told anyone about it which I’m sure isn’t helping but at this point I can feel my cup about to run over. I can’t live in fear like this anymore (I am not feeling suicidal). It’s debilitating. Has anyone experienced this and have some tips that have helped them? I know I should talk to a doctor or therapist, I’ve just had a really really hard time finding a professional I connect with to talk to so I end up giving up trying to find one that works for me. I literally wake up and try to figure out what I’d do if I found out my parents have passed or if something happens to my sister because she lives alone. It’s CONSTANT. I can’t think about what happens if I die myself, I’ll go into a panic (which happens a few times a day even if I try not to think about it). The unknown afterwards and how quickly you can be gone in an instant from so many random things is truly truly debilitating. I’m so surprised I’ve acted so fine and normal for so long, my husband doesn’t even have much of a clue the severity of it. I’ve mentioned that I think I have it and he’s just unsure what to say, I’m just not sure he can comprehend the severity of it. He sees it more in the form of me telling him he’s been sitting for too long and needs to go on a walk because I’m afraid he doesn’t exercise enough something will happen. 
 

 All I know is I’m just so unsure of what to do, I feel so overwhelmed by this and I never would’ve thought something like this would randomly develop. As I get older the years started to feel so short and I became so uneasy. COVID definitely didn’t help, but this did start prior to then, just more severe since COVID. I have been on anxiety medication before but it had 0 effect on me so I basically just stopped it, doctors weren’t helpful in recommending anything else per usual. I do smoke 🍃 which helps immensely BUT causes me to eat and sleep way too much so that really isn’t an all day option. I am 30 and a female (I know sometimes age and gender can be good to know for suggestions). Thanks for any advice you can give. I’m beginning to become so scared that one day I won’t even be able to go to work I can feel it becoming too overwhelming.
 

 I stay up to make sure my husband is breathing while he sleeps, the list truly could go on and on. 
 

 This also trigger night terrors, I can barely sleep from waking up from nightmares every night of people or myself dying and I wake up with an insane heart rate panicking. Every single night I’m burdened by the worst dreams. It’s so awful."
"I’ve (30M) developed anxiety over the past year and am having trouble with relationships. Do people here have problems with their partner getting angry?
 

 As an example, my ex wanted to discuss moving in but started off the conversation angry “why haven’t we talked about moving in together!?!?!?”, or would say “we need to have a talk tonight” during the day and it would stress me out until the night. Does anyone else have bad experiences with this?
 

 I noticed a lot of women in my life are like this. Eg my sister would yell at me “why the fk did you leave the cup on the bench”, but my BIL would say “thanks doing cleaning, just for next time could you not leave the cup on the bench?”. My mum also yells but then dad would do something similar to BIL. Is it common for women to get more angry in relationships?
 

 I know I need to get used to people being angry, but should I keep searching for someone kinder, or just accept that a partner would get angry at me and may not express that anger nicely?"

"Hi all, maybe a long post but bear with me. I've had generalised anxiety disorder for about 15 years (I'm 34 now), for most of that time I've taken a baby dose of 50mg Sertraline (Zoloft) and it seemingly has helped me. I also have a muscle wasting disease which makes me weak enough to warrant using a wheelchair to get around most places, which I started using late last year. My anxiety has been pretty under control for the last few years, however I recently started a treatment to improve my muscles which involves going to the hospital multiple times a year for spinal injections. This has flared my anxiety quite badly, due to the unknown of using a wheelchair (not being able to get around easily and not being able to use public restrooms) and the nature of receiving these treatments.
 

 Before I started treatments 2 months ago my stomach began acting up and giving me digenstion issues with really loose stools. During this time where I've gone through the treatments my anxiety has gotten worse to the point where I am needing to actually take action again to get it under control. Due to the anxiety increase, I've (under doctor recommendation) increased my Sertraline 50mg &gt; 100mg, and have been given 10mg of Clobazam to go with it to help stabilize me through the transition. I've also booked in with a psychologist, but not for a while yet. I'm handling it mildly okay, however my stomach certainly isn't.
 

 Here's the main part. I'm aware that a lot of people suffer from digestion issues while under stress and anxiety, however I've never had this before the most recent flare up. I'm very certain it's anxiety related as previously when my anxiety died down, my digestion issues eased. I also have no other symptoms. I've been taking loperamide as needed as my doctor says it's fine for me to take. Regarding this, I have a few questions:
 

 \- Does anyone with bad general anxiety day-to-day have digestion issues, almost every day? How do you deal with it?
 

 \- Taking one or maybe 2 loperamide tablets over a few days seemingly fixes me up, but only for a day or so, then my stomach is back at it again with the runs. I'm wondering if there's some kind of a kickback after the loperamide wears off where you'll kinda empty yourself? I'm wondering if I should stop taking the loperamide for a day or two after it wears off and see how I go without it to see if I continue to get the runs or not.
 

 Any advice is much appreciated. Cheers."
Has anyone had success with it? I'm not noticing any change in my anxiety and I'm so frustrated......
"Hi, everyone. I’m new on this sub and have mostly lurked in the past, but here i am. Yesterday I had the worst panic attack I’ve ever had and I’m still rattled by it. This post is more for me to scream into a void and commiserate a bit with others who may suffer from this.
 

 A bit about me. I’m 33F and have a panic disorder and health anxiety. I haven’t had an attack for 1.5 years so I thought I was doing better! I noticed a pattern that these come about when I’m alone for an extended period of time (my partner has been away for two weeks), but this was this first time I had pain in my chest and my left arm was aching. So I called 112 (911 equivalent in the Netherlands) and the paramedics came an did an ecg, which came out fine. No heart attack. They were so sweet and really helped “riding the wave” of the attack.
 

 They said I am under a lot of stress because I told them I’m finishing my master thesis, working 20hr/week for my job, and will be starting a new full-time position beginning of September. Thing is, I don’t FEEL that stressed with all of those things. But it has been a rough week in general because I also had a UTI and a (oral) herpes outbreak. So I cannot help but feel like my immune system is suppressed and something is wrong. I had a complete blood panel done at my doctor 6 months ago and everything is normal (except low vitamin D) and she says I’m perfectly healthy. 
 

 Today, I still feel like I am recovering and feel generally lethargic, have a slight headache, and cannot seem to concentrate on any of my work that I need to do. I’m not asking for medical advice, but can anyone relate? How do you cope? I always need constant assurance that I’m not dying like I believe, so it would be nice to hear from people who have experienced the same. I’m not on any medications except for my hormonal IUD, a multivitamin, and vitamin B12 supplements (I had a deficiency in the past)."
"As a warning, this is a description of my rather disturbing symptom and episodes of panic attacks.
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Fortunately I have panic attacks only about once a year. However when I have them, my mental capacity to make any logical judgement goes bye-bye. Every time I have a panic attack it starts with disorientation which eventually becomes severe. The panic occurs after disorientation, and because of this, I am completely unaware that I am having a panic attack during the entire episode. It includes paranoia and often a flight response.
 

 The 3rd to last time I had a panic attack I was in class at university. I had just finished a test when the confusion and flight response kicked in. I left the classroom, and headed to my car in 30F weather, without my coat on. By the time I got to the car, the panic attack quickly subsided and I realized that I just had a panic attack. I remember the whole thing. Part of the time could not figure out where to go. It lasted about 30 minutes.
 

 The 2nd to last time I was at my brothers' bachelor party in a campground. We camped out for 2 nights. On the last morning, a panic attack kicked in. I hopped in my car and left without saying bye to anyone. Fortunately my ability to drive is like walking, and it was fine at the time. Also fortunate that I was headed home. The confusion started subsiding and I realized I was having a panic attack. I pulled over and called my mom and she suggested I take hydroxyzine. After that I quickly started to calm down. When I was chill I continued home. Again, it lasted about 30 minutes.
 

 The last episode was at home, nothing much happened. 
 

 Ginseng might be the culprit for me. However caffeine isn't one of them. No more energy drinks.
 

 Long graphic stories, I know. 
 

 I'm fine now, no worries.
 

 Anyone else get these kind of panic attacks? I couldn't even find anything similar with a google search.
 

 Thanks for reading."
"Hello, just curious since a lot posts here are from people in their early 20's, are there any older people here? I am 32 years old and have had SA all my life. It isn't crippling like in my twenties but still makes my life really hard.
 

 Meditation and self help books have helped. Did therapy also but my therapist was clueless about social anxiety so it wasn't helpful."
"Not at all suicidal but the anxiety I deal with everyday fearing that I or a loved one could die at any moment from a freak accident, common accident, or health reasons causes me to be a shell of myself. I do really well hiding how anxiety ridden I am to my family, mostly because I don’t want them to worry. It consumes my every thought and if I think about it too vividly I’ll have a panic attack. I genuinely don’t know what to do to get these thoughts and worry out of my head. I need help. No doctor takes me seriously and the amount of effort I already don’t have that I have to put forth to finding another one over and over again is just not possible anymore. Anyone ever get prescribed anything specifically for this type of anxiety and it really helped? I’m miserable."
"I did the genetic testing to find out how fast my body metabolizes meds. I need this to be helpful. My anxiety is killing me. I'm not living my life. I'm stuck in a life of fear, unable to move or enjoy anything. I just want to be happy again. I just want to be normal again. I just want to have my life back. I fear I'll never have an anxiety free life and I'll always be avoiding things to avoid spikes in my anxiety."
Has anyone ever taken hydroxyzine for anxiety? I was given it from the er but the doctor didn’t give it to me while I was there and I’m scared to take it because it’s 25 mg when everything else I was given was only .5 mg. My anxiety has been terrible for 2 weeks now idk how much I can take and the Xanax make me feel like trash
"I’m going through a “flare-up” so to speak with my health anxiety and have had two panic attacks in four days. My partner has been away since the 10th, and being alone makes it so much worse. I constantly think something will happen to me (medically) and no one will be around to help if I need an ambulance. 
 

 It’s a vicious cycle, because I then feel like my mental health depends on others and that’s not fair to them. 
 

 Does anyone have any ideas on how to not be triggered by being alone for an extended period of time? I cannot be constantly surrounded by people 24/7 so I need to find a healthy coping mechanism. Any thoughts are appreciated!"
"So, I suffer from anxiety and panic disorders. I’ve been seeing a psych for a while now, and I was talking about how panic attacks are increasing lately.
 His advice 
 “Based on current evidence the best practice is to just accept the panic attack and don’t try and breathe through it or try any strategies to deesculate it because if it’s a true panic attack, it won’t help”
 

 I don’t like feeling helpless during these panic attacks, so I generally try grounding techniques or something. Just so I’m not sitting there with the world crumbling and being proactive to get through it. 
 

 Is his advice accurate? Am I wasting time? I genuinely have been told forever to try these techniques. It feels so awful to be told in a sense that if those techniques work than it’s not a true panic attack."
I haven’t been able to calm down for more than a few minutes for two days now. I didn’t sleep last night because my heart was pounding. I’m trying to distract myself but I can’t focus on anything. I’ve barely eaten the past two days and I haven’t had more than a few bites of anything. Does anyone have tips for me? I’m on medication but I don’t think it’s working well
My heart has been racing the past two days and I haven’t slept. I can’t eat anything. I haven’t calmed down for more than a few minutes the past few days. I’m so scared. I’m on medication but it’s not helping. I can’t distract myself because my thoughts keep jumping back to anxiety. I’m on the verge of completely breaking down. Help me please
"Hi there. I've been a long-time sufferer of emetophobia that started around my early teens (I'm 34 now). This is a constant struggle but I was feeling generally better over the past 5 or so years. It's been coming back with a vengeance over the past year, however, and I'm not entirely sure why.
 

 **TMI warning for the below paragraph. You can skip ahead to the end if you don't want to read about stomach issues.**
 

 I had a bad bout of stomach issues in November last year but was never actually sick. Part of the issue is that the last time I was truly sick with a bug, I had diarrhea before the other stuff started so I kinda have that association now. I developed pretty bad anorexia for a couple weeks before going sorta back to normal. Ever since then I've had trouble with my eating habits and I know I don't eat properly; I have a lot of starches with some protein and limited fruits/veggies. I drink about 1 cup of coffee a day and that's been constant since my late teens. My doctor diagnosed me with IBS-M when I complained about my irregular bowel movements. I spoke with a nutritionist and after some experimentation she also seems to think it's anxiety related or just IBS, or maybe both. I just can't get through the panic and automatic/invasive thoughts that happen whenever my stomach feels off. If I haven't gone in a few days I get the tummy cramps and gas that you would expect, but it still triggers my anxiety. If something bothers my stomach and makes it upset, I get anxious. If I have a bowel movement that is at all irregular or too fast or whatever, I get anxious. I always end up feeling more nauseous than I probably should right before any bowel movement. I'm sure the anxiety is amplifying it if not causing it.
 

 **End of TMI warning**
 

 My question is how to help deal with the automatic/invasive thoughts. I just started talking to a therapist but it's virtual and I'm still not comfortable talking about all of my stomach issues yet. I'm hoping someone has ideas for things I could try to combat the negative thoughts and try to get my life back. I've tried deep breathing exercises through the Calm app and it helps to a degree, but all the feelings come back once I stop doing it. Is there another technique that might help me cope? I usually know when an ""attack"" is coming as I get a certain aura, sorta like how people describe migraines, so maybe I could do something early to cut it off?
 

 Thanks in advance for your time."
"Hi everyone! I am 33 F from the US and have had bad SA since about 10 years old due to traumatic situation that went on for years during childhood. I am just starting to work on this in therapy, and I am looking for other females age 27- 40 with social anxiety who either haven't worked on it yet or have worked on it and can relate to the struggles and can relate to life experiences being very different compared to other people that don't have SA. 
 

 Preferably looking for those that actually have bad SA or feel lonely since they don't have many or any friends because of this and actually are looking to make a new friend. It would be cool to be text buddies and support each other.
 

 I would prefer if you are in the US. Thanks!"
"So I'm 30 minutes early for my hair appointment. ( I would of been earlier but I was running late 😂) I come here because it's 4 minutes away from my house. I'm terrified of driving, so perfect. So I come inside and sit. Fully aware I'm going to be waiting. The lady goes ""didn't I say 1:30?"" I said yes, I'm very early husband is home so I'm taking a break from my boys"" I heard her tell her current client ""she needs to do that on her time, not my time"" 
 So. I thought I was gonna have a moment. I somehow calmed myself down, texting my husband. I just don't understand. I always feel like a burden. I wanted to ask her to curl my hair at the end. Now I'm probably not. I hate my brain. Thanks for reading. Lmao!
 

 

 Update/edit
 

 Y'all are a beautiful community, thank you for all the kind comments and for letting me vent about something so mild and silly. I'm glad I found Y'all 💜"
I'm so desperate to be normal again. To not have those feeling of anxiety and dread. I want to enjoy life again. Be the person I know I can be. But I can't with this anxiety. I need to get out. I can't keep doing this job or living with my parents. I need to escape. Even the sound of silence is too loud right now because I can't turn off my brain. I just need it to stop!
I always thought I just had anxiety but then started noticing that my anxiety was not the same as everyone else. My anxiety is related to being afraid of the somatic symptoms from fear and anxiety so I try to block the sensations and fight them. Only creating more of the sensations and its a horrible cycle. I feel the urge to block and tense up when the sensations come to try to push them down but I get to the point that I tense up so much and it is not even suppressing the emotion but the urge is still there. my whole body gets tense sometimes and its painful. Its like an internal flinching. I try to let the sensations pass to do some exposure but its like an subconscious action at this point. Not sure how else to describe it. Any advice or tips would help.
"I was at the bar ordering my drink with a younger colleague (Im mid30m). It was her first day. I could choose to let her order and pay first, or offer to order for the both of us. I chose the latter. She stammered “oh no no” like a bit shocked. I became tense. I became super aware that she started getting tense too. Or is it all in my head?
 

 We came back to our seats and she hardly talked to me at all, which got me more tense. I left soon after. I’m still reeling from that awkwardness."
"To start, I’m not going to hurt myself, but I’m afraid I can’t handle my anxiety anymore. I’m on medication and I’m not currently in therapy but I’ve seen several therapists over the years. About 7-8 years ago I saw a psychologist at my doctors office that said I was the worst case of anxiety she’d ever seen. She was an older woman, too. Probably nearing retirement. I live in constant unbearable anguish with few breaks. I’m constantly anxious and for no reason. I already lost one boyfriend who didn’t understand it and now my husband is telling me my anxiety is making him anxious. If I lose him to this too I won’t make it. This all got 100x worse when my dad committed suicide two years ago. I just can’t stand it anymore and I feel like I have no options, almost no one feels this way, and I can’t be cured or even helped of this. I just want the pain to go away so bad that the thought of suicide is becoming a comfort but I’m scared of being in a psychiatric hospital again because my previous hospitalizations felt worse than death. The only thing that scares me as much as death is the hospital. It’s like being in jail and it doesn’t help. Last time there were people screaming, banging on the walls, and threatening to kill each other. I came out of there more traumatized than when I went in. I’m not religious but I’m at the point of begging to god to take this away"
"33f and have been doing well with my anxiety until today. I woke up with an achy pain in my left shoulder joint, like where the upper arm meets the shoulder/neck. I wasn’t feeling anxious but then I decided to google it. I’ve somehow convinced myself that the only logical explanation is that it’s my heart. Everything I read about shoulder pain mentions heart attack, especially the left side. I don’t have chest pain or anything else though, except now when I think about it maybe I’m getting strange twinges here and there? This sent me into an hour plus long spiral of googling stories of women in their 30s and 40s and what they experienced when they had a heart attack. I never really had major heart specific fears before but I am not a stranger to health anxiety. I can’t believe that a brief google search sent me into full blown panic having me convinced I need to go to the ER. I don’t know what to do."
"Would really appreciate some advice as I’m at a bit of a loss and very desperate for help. It’s a long story so TIA if you read it. 
 

 Back in mid October I (33f) got a nasty shock. I started experiencing some tenderness/burning downstairs one evening and decided to have a look. Found some general redness and a small mark that looked like an abrasion. No other symptoms, except possibly pee-ing a bit more than usual.
 

 I had (stupidly) had unprotected sex about six weeks prior to noticing this (with someone I would probably deem high risk, as I later found out he was v promiscuous) which I was already feeling uneasy about — so I immediately panicked and went down a rabbithole researching herpes, 100% convinced I had it. It was my first sexual encounter in 2.5 years so this made it even more devastating to contemplate. I booked the first doctors appointment I could find.
 

 However by the time I saw the doctor 36 hours later, the mark had totally disappeared and I just had residual soreness (though how much of that was psychosomatic, I don’t know). The doctor examined me and said everything looked totally perfect but performed a PCR swab test anyway, and prescribed me antivirals for a week just in case. The swab came back negative (though I’ve read that these are only really reliable if taken from an active lesion). All other STD and yeast tests came back negative.
 

 I have seen four different doctors and been examined multiple times in the ensuing seven weeks. I have shown them photos of the abrasion and 3 out of 4 of them said it did not look at all like herpes, and that it was probably just irritation, friction, or a scratch. One of them said it looked a little suspicious and *could* be herpes — but was not typical and could have been caused by many things. All of them are saying my main problem here is health anxiety and my GP has prescribed me Prozac (which I haven’t started yet). 
 

 I have felt ongoing sensations/discomfort downstairs since I noticed the sore and have been in a living hell, reading about how life ruining the diagnosis is for most people due to the stigma. I don’t know how much of the discomfort is in my head and how much is real, as I’ve been hyper fixated on the area and extremely distressed and anxious. I got a prescription for a few months’ worth of antivirals from an online pharmacy and have been taking one a day in case I have it. 
 

 I desperately want to be wrong but after spending too much time researching and reading on herpes forums I’ve convinced myself I’ve probably got it. I’m petrified my hope for love/marriage is on the brink of collapse and horrified that it would be all my fault — this permanent penalty for a fleeting mistake after a lifetime of being careful. I’ve been too scared to shave, too scared to wear my swimsuit (that’s tight/causes a bit of friction), and scared to get my period because I’ve read all these things can cause outbreaks. Every itch or tingle spins me out. I am not exaggerating when I say it’s been horrific and the biggest personal/mental health crisis of my life.
 

 The advice from the doctors has basically been: you’re fine, move on, get treatment for health anxiety. One of them told me to come off the antivirals (as I could be taking them for nothing) and that way if I DID have it I might have another outbreak and then I’ll know for sure (though again she doesn’t think it’s likely). The thought of waiting for another outbreak that may or may not come to confirm this is awful.
 

 All of them have advised against getting the herpes serology (blood) test, as these are being phased out in my country due to the lack of accuracy/prevalence of false positives and they think it could do more harm than good. However if I really want it, I can get it.
 

 Pros of getting it would be: it might show I am negative, and I can then somewhat relax. Or I find out I have it, and can take myself off the dating market so I don’t pass it on. Cons of getting it are: I could get a low (potentially false) positive (driving me crazier than I already feel with the ambiguity), or a high/definite positive result — and have my self worth and future hopes destroyed. 
 

 What would you do in this situation? Do I just stop the antivirals and hope for the best and try to live with the ambiguity? Do I risk my sanity by going for the bloodwork? It feels my mental health is at major risk no matter which way I turn here. It’s unbearable and I wish every day I could turn back time."
"This really has been the leading part of my anxiety-misery the last 3 years. I CONSTANTLY feel tense. I have barely taken a normal, deep breath in 3 years. Having a conversation is nearly impossible because the tension causes me to have little to say. It kills all my creativity. It kills all my happy emotions. It kills my ability to be in and enjoy the present moment. It causes a near continual dissociation. It makes sex nearly impossible because I can hardly get and keep my dick hard. Feeling tense is hell.
 

 I've recently used bilateral stimulation to lessen my emotional response. Lessen the continuous sympathetic stimulation I was feeling. I had a week where I could sit in silence again. Did not need constant distraction from the immense discomfort I was feeling physically. Then me fearing my bilaterial stimulation work would become compulsive (it sort of became my go to stress coping mechanism) and I would constantly feel an urge to do those movements brought the tension back.
 

 I am so afraid of being tense, that I feel tense. Considering the pure hell it gave me over the last 3 years, no wonder. I don't know how to deel with this fear except to continue healthy bilaterial stimulation/EMDR excersises whilst processing my feelings. Talking about it and clearing my thoughts is the other.
 

 Feeling tense is hell and I'm scared of it. More than almost anything. I fear few things more. It has made me feel so immensely shitty for so long and I really hope the work I do will eventually bring me more life happiness. Where I feel comfortable to start a relationship again or what not. All I want is to be able to relax and be calm again. I miss that feeling. I'm tired of being this way, but I will keep going. I am noticing a slow upward trend, so cheers to that development."

"Hey there. I’m 30F and I have so much in my life that I dreamed of being able to have when I was younger (career, financial freedom, independence). I’m grateful for all of this. However, I’m approaching 2 years of being single and I can’t help but feel increasing anxiety each day that time (and available men) are running out and I won’t be able to have a family or kids in the future. I have been dating a little but not much at all because I travel ~2 weeks/month and the app format of dating just doesn’t inspire me. Additionally, I’m not one who can easily be physical with new partners, so I’m also feeling like I’m wasting my prime.
 

 Do you have any words of advice for me on how to move through this anxiety? Any tactical tips to help me feel more free with dating? I want dating to be a major area that I work on in 2023.
 

 Thank you in advance and lots of light to all of you who are also experiencing your own anxieties."
"I keep leaving jobs due to anxiety and now it is harder to find and land a job.
 I have tried disability and that was a fail because apparently I am not disabled enough. My anxiety is so high right now that I feel I am going to give myself a stroke because I just don't know what to do. I have worked in graphic design, admin, and mental health. I am running out of time to be able to make a life for myself and its Freaking me out.

"Yesterday I started taking Prozac for the 3rd time in my life. 1st fime was in 2020, 2nd in 2021 and now, end of 2022. Each time I felt perfectly fine and didn't experience any side effects except for general numbness and lack of emotions.
 However, yesterday I took the first dose (10mg). I felt fine the whole day, but started feeling very exhausted by the end of it. I took a quick nap, stayed up for a while and then went back to sleep. But I started waking up every hour throughout the whole night feeling very weird and nauseous. In the morning I decided to stay home for the day, but I got these huge waves of nausea hitting me every 30min or so. I felt so so so terrible and it didn't help that I suffer from emetophobia (phobia of vomit). It was one of the worst days of my life anxiety-wise. I don't think it was food poisoning or a stomach bug, because I didn't experience any stomach cramps or GI issues except for that terrible nauseous feeling in my head, chest and throat. I had a headache the whole day too. Ended up taking dramamine and sleeping through the day too. I got a 37.4*C temperature in the evening (99.32F) that won't go down no matter what. Now it's 2am and I'm on my second dose of Prozac, panicking and holding back from falling asleep because Im scared that I will wake up feeling nauseous again. 
 What is happening? Did anyone experience this? Could it be prozac-related or not? Will it get worse? Please help me my eyes sre literally closing but I'm still fighting the urge to sleep because I'm so scared... Shpuld i continue taking it or stop?"
"I (30F) always get terrible anxiety when I’m around any man who isn’t my brother, husband or dad. I grew up with my dad and brother. Mom passed away when I was very young. I experience excess sweating, excess blushing, nervousness, trembling. I don’t know how to control this. This happens even when I’m not attracted. I never know what to talk about and I think they can tell which makes it worse and it just becomes a bad cycle in my head until the interaction is over. 
 

 Any way to help this? What can I do? Any idea what caused this?"
"I've had social anxiety my whole life (33F), but the past 4 years have been so much better. It's mainly because of work. I've been at the same company for 8 years - we were only 15 but then got acquired to 2000! There are offices all over the country, but my location is mostly the former company people. The reason I mention that is because us in the ""core"" group still reminisce sometimes and get together at work happy hours. I'm usually one of the last ones to leave because I'm either chatting or playing a game with someone. I open up, we joke around, and I don't have a huge issue I used to which is becoming red and blotchy when I talk to people. I've been comfy and I like them as people :) 
 

 Well, there's a reunion party this weekend where people are even flying in to attend and I wasn't invited. It's silly for me to feel this way, but I'm pretty crushed. For this to be hidden, they must have created a separate Slack channel to make sure I didn't know about it (office events are discussed in the main one) and made sure not to talk about it when I was around. The reason I know is because my husband is friends with a former co-worker who's in town and said he couldn't hang out because of the big party that day.
 

 Today, I passed lunch room and overheard. One person has a voice that carries, so I heard them talking about it. This was the twist of the knife because now I know that almost everyone in the office was invited, not just the reunion employees.
 

 I used to think that when people were nice they were actually lying and didn't like me. Now I realize that I was correct and should have left them alone and not attended other activities and be annoying.
 

 Btw, there's a way to not invite someone in a way that's less cruel!
 

 1 - ""Hey, this is probably something you wouldn't be interested in but some people are getting together at X."" This is not an invite but a nice way to let me know and not make it awkward when people talk about it in the office after.
 

 2 - ""There will be a party at X, so let me know if you want to stop by."" Again, not an invite but a kind way to exclude someone that you don't want to be there.
 

 It would be bad for everyone , including me, if I were invited and no one wanted me there but it's so hurtful to be deceitful about it.
 

 I wish they would have given me more signs throughout the years that they didn't want to be around me. I don't think I've ever been this embarrassed. I spent years not knowing that I wasn't welcome. It's mortifying."
"Up until 2017 I was a personal trainer. I have never been a stereotypical gym rat. Not really a big guy at all, but I was fit. And I lived and breathed exercise.
 

 It wasn't until 7 years into that career I became depressed and ending up leaving due to burnout. I left that job on a Friday and started a corporate role on the next Monday.
 

 2 weeks later my brother was in a Car crash. A month later from that I found that my father was not really my biological father and he never loved my mother. Life just spiralled downwards from there, I was diagnosed with GAD and started having nightmares about things from my childhood. I lost 3 grandparents in 2 years. My father assaulted someone and maimed them, drove intoxicated and eventually went to jail. I ended up cutting contact with him in 2020 and eventually he killed him self in October this year. There was just so much shit that happened in a short period of time. 
 

 Fast forward to one week ago and I've realised that I've put on 22 kg and I feel like a fat fucking toad.
 I see photos of myself before shit hit the fan in my life where I am smiling and shoot enthusiasm out of my eyeballs. But deep down I look at those photos and see nievity. It reminds of what was to come. It doesn't make me sad because I'm not like that anymore. It makes me sad because it reminds of what happened next.
 

 I'm kind of angry at myself for allowing myself to become overweight. I never thought this would ever occur in my life to this extent but now I'm get anxious just thinking about going back to what was once the happy and safe place for me.
 

 I don't know why this makes me feel so uncomfortable."

"I am 31 years old, female. When I was 24 I went through a rough relationship with a drug addict that lasted 4 years. I was never addicted to this person's choice of poison, nor have I ever tried it. I did everything in my power to help this person regain their life. I was not successful. I did not lose them from this earth but I did separate myself completely and permanently. This was 7 years ago. The 7 years that followed were basically putting my life back together financially and mentally. I am in a very healthy relationship with my forever person now but many hoops were jumped through to get to this point. Countless psych doctors, meds, therapy, ect. Have followed this journey. I have been diagnosed with everything under the sun and thrown bottles and bottles of pills. No relief, ever. I suffer with severe stomach ulcers so I have decided to come off medication all together. The side effects make it all worse to the point I can't function on them. It's simply too strong for me to take - and I've trial and error more than I can count.
 Symptoms:
 Uncontrollable anger
 Inability to finish an 8 hour shift if my anger/anxiety gets to be too much
 No sleep for more than an hour or so at a time
 Racing thoughts
 Zero confidence
 Overthinking myself to the point of destruction 
 Inability to understand day to day conversation because my brain does not perceive social cues like they should which leads to arguments that are usually just misunderstanding
 Zero patience for the general public 
 Zero interest in day to day life, I have no hobbies. 
 More often than not I just want to be asleep.
 Weed is the only thing that has proven effective because it gives me the ability to actually sit down and stop pacing the floors. 
 I'm scared I will eventually lose my will to live and the list of what is actually worth sticking around for is getting smaller and smaller. 
 The general population gives me zero desire to be a part of it. Even small talk with people in a grocery store usually doesn't go well. 
 

 I'm not a mean person, i used to be very social but now I will do just about anything to avoid it. Exposure therapy is not the answer. 
 

 I'm looking for people who are experiencing things like this in hopes I can get pointed in the right direction. 
 

 With 6 different doctors and 6 different diagnosis I honestly just don't trust the medical field anymore and doctors are unwilling to spend time talking to me for more than 20 minutes before they throw pills at me. Therapy has proven to me Parrott like. I say how I feel, they reword it, hoping I'll come up with an answer and I have run out of patience for that. I do not have insurance and to be frank, I'm just happy I had enough to get food in the kitchen this week. 
 

 Does anyone have any idea of what these symptoms might actually be? I know there are some really great medical professionals on this site. 
 

 The phrase ""am I too immature to handle this world or is 31 years of human bullshit and ignorance met my bullshit meter"" crosses my mind everyday. 
 

 Thank you for reading, I appreciate all the help, tips, or advice anyone is willing to give. 
 

 Side note: meditation and self care are not answers I'm looking for. After 3 years of practicing that I'm still at square one. 
 Thank you."
"I have social anxiety, severely around men but are women also, just not as bad. I think I am a boring uninteresting person. I don’t really have a problem with it, I enjoy my life. However, when it comes to conversations with people I have difficulty because I don’t really know what to talk about. 
 

 I don’t have any hobbies. I like to watch shows and movies, listen to music. I work in a medical office with small staff. I am married. I enjoy concerts. I don’t work out, don’t collect anything, don’t read. I am not creative at all so not artsy hobbies. I don’t dance (have two left feet). 
 

 I don’t think there’s anything particularly interesting about me. I’ve made my peace with it, just have difficulty conversing with others because of it. I am quiet unless I’m really really comfortable. I don’t really share my opinions unless asked directly. I’m still not comfortable around my husbands family and its been 11 years. I love them they have been understanding and accepted me but I still feel uncomfortable. 
 

 I am currently in therapy but I thought- why not hear what reddit has to say? 
 

 Any ideas of how I can connect with people more? Thanks in advance."

"I'm concerned about COPD, and other progressive lung diseases. I smoked a pack every 2 days for a small period of time a long time ago, I am in my 30s now and havent smoked since. I noticed that within the last year or so, when I breathe deep (and am laying on my back) there is a vibration or rattle at the tail end of my inhale, a very obvious one. If I lay on my side, stomach or am upright this does not happen. I also dont have symptoms of breathing issues either. I don't have asthma, haven't been sick, etc. 
 

 Has anyone else experienced this phenomenon? Google displays sinister causes (as most lung issues are). I am concerned and am going to get it looked at but am worried in the mean time. Anyone have experience with it? What it was?"
"The title says it all. I'm struggling. My social anxiety is out of control and I live in constant fear of everything. The thought of leaving my house makes me want to throw up, and yet I still have to do it. I have a three month old son who is absolutely beautiful and perfect and thriving, but with that obviously comes having to be in social situations every now and then. I've ALWAYS struggled with this. My mom has a video of me in kindergarten during one of those Christmas singing things where all the kids stand in front of a huge audience of parents, etc and sing and what not. In the video, I'm backwards and facing the wall the ENTIRE time. I did not turn around once. I remember that day like it was yesterday. I'm 33 years old. I can't make phone calls. The amount of anxiety that brings makes me feel like I'm going to have a heart attack. I prefer to email or text, but for whatever reason, that's not good enough for most people. Even though, that's the only way I'm able to get my feelings/thoughts out! I freeze and my mind goes completely blank when I try to make phone calls. I. CAN. NOT. DO. IT. I try to explain this to people and they still refuse to accept or even try to understand it. I hate feeling like this. I wish so badly I was a social person. I wish I had people who listened and understood me and supported me as I am. My life is a total mess right now and I'm so afraid that I'll revert back to my old ways.. I won't, though, because my son and his well-being and happiness is number 1! But my brain, man.. the disassociation has been unreal. The brain fog and the going blank and the chest pains and the sweating and my face turning bright red every time I try to talk to someone is killing my soul. I just don't know what to do. I NEED to be back on my medication but my doctor is being weird about it. I was on Clonazepam for 15 years until I moved, and even then, I drove the two hours to see my old psychiatrist and get my meds every 6 weeks to month and a half, for over two years, until he left the practice. I never abused them. I took them AS prescribed, always. And now because of whatever stigma, they will not prescribe me the medication that I NEED in order to function. I'm taking several other meds but my anxiety is NOT being managed and it's NOT under control. I turned to drugs when I first lost my psychiatrist.. it was the ONLY way I could control these feelings and feel normal for a while. I've been sober for over 15 months but my god, I've never felt worse. I don't know how much longer I can take this. I can't even do therapy BECAUSE OF the amount of anxiety it brings me - I literally can't think of anything else every single day that leads up to the therapy session, it controls every single thought. It doesn't help me. It makes things worse. Some people just NEED medication to help their brain function properly.. it's like any ""other"" illness that requires meds to control it. Of course everyone is different.. I've even told my doctor id be willing to come in DAILY and take the medication in front of her AND do daily UA's, if I could get the medication that I NEED. Why are the bad decisions of others affecting whether or not I get the medication I NEED? I never abused it.. I've always taken it AS PRESCRIBED.. I'm willing to jump through all of these hoops to get it but it's never good enough for anyone. They'll always label me an ""addict"" when all I've ever done is try to control this overwhelming anxiety that controls my every thought/move and is slowly killing me. I never would have turned to drugs if I still had access to my medication.. anyways.. I needed to get this out, and I needed to feel heard by someone that understands me and my feelings and what I'm going through. If you read this far, thank you. I'm happy to be in this group, I feel less alone knowing I'm not the only one feeling this."
I’m looking for anxiety related stories in books. Not self help and guides to deal with mental health issues. Only stories and novels where anxiety or any other mental health disability was a big part of it.
"I've been in a pretty rough spiral with my health anxiety for roughly 5 weeks now. It seems like I can't recall squat. For instance, the other day changing clothes I took my phone out and put it on my dresser (I guess) then 10 seconds later saw it there and had no recollection of doing it. I've been doing that a bunch here lately, doing some minor action (typically something like flipping the headlights on in the car) then having no recall of having done it. I'll drive somewhere and a minute and a half later I will have forgotten some small section that I know I had to drive down! However, I'm constantly distracted.
 

 It doesn't help that my health anxiety hang up is on early onset dementia. Even though I'm only 33 the fear of it consumes me. It seems like every time I have a good couple of hours something comes up and sets me off again. I don't have a doctor, but I did ask my nurse practitioner and she seemed fairly unconcerned but I'm always afraid I didn't tell her enough.
 

 I had my Lexapro upped and got Buspar added as well. It seems like it's helped some but it's still rough."
"So I'm 32 and a single mum with 3 kids. 2 are on the spectrum. I always thought I was even before my assessment. But I recently had my assessment completed and now I'm officially/clinically diagnosed autistic with ADHD and my lovely companion PTSD diagnosed when I was 20.
 

 Its validation for me and it feels like a weight has been lifted.
 

 But how do I tell my family? My nan who I'm very close with is very old school. Doesn't believe in autism or anything like that. Even when I visited with my daughter and she was struggling with her autism needs, My nans standard comment was oh she is just been naughty, you need to be firmer with her. I don't think she would accept it or be supportive. Everyone is getting diagnosed with autism now comment.
 

 My mother I couldn't care less what her opinion is and we already disagree on well everything.
 

 My half brothers would probably just brush it of and be like okay if you say so. Not have an opinion either way.
 

 It would mean a lot to me for her to be acceptive and I know I cant change people."
"Hi guys, I'm 30 from the UK and have suffered with social anxiety for the last 4 to 5 years, the last year had got so bad that I started missing work because of it, doctors put me on ssri meds (setraline) which made me 10x worse, This time last year I diddnt leave my bedroom for Xmas, I couldn't even face my own family as I couldn't make eye contact, I would sweat, shake and stutter and even have brutal jaw pain. This was really strange for me as I'm a very social person, love my football and also run a dj music event which I travelled the world meeting new people. So I found it quite bizzare as it came from nowhere. The last few months I would wake up crying just dreading the day ahead of me and having to socialise and my negative thoughts running wild. Even going to the shop to get something would turn me into a mess.
 

 I never understood anxiety and depression in the past , but after what I'm going through I always said if I ever get through this I want to help as much people as possible, fighting demons everyday is a true battle, and I'm happy to be here, taking it day by day 
 

 I have spent around 5 grand trying different therapies and methods to try and get through this and I'm going to share with you all what is helping me at this moment in time 
 

 1. Somatic therapy (breathing into the sensations) 
 

 Only been doing this for 3 weeks and it's been an absolute game changer for me. I would close my eyes and picture myself in old scenarios where I would get really anxious , your brain still thinks it's real even tho your imagining it . I would then breathe into it through the nose and then give it a big sigh through the mouth as you exhale, after 4 or 5 times the sensation would of gone. Then think of the scenario again , if the same sensation is still there work on it , or other parts of the body that you will feel it triggering , until all the sensations are gone . This is honestly amazing stuff 
 

 2. Microdosing mushrooms 
 

 Im also microdosing the stamets stack with is 0.2mg of shrooms, 2000mg lions mane (tablet form) and also I'm doing 50mg vitamin b3 l. 4 days on , 3 days off ! I have been doing this for also 3 weeks and together with the somatic breathing I feel amazing, I feel more alert in conversation and I'm pushing myself to do more social things, also my megative thinking has decreased massively 
 

 3.Meditation and supplements
 

 Im also meditating twice a day , started off doing 10 minutes a day , now im doing 10 minutes as soon as i wake up, then 10 minutes at bed time. Also I'm taking the following supplemts 
 

 Vitamin D
 Magnesium 
 Turmeric and black pepper 
 Fish oil 
 

 

 The change in me over the last 3 weeks is madness, I am nowhere near fixed , but trust me guys I have gone from a nervous wreck that is wanting to commit suicide , to a stage where I know I can beat this ! Any questions you have il be more than happy to help anyone !"
"She asked me if he was the one teaching me to drive and proceed to ask him aside to tell him everything that failed me during my exam. It was so humiliating, honestly. Like a child being scolded by their parents. I'm 30. She was very strict and said I drove in the middle of the road and my stops are incomplete (which were never an issue the other two times I failed my test). I will try again but I'm so upset about the whole chat with my husband thing."
"Hi everyone. I have a lump in my lower back (left side) seems moveable. It’s not painful or ever bother me, I just tend to get nervous about it and I start rubbing hard and irritating my skin. Could this be a lipoma? I googled and it said liposarcoma now I’m scared. (34F)"
"I was just prescribed strattera for my adhd which I’ve never taken. I’ve been prescribed adderall and vyvanse in the past which worked for me, but I’m a recovering drug addict. Even though stimulants weren’t my DOC, it still worries me. Also it’s hard to really get prescribed much of anything at all once they see that in my chart. It seems like a lot of doctors immediately dismiss anything I say and just chalk it up to me being a drug addict wanting drugs. In my experience anyway. 
 

 It’s taken what seems like for fucking ever to find non-benzo anxiety meds that halfway work for me and make me feel ‘stable’..so I really hate adding a medication that I’ve never tried. Any other anxious recovering addicts have any similar experiences? What adhd meds work for you? Any recovering addicts that take stimulants and don’t have issues? 
 

 If this is a stupid question my bad, haha I’m just trying to make good choices for once and it’s hard man damn"
"my anxiety is so bad that watching TV or playing games or doing anything in general is next to impossible. my mental health has ruined my life the minute I was born so much I got bullied in ever school year, left school at 15, never dated and still a virgin BTW, I'm 32. making friends are hard cause of my fear of talking to people excepti attract people who black mailed me dpread rumours abd beat me up and threaten ne with knifes cause its funny to do that apparently. I have weird personality i get very hyper around people worse when online with people i feel like im annoying and people just put up with me. I managed to get my HND in IT but barely passed due to my mental health and once again had several people throughout the 5 years had several people threaten me think it's due to my hyperness l. after college I ended up getting so bad I've not been outside in 9 to 10 years now so now I have agoraphobia, anxiety disorder, panic disorder, neurodivergent and spd there's something else there but don't think my mental health care team are going to try diagnos me im being tested for autism second time well they're trying to get me a second test as they're set on me being autistic."

"For a few months now, if I take a deep breath while laying on my back I feel it in my left lung. Feels like I need to clear it out. I do a little cough or clear my throat it at won't do it anymore till a while later. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this or what it was?"
"Last night I (F32) was attempting to fall asleep next to my boyfriend (M40) when I had the weirdest symptoms come up; racing heart, sweating, shaking, sense of impending doom or death, increased saliva, and increased breathing. 
 This lasted for around 30-45 minutes before I was able to fall asleep.
 

 I have a history of anxiety disorder but I’ve never had an episode like this. I usually have panic attacks which last up to 5 minutes. I use medical cannabis and an SSRI to assist my symptoms. I did use my medical cannabis around 1-2 hours prior to bed. 
 

 I attempted to use different methods to calm myself down such as looking at my phone, walking around, reaffirming that I was safe, reading, an EMDR technique, and looking at objects around the room and thinking about how I got them. Nothing seemed to work. I didn’t wake up my boyfriend as he had to get up at 6am and it was already 2am. 
 

 I am going to talk to a walk-in clinic doctor on Monday (they are not open in my area on weekends), but I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. And if you have had a similar experience, have any recommendations to help calm yourself during these episodes.
 

 Thank you!"
"I have to stay alone for sometime absolutely and some how its the first day and i cannot stand it. Does anyone feel some kind of fear or jist not wanting to be alone?

"Hello I am 34 year old female suffering from anxiety and depression for years. For longest time now I have been able to go on with my life somehow functioning with behavioural therapy. Now 8 Days ago I came down with covid and the flue in the most brutal manner. I haven't eaten or been sleeping for the past 8 days and I am already underweight. On friday a tooth which was formerly root canal treated over a year ago started to hurt as well. The dentist did not help because I was still positiv so I should take 3 1000mg amoxicicillin. I am really anxious about meds since the only things I have eaten in the past 8 days a bit of rice, applesauce, some cooked carrots and crackers. After fighting since friday today i just took half a pill after eating some cooked potato and carrot (3 spoons worth) and It made my stomach feel really bad. Here is the thing: I was even contemplating just self admitting into a psychiatric facility BUT since I just had covid they told me they would put me into a closed station because thats the only way they can isolate right now an described it as an extremely unpleasant experience. It seems like I am really running out of options of what I can do and I do not have anymore tears to cry. I have ativan here which I never took and I am extremely scared of side effects especially now with the antibiotics I am supposed to take the next dose soonish. I really dont think I can manage to take any of those pills now and even if worse come to worse and I put myself in the mental health facility then I would still suffer from post covid and them not being able to treat my toothinfection. I maybe could manage to try to take the ativan after tryng to eat but would it not be dangerouse not continuing the amoxcicillin after only barely managing to take 500 mg earlier today? I am not sure I can handle more nausea I really am at my breaking point and It seems no doctors or anything can help me anymore because of this fucking pandemic situation. what should I do reddit? It is just so hard with the anxiety and being dehydrated and starving."

"Hello, I'm not sure if this is allowed so please delete if it's against the rules.
 

 For the last 3-4 days iv been feeling a constant urge to always need to deep inhale, once I do I'm content however about 10 mins later I feel I need to do it again and this goes on through out the day. I feel if I'm distracted I don't feel the need and it's more only when I'm fixated on it which I feel like is all the time at the moment (feels like I'm stuck in a vicious circle!)
 

 Anyway, when I googled (which is number 1 do not do 😂) it mentioned anxiety. Iv never suffered from anxiety before so was wondering if anyone here had any insight or can relate to something similar?
 

 Just to add I'm a 34F non smoker non drinker, not on any medication, all in all perfectly healthy! 
 

 I plan on speaking to my GP tomorrow just to check my oxygen levels"

"I don't mean feeling your lungs inflate, I mean when you press your hands/fingers around your sternum/heart area and breathe in deep/quick--- can you feel a subtle vibration or a woosh? Like you can 'feel' air flow through your bronchial tubes? Just wondering....."
"So, obviously, I struggle a lot with social anxiety. I'm normally good at masking it and pushing through, but I've had a very rough few months with my mental health and I'm only just starting to feel comfortable leaving the house to do basic errands, let alone socialising. 
 

 I've been invited to my SILs hens party. Of which I'm supposed to be paying $100 for the privilege to attend.. right before Christmas.. while Im currently unemployed.. (but that's a different issue). 
 I want to be able to go and celebrate her. But just the idea of having to sit around all day with a group of girls I don't know makes my blood turn to ice and I feel like vomitting. Its ridiculous. I'm 31 years old, I shouldn't be feeling like this. But I don't feel like I fit in with these people. I had my other SILs hens last month and it took a massive toll on my mental health. I don't want to put myself in that situation again. 
 

 I know that my SIL and my in laws in general don't understand social anxiety or my mental health struggles. So how do I get out of this without upsetting anyone? I can't chuck a sicky on the day without wasting $100 (which I really need right now) and I really don't want to hurt anyone's feelings 😔"
"I'm 33 and have had health anxiety for about 18 years. The severity changes depending on my situation but it has never gone away. I have worked with a few therapists, I like my current one but my symptoms have stayed about the same. 
 

 Since I became a father and my child has been really sick a few times my anxiety shifted to her health and that's 10X worse.
 

 I do my best to hide it from her as I do not want her to end up like me but I don't always succeed in doing so. 
 

 Currently she is sick and I am sitting outside of her room listening for her cough and I'm physically shaking. It feels like I've been thrown into a dark tank of water with sharks and no way out. (Which in these scenarios is unfortunately all too common.)
 

 Just having a thread like this to write on is great, it doesn't solve my issue but it helps me to feel a little less alone."
"I'm debating asking my doctor about starting an anxiety medication like Lexapro, but I'm not sure if my anxiety is bad enough to justify what I hear are pretty rough side affects.
 

 I (30M) for a long time have suffered from anxiety related to big events (job interviews, tests, etc.) specifically sleeping before job interviews is futile and I often go in a nervous wreck. I'm interviewing now so this is top of mind...
 

 I also have other general anxiety symptoms that have worsened since the pandemic and working from home for the past 2+ years. This usually manifests in stomach problems. If I am leaving the house for something and I know that I won't be near a toilet, or I'm getting my haircut, etc. I often feel like I have to take a shit right before I leave but can't. It took me a long time to realize that this is just plain old anxiety.
 

 I also have high blood pressure which I'm beginning to think is also related to me being anxious (especially when I'm at the doctor).
 

 I'm at the point where I could easily be convinced to start Lexapro, but I'm pretty terrified of the side-effects, particularly loss of sexual function.
 

 Anyone else have similar experiences?
 

 TL;DR. I definitely have anxiety but it is not completely debilitating (no panic attacks). Are the side effects of SSRIs worth it?"
"I don't mean feeling your lungs inflate, I mean when you press your hands/fingers around your sternum/heart area and breathe in deep/quick--- can you feel a subtle vibration or a woosh? Like you can 'feel' air flow through your bronchial tubes? Just wondering....."
"I find that when I lay on my back after a while and breathe super deep through my mouth, it feels like my lungs are congested. It feels like a mild vibration in my chest and happens a few times a night. It just feels like I am breathing through mucus in my lungs for a second and then goes away.  
 

 I'm not sure if this is not uncommon cause I have no asthma or breathing issues, and I just noticed it randomly recently and have been constantly doing deep breaths since to see when it happens so I am not sure if I am exacerbating a relatively normal phenomenon through testing/coughing or is this is a bad sign of lung diseases? I am 30 btw."

"Hello everyone,
 

 

 I (31m) am, inadvertantly, always smiling when talking to other people. The subject or the circumstances don't matter, I'm smiling, even if something sad like a death comes up, I struggle wiping the smile off my face. I already can't remember a time where I didn't behave like this. Though most people like this about me and maybe even feel at ease seeing me always smile, I don't enjoy it. Not because I'm always sad or something like that, mind you. I wish to only smile out of genuine happiness, affection or laughter. I'm tired of gifting my smile to every random person for free. I want it to feel special for the people I hold dear and for myself. I'm aware that this behavior of mine is most definitely a result of my childhood not allowing me to remotely look unhappy or displeased, for if I do, bad things follow. No worries, I don't need this behavior anymore. I'm independent and otherwise alright.
 

 

 

 I'm writing this because
 

 

 1. I want to know if my fellow sa sufferers had the same thing happen to them.
 

 

 2. Maybe someone can give me a new perspective, or just a bump in the right direction on my issue.
 

 

 TY for taking your time reading this post, kind stranger. Good day to you."
Possibly because I'm 33 n have upper dentures.. I get so self conscious.. This is only started like kind of recently I've always been pretty normal about them but now I feel like they're just noticeable as fake even though I know nobody's really looking I'm super self conscious and God forbid I talked to a girl for long enough to crack a big enough smile to Where they could possibly see the color difference between the top and bottom and then they would surely know right lol we drive ourselves crazy with this shit.. The human mind is so interesting. Even 2mg klonopin doesn't really help it..

"I have a pretty severe history of social isolation and social phobia that got a lot better throughout the last decade (now 33F). Now the first time in a situation where I am stable enough to actually go outside, and try to make friends by myself. I even found a wonderful new partner this way.
 

 I challenge my negative self beliefs (im not interesting/entertaining/smart/funny etc enough) by putting myself out there. That is I meet up with people and try to talk to them about my life and to share things I did or saw or what I feel or just stuff that’s going on with me. A lot of the time many people just react by saying “okay” and that’s it and that literally leaves me feeling so dejected and concluding like why did I even bother to talk to them in the first place. Like I put myself out there and if this is all I get what do I do it for because in the end I’m the one sitting there, feeling shitty about myself because of this.
 

 Sometimes, when I feel happier or more confident, I think I interact in different ways and then I don’t think I care much what people think or I also think they react differently to me so I don’t know if it’s just the way I project my insecurities on other people, or if my conversation style is weird or if there’s something wrong with me? And I am SO incredibly frustrated by this and I need to fix it. Because its just making me want to isolate again.
 

 Like I do my best to react normally, and to have actual conversations or dialogues with people when they tell me about their lives, but it never feels mutual. Even with my boyfriend, he generally encourages me to talk and wants me to share what is going on, but I never feel like there is a normal conversation coming out of it or maybe I’m just currently generalising because I feel like shit about myself…
 

 I have one or two friends with whom this isn’t an issue and with whom I generally like to talk because I feel there are actual conversations happening that I am involved in rather than just being a sounding board for the other person, but I just don’t understand why it has to be so different. Any advice/idea? :("
"It's really weird for me. If it's not too much , I'd like to give a bit of a backstory.
 

 I'm 30 now and hat my first panic attacks when I was 20. It pretty much started when I was smoking weed and I felt like I was having a stroke or something. Laid off the weed, anxiety and depression stayed. Life-changing.
 

 Now I've been able to manage it better now, I'm never in true fear of dying anymore and I can control myself a bit by breathing, but what's grating is that I never feel panic attacks coming. I think I'm relaxed and out of the blue boom. Rarely happens anymore but yeah. There's no way to prepare.
 

 Also what's way worse is I just get anxious symptoms throughout the day in the form of body sensations that just worry me. For example numb/or tingling sensation in body parts, tinnitus, pressure and stitches on various spots of my brain/skull, suddenly feeling like my head is on fire. Why the FUCK are so fucking many symptoms of anxiety and panic disorder associated with symptoms of strokes and heart attacks? It's driving me fucking nuts, why can't I get a runny nose or something like that.
 

 Anybody else? Pretty sure I guess, but how do you cope?
 

 Tldr: can manage panic attacks, but they still feel random and weird body sensations happen way more frequently than panic attacks themselves."
"I've tried many times in the past to do just this and it's always fallen thru or I get sent in the wrong direction. And as much as I need a therapist to talk to, I need answers.
 

 

 Today I'm hoping to finally get an evaluation to see wtf my brain chemicals have been doing and I've been trying to mask thru.. masking thru has made me such a different person that im done with this. I hate not knowing who I am. What's going on in my head. Friends don't see me. My own partner doesn't know me anymore. I can't handle this. I'm SO hopeful but I'm also nervous and trying not to talk myself out of it or psych myself out...
 

 

 I have ADHD, depression, diagnosed generalized anxiety for most of my life. But everything plays off each other.. there is a chance I could have undiagnosed OCD or bipolar and as scared of that reality I was... Give it to me. I rather know and try to work forward then keep trying to pretend. It hurts so much to pretend...

 UPDATE: My partner took me to a local mental health clinic that takes walk-ins. The lady I saw was painfully neurotypical and kinda just gave me very obvious cooping techniques.. but I also got an appointment with a CBT therapist which is one of the things I did want to start. 
 

 Only downside is the soonest appt opening is in February... That's so mfing far away... But it's a start 💕"
Anyone ever have a stressful sleep? Like not good quality of sleep and feeling anxious the whole time . waking up tense and on edge.

"I don’t know where to start with my background but I’ll start to make it as short as possible. I’m 33F and been struggling with general anxiety disorder my whole life. One of my main issues is that I get overwhelmed incredibly easily by sensations (materials on my skin, the feeling of sunlight, etc) getting tasks done, time management, travel, work, pretty much everything feels daunting even activities that I enjoy. This has led me to try to cope many different ways: anorexia, bulimia (over 14 years), drug use, compulsive shopping, cutting, etc. I’ve dealt with agoraphobia (couldn’t leave my place for 2 years) and I sometimes still feel frozen in place when my anxiety is extremely high. Unfortunately, throughout life I have dealt with trauma that has made my anxiety worse (got hit by a car, rape, assault,) Covid also heightened it as well. I also deal with SIBO, chronic body pains, fatigue, taking care of my mother with delusional disorder. I have tried therapy out since I was 13 (CBT and DBT) and it has not helped. It has gotten to the point where therapist itself makes me feel panicky. I’m trying out EMDR but haven’t gotten to the EMDR part and I’ve rescheduled many apts due the getting panic attacks at the thought of talking to the therapist. I have tried countless medications. The only med that worked for me was Topamax and the only reason it worked was because it NUMBED me out, it numbed me to the point where nothing affected me that much. I didn’t put on a dress and feel as if I wanted to scratch my skin off because it squeezed some part of my skin or the material felt wrong. I didn’t feel as if the world was ending because I had to do multiple stuff in one day. Sadly, it stopped working a few years ago and I’ve just been trying to ride the anxiety waves but at some point it gets too much that I lose it and go back to the bulimia. I try to ride it out for as long as I can, then I try to distract and after a while (I can usually last for weeks) I succumb. Why is it that only numbing helps? Is there anything else I can do? I’m in my 30s now and I want to be more productive in life and not so miserable…"
"So slowly I'm starting to think I might be stuck in a near-constant dissociative state. Especially when I'm so in my head, fearful and overcome with feelings that people will attack me, judge me, or humiliate me it's like the world is not really there.
 

 I can see it's there, but sounds are muffled. My vision is like I'm stuck in sort of a soap bubble. I can touch a wall, feel it, but it just doesn't feel like it's really there. Is this dissociation and what causes it? Does anyone experience this?"
"I won't go into details but I worry about things which may happen in future even when I will be long gone .I worry about future catastrophes ,global warming , pandemics, possible death of the universe after billions of years and extinction of the humankind after billions of years ....It is very recent anxiety .
 

 Like I worry that future generations will suffer a lot and everything even our pretty earth will end one day 
 

  I want to stay optimistic and think bright ..like... look science will make life much easier for people and maybe, just maybe future generations will have happier life than we had .maybe scientists will create something to avoid heat death and who knows maybe we will be traveling to different planets ....look I can choose positive mindset but no my mind will jump to the worst scenario 
 

 please reply if any of you had similar fear in the past? what helped you to stay in the present ? I will appreciate all your comments"

"I always imagined having romantic feelings for someone would make me happy and cheer me up .so recently I met someone who I genuinely like and seems like finally my feeling are reciprocated ...I always imagined that ( I know i was very wrong ) having someone like him would instantly fix my anxiety ,cure my phobias and I would be anxiety free person ...but seems like the opposite happens
 

  I really like him but I still deal with depressing thoughts and severe anxiety ,even worse now I worry that ,,what if after he finds out how severe my anxiety is he may leave me and choose a girl who is more fun and advantareous "" which makes my anxiety even worse . He knows that I have anxiety but I do not think he realizes how severe it is ...since we are just getting to know each other and we live far away ..
 

 I am afraid that he may reject me for speaking up about my irrational phobias and fears ! and this feeling makes me feel even more anxious .I am afraid that he may not be supportive when i go to therapy ...how do I deal with this anxiety ? how do i communicate with him about my fears without becoming a burden in his life ?"
"I (30f) always had tons of friends at every stage of life. But I didn’t keep up with most high school friends when I went to college. And I went to college far away and when I moved back after and all my college friends stayed there, I lost touch with most of them.
 

 I tried to get back in touch with people from my high school group when I moved back to my home town several years ago, but coincidentally only the guys from the group came back, and when they all started settling down they drifted (I don’t blame them, it’s weird when you’re in a serious relationship to be frequently talking to and hanging out with another woman). 
 

 I had made a new group of girlfriends when I moved back, but over the years it became increasingly apparent that one of them is very toxic and catty, and I realized for my own mental health I needed to distance myself. 
 

 Now that I’ve stepped back from them I’m looking around and am just like… well crap. I have no one. How did I allow this to happen? I’m trying to make new friends but at 30 it’s near impossible. I have a lot of acquaintance type friends but they all already have their close inner circle very solid so I’m never going to get any closer than that. 
 

 I feel like I’m going to be lonely forever. And I’m constantly having physical anxiety symptoms over it."
"I have a severe anxiety and I realize that I need a help .the only problem is that I live in developing country and the only option to find a therapist is to go to the capital city( which is 5 hr away from my home ) which means 
 

 1)I should quit my job and start everything all over . 
 

 2) I hate the city and felt always all alone there which I think will make my anxiety even worse 
 

 3) I have no idea how to find a good therapist since therapists I have tried before were 1) religious people who tried to fix all my problems with religious quotes 2).not experienced but friendly .\_\_\_ .I have found a good professional,old lady , but felt like she was judging me for my actions did not feel very open around her but she was much more experienced than other therapists and I trusted her more despite her vibes ( bc she seemed smarter than other therapists I visited ) so I am confused what do do ..
 

 4) I feel awful after every therapy session so being all alone in far away city sounds like my nightmare..last time I tried it i left the city and quit therapy because I could not do it all alone  
 

 5) I do not think online therapy is an option because I do not trust a therapist (what if she records me )also I am never all alone at my home

"Every time I recall my anxiety attack and ask myself ,,why did I freak out ,what could be the worst scenario'' the only answer is that : ,,well if i freak out ,people will judge me harshly ,they will think that I am crazy and something is wrong with me ''
 

 I would never ever judge anyone for having anxiety or panic ,even more I think that people who will judge me just bc of my anxiety or panic are idiots ...but why do I care so much what people think of me ?( well,I live in super conservative country and my upbringing style was overly critical but still... .) even after reading so much about anxiety ,why am I so ashamed of having panic attack and anxiety ? it is like I have a dark secret and I am hiding it from other world ...I know many people have this feeling .my logical mind knows that nothing is shameful about anxiety and it just means that maybe I am strong person for dealing with it ....but subconsciously I still deal with unexplained guilt and shame ...

"To say that I hate myself is an understatement. I honestly cannot remember a time when I looked in the mirror and was happy with what I saw. I was never abused by my parents or mistreated. I come from a large and loving family. I just can never seem to be enough. I've had my fair share of trauma in my adult life, but it was all self-inflicted:
 ; always being pulled to broken people and situations. I'm 31 and I'm tired of the constant barrage of intrusive and ugly thoughts. I've noticed my 10yr old beginning to exhibit some of the same isms that I have and I'm afraid that I have somehow passed this monster on to her. We do daily affirmations, accountability and emotional check ins with each other and she excels in school and gymnastics. But still sometimes i recognize the sadness in her little face and I feel helpless. I don't want her to struggle through involuntary holds or being given the ""medicate or kill yourself"" ultimatum that has plagued my life forever. I also don't want her to have to bury her momma in this way. I want help that actually helps. I've been consistently taking my meds for a year and I'm still having crippling bought of depression and anxiety. It seems like it's impossible to find someone who is willing to see through every past misdiagnosis and see ME. I've done all that I can on my own and I'm losing this war. I've even set a death date to look forward to just so I can get daily life. 12/31/2030...

"I (F31) have been going to school for Fashion Design but have been so overwhelmed and so stressed that I've lost more than half of my hair. I have a tendency to have avoidance when I'm stressed and stopped doing homework till the night before, causing me to stay up very late and not sleep much. I'm taking 5 classes and working part time and I'm tired. Emotionally and physically. I take medication for my acute anxiety and it's helped some but I think it's all just too much. 
 I decided that I am starting to spiral in a direction that I don't want to go down again so I contacted my school 2 days ago and told them that I'm going on a leave of absence. All that night I went through deep depression. I felt relieved but guilty at the same time. I have amazing parents that completely understand and support me in every direction and decision I make. I know that not as common as it should be. And that helps a lot. 
 Getting to the point, yesterday morning I sent message to an instructor that I felt connected to and showed interest in helping me in my career and told her that I was taking a break. She responded immediately and asked me to call her! She said that she was actually happy that I was because now that I'm not longer her student she is going to start introducing me to some designers and getting my name out there. I cried. Then I called my parents and they cried with me. I'm so happy. 
 So long story short people, just cause one or 1000 doors close, doesn't mean there isn't another door around the corner cracked open. I am trying to remind myself that everyday. Love you all."
"I have PTSD and have been trying to re-enter the dating world. With drinks being the standard for dating in big cities these days, I indulged in a few last night. Drinking always makes me feel unsafe and especially so if I’m with a stranger of the opposite sex. Now, a day later, I’m feeling intense anxiety right now with heavy pressure on my chest. While I am safe in my apartment, I can’t help but feel hyper vigilant and scared. I know I’m stupid for having had drinks when I knew I should avoid them, but can you please remind me that this will pass and i will feel okay? Do any of you ever feel this way too?"
"I feel like I may be a narcissist. I try not to be selfish and I try to taje every opportunity to help others that I can. But.... I also find myself subconsciously keeping score. Especially with my husband. I thoroughly enjoy going above and beyond for him and he is always quick to show his appreciation. But.... I also tend to throw how much I do for him in his face whenever he fails to meet me in whatever panic driven mania I find myself in and move at double time when I do ask him for anything.I feel like I am really self centered when it comes to him. I expect him to be readily available to entertain my whims but fall short ob engaging in the things he's interested in. How do I rid myself of the narcissistic attitude/ behaviors? How do I save myself the heartache of knowing that I am the reason I lose a wonderful, brilliant man?"

"so ,I have general anxiety since 18. I also deal with claustrophobia and mild agoraphobia ...( which I can manage more or less)
 

 It first started several years ago when the ceiling of my room literally fell down in several minutes ..luckily i was not asleep first thought was ,,what if it happened when I was asleep .'' Probabaly i would not stay alive ..after that I kept staring at ceilings in my collage classes but eventually I got over it ...
 

 This fear hits when I feel very stressed or when I try to face my fears.right now I am reading self help book and I feel huge anxiety about earthquake ..( even though earthquakes are not common in my area ) it still gives me huge anxiety .It does not help that my country has buildings which are quite old and recently tragedies like these ( buildings collapsing suddenly happened) ..Did anyone had the same fear ? how did you overcome it ? 
 

 I feel like walls are closing in on me ...and I won't be able to escape.I cant get therapy right now bc of distance from my therapists .any suggestion would be appreciated"

"srsly. this is my biggest fear ever when I think of panic attacks ( I usually get them when I have irrational fear \_ for example fear or earthquake ) I always think : My fear is irrational ,maybe it means that I will go insane or people will find me insane and I will end up in mental hospital .
 

 Mental hospital is very scary place in my country and the shame and taboo associated with it makes my anxiety attack even more severe. ..I know that panic attack does not mean that ,,I am not ok'' but irrational fears make me feel scared."
"Long story short, 've struggled significantly with anxiety for about 12 years now (I'm 34 years old) and it's gotten progressively worse year after year. I don't really experience depression symptoms often, but I experience moderate to severe anxiety on a daily basis. In addition, my daily quality of life has declined significantly due to an ever-increasing amount of physical health issues I've been having. These are everything from:
 

 \- IBS  
 \- headaches  
 \- bladder issues  
 \- Chronic body pains  
 \- constant heart palpitations  
 \- shortness of breath  
 \- dizziness  
 \- blurred vision  
 \- brain fog  
 \- chest pain  
 \- body shaking / jitters  
 \- Insomnia and waking up in the night  
 \- lump in throat feeling  
 \- limb numbness  
 \- and probably more I've forgotten.
 

 Most days I wake up and begin experiencing many or all of these symptoms as soon as I get up and they persist all day. It's been the biggest barrier to getting through the basics of my day (work full-time, raising young kids, enjoy life, self-care) and making the lifestyle changes I need to potentially improve the issue. It's awful trying to get through a workday or spending time with my kids when you're having noticeable chest pain, or feeling like you're going to pass out and having blurred vision. (among all the other things listed!)
 

 I've been working with doctors for some 10 years trying to figure out my health and the WHY. I've seen more doctors and specialists than I can count. I've had countless blood work, tests, imaging, etc. I've worked with mental health therapists, psychiatrists at least bi-weekly for the past 5 years (minimum). I've tried a variety of SSRIs and SNRIs (all with negative results). Not only have I not found any improvement for my symptoms, essentially every health provider has said all my physical health symptoms are anxiety-driven. Nothing else could be found from all the testing and specialist visits I've done. My general doctor strongly feels all my issues are caused by my weight (36 BMI) and my mental health. I don't necessarily disagree, but it's been hard to make lasting changes when I feel so darn terrible every day!
 

 I guess my question is.... are all these physical symptoms on such a regular basis normal for anxiety? Part of me feels like something has to be physically wrong with my health, but every test is like NOPE, it's just your anxiety. I've been desperate to find solutions that could help me feel a bit better on a daily basis so I can make lasting changes, but I'm just not finding it and also concerned my physical symptoms are something going missed. Any thoughts or sharing your experiences are appreciated. Thank you!"
"That’s what is Southerners say when we worry about things that haven’t happened yet. I am the poster child for borrowing trouble (32F).
 

 I will go an entire day worrying about something like work or family because I constantly feel like I’m a bad person. It gives me anxiety and thus, I’m paralyzed.
 

 Now, I have learned that step one for me is identifying it and asking myself some questions:
 1. Does what I’m worried about need immediate attention?
 2. Are there indicators to say that I am a bad person or made bad decisions?
 3. Whose voice do I hear when I feel this way?
 4. What are the consequences of what I’m afraid of?
 

 Would anyone else like to add their thoughts or add to the list? Thank you in advance!"
"Hi everyone. It's my first time posting in this subreddit. I (34F) have always had really bad anxiety from the time I was very young, particularly in situations where I feel ""trapped"", such as school and now work. Once I feel comfortable at a place I can function pretty much fine, but because the adjustment period is so hard for me and takes forever, it's difficult for me to end up at a job where I can even reach that point. I have a history of finding a job and then quitting within a few days of starting, which is terrible.
 

 My last job I was at for about 5 years, but last month I ended up leaving very abruptly and unexpectedly. I also moved back in with my mom in December which has me feeling like a failure. I got a new job right away in the same field I was in before (childcare) and started last week. I wasn't very nervous about starting on the first day, but adjusting to a new school was way more uncomfortable than I thought it would be. Every day that first week was harder than the day before it, not easier. It got to the point where I was just crying on my breaks and after work, and finally on Friday I was holding back tears during my entire shift. This entire weekend has been a total nightmare. I've basically been having on and off panic attacks since Friday, dreading the thought of going back in. I've barely been able to eat. I threw up this morning and called out sick.
 

 I've made the decision that I need to meet with my boss and talk to her about going part time temporarily due to my stress and anxiety. I know that if I don't do this, I will end up quitting. All of my managers are very nice and I believe they will let me reduce my hours, but I feel like a total piece of shit. I've only worked there for one week and I'm essentially going to have to tell them that I can't do the full-time job they hired me to do. 
 

 I know that this isn't forever and that once I find my footing it will start getting better, but god this sucks so bad. When I'm comfortable somewhere I do just fine, to the point where these past few years at my old job I was really thinking to myself ""wow, I fixed myself and I'm fine!"" but the joke was totally on me because I didn't fix anything and now I'm back at square one. Starting therapy later this week, I really hope it helps. I'm so fucking scared that I'm going to have to do a slow ease in to every job I ever have for the rest of my life in order to function.
 

 Any kind words or commiseration would be really helpful. Thanks."
"Ok so I will start by saying I’m 34M with a history of panic attacks in college. I have had a few since but nothing on the level of the one I experienced the last few days. Ok so I worked really hard at work last Tuesday. Sometimes after a hard exercise I will experience tightness in my chest and not able to get a refreshing breath. Woke up Wednesday with tightness. I figured it was from the work but that night as I was watching TV the panic attack hit. I have had them before but usually I get a tight throat during the episode and this time it’s not there. It was one of the most intense I’ve had. Every day since that initial attack it feels like someone has a hand around my heart and is squeezing (not really painful, more like just pressure). I also still have a bit of tightness but I’m able to get a deep breath but I have the feeling to take another almost immediately after. At first the pain in my chest felt like a cramp from running but it was on the left side of my chest right around where I assume my heart is. Now I am super aware of any sensation in my chest and the pressure on my heart has not really subsided in about a week. It’s not so much painful and just a strange pressure. I am super terrified that I have a heart problem but everyone I talk to assures me it was just a really bad panic attack and I may feel the pressure for several days but it hasn’t ever happened before. When I used to get the panic attack in college I could breath in and out a few times fast, take a deep breath and blow into my fist and once I breath in again, it would usually stop. Needless to say this hasn’t worked for me this week. I have had about 3 or 4 intense attacks since last week. I have searched the entire internet and can’t find anything anywhere about anyone who has had this same issue and every place I look says anxiety pain is more sharp and heart attack feels more like pressure and I am very scared. Any help would be greatly appreciated. It seems to get worse when I sit down and think about it. I worked all day today, landscaping (digging holes etc) and felt fine. Still feel the pressure but have not really panicked. Last attack was last night. Thank you for listening"
"I want to clarify upfront, I am not asking for diagnosis. I am seeing a therapist since a month, once every week. I have breakdowns once or twice a week, feel like time is running too fast very often. I often lack willpower to do daily tasks during the days i get breakdowns, I feel because i feel tired. I also sometimes wish that my life can just end and it will be easier than living. I thought it is just because of stress at work (I am applying for other jobs to switch my workplace, hoping to do what I like more will reduce my stress and give me happiness). I am also on very low dose of Zoloft almost since a month. Last week my therapist told me that I need to see a psychiatrist as I have panic disorder and need better treatment. Is she right? Do i need to see a psychiatrist? If this is a wrong question to ask this in this subreddit, I apologize in advance. I really am looking for advice."
"I am 30 and I am extremely shy and have a lot of social anxiety. I am scared to tell my coworkers that my brother lives in the US for fear they will google him. He lives in the same city as my companys headquarters in the US. He did a phd in his field and he would be easily searchable. Scared they will judge me and say he is rich for example because of where he works. He has a very top position in his field. I am also scared of them finding it weird of why i have not shared this with them before. 
 

 I am also nervous of sharing with people the high school i went to as it is a private school. I am scared they will judge me as wealthy for havkng gone there. I feel really guilty of being more well off than my peers 
 

 Does anyone have any help? How can i stop worrying so much what people think of me? I am seeing a therapist and i started taking medication.
 

 Any advice?"

"I can’t really tell anyone because if I did all my friends and family would be disgusted and horrified by me. 
 

 I am 33F and I hadn’t been to the dentist in 12 years. Each time I wanted to make an appointment…I would just have an anxiety attack. I have spent so many nights over the last DECADE worrying about my teeth rotting out. And of course, the longer I waited the worse it became knowing my mouth was only getting worse. 
 

 Well, I did it! I called a dentist on Monday and they had an opening today. Got my X-rays, exam and cleaning done. I told the front desk, hygienists and the doctor how nervous and anxious I was and they were all SO FREAKING NICE AND GENTLE with me. 
 

 And no cavities at all! 
 

 Shoutout to all the people in the dental field who don’t shame people who can’t keep up with dental health!"
"Hi Everyone,
 

 Just sharing my personal experience here, but drinking alcohol on antidepressants makes it harder to gauge how much you've actually had to drink because it lessens the effect sometimes. Alcohol and medication in general is not good for your liver, but alcohol and antidepressants can make you go ""hmmmm"". Be careful- I had to temper my alcohol use after I realized what was going on. Alcohol also renders these medications ineffective, which means you are likely to have *more* anxiety the next day. If you're on antidepressants, avoid it or use with caution. Nobody tells people this and I think people should know. 32F."
"I wake up every day to the same thought.. Kill yourself.
 Meds don't help
 Weed isn't an option because I'm pregnant
 Each day it becomes harder to ignore. I've been in this place before.

 I don't have that level of fight in me anymore.
 Yet I have so much to live for."
"Since I was 17 (when my mom died) I've been on various anti-anxiety/depression meds. I'm 31 now. Ive never been diagnosed with anything and I think that's partly due to where I live, the mental health care where I am has been incredibly difficult to navigate. After my brother died a couple years ago it took 4 months to find a therapist and as much as I hate to say it, she was terrible and couldn't tell me anything that wasn't already obvious. Like no insight I guess? I had a really great one for a year after my mom died but she is long retired. I recently had a phyciatrist which was a miracle to find and he wasn't even local but he quit after a few months. So needless to say, it's getting more obvious that I have issues and it's like a game of Russian roulette trying to gain some insight or find a predictable pattern. I've settled on GAD/SAD and possibly bipolar? The one thing the psychiatrist did say was I probably have a binge eating disorder and maybe some ADD? But never an official diagnosis. I feel trapped in my mind and in the last couple years it spills out onto those I care about. The look of pity or ""not again"" is also perpetuating the cycle of self hatred. I think about terrible things happening like earthquakes and I have a full panic whenever there is one. I have been totally locked into an overthinking spiral. Something my coworker said, that would seem harmless to anyone else has been so invasive and I've thought about it all day today. I'm constantly churning about upcoming things. Like getting my tonsillectomy, my relationship, getting a dog, cancer (which I've had in the past), what people think of me. I feel very loved by my best friend who is also my coworker but I can't stop oversharing my thoughts and feelings. She's so great about it but I know its too much. In the last year I've also started having little micro- outbursts when I get overwhelmed by something and I'm sure it puts those around me on edge. I never used to be this way and I hate it. I'm in bed now just circularly bouncing anxious thoughts in my head and it's causing physical chest tightness like I want to crawl out of my skin, scream, kick, cry. Everything is overwhelming. It's clearly anxiety but I just feel like I need something. Im getting a huge complex that the people I care about are getting tired of me. It's like I'm on the outside looking in and I can't stop it. I can't stop worrying or fixating. Or wondering when the other shoe is gonna drop. Im exhausted physically and mentally and can't to basic life tasks half the time. I've had a lot of trauma but I also feel well rounded enough to be ok with that trauma. I feel like it would be viewed as just an excuse anyway if I bring it up because it's jarring. Im an open book but I don't like people to feel bad for me. I can't stop feeling like people think I'm just a flaky, awkward, anti- social stress case. I'm likeable but I worry it's because people feel bad or something. I dont know how to navigate this but I feel broken. Outwardly im caring and make people laugh. I'm just a shell. I don't want people to tire of me. Thanks for listening."
"I am 30 and I am extremely shy and have a lot of social anxiety. I am scared to tell my coworkers that my brother lives in the US for fear they will google him. He lives in the same city as my companys headquarters in the US. He did a phd in his field and he would be easily searchable. Scared they will judge me and say he is rich for example because of where he works. He has a very top position in his field. I am also scared of them finding it weird of why i have not shared this with them before. 
 

 I am also nervous of sharing with people the high school i went to as it is a private school. I am scared they will judge me as wealthy for havkng gone there. I feel really guilty of being more well off than my peers 
 

 Does anyone have any help? How can i stop worrying so much what people think of me? I am seeing a therapist and i started taking medication.
 

 Any advice?"
"Over the last few months my anxiety has gotten increasingly worse and panic attacks have become quite frequent. I've noticed one of my biggest triggers is brightly lit, noisey,crowded places. I start to feel exposed like everyone is looking at me (I know this isnt true) and my fight or flight response kicks and I just want to get out. If I cant escape the situation my heart starts racing my vision goes blurry and I feel like passing out. I'm currently in therapy working on it but I'm flying home (Canada to Australia) solo in the next few weeks and Im already dreading the airport. Does anyone have anyt tips on how to combat this?"
"About six weeks ago (New years eve) I had a some wort of panic attack relating to my health that has lead to me having dizziness and heart palpitations/strange feelings in my chest since then. I've been checked out with a full blood panel, EKG, and 48 hour holter monitor - all coming back clear. I started on zoloft and it has helped with the mental part of my anxiety but not yet with the physical symptoms. 
 

 Prior to this I was on a weight loss journey and was exercising often. With the dizziness and chest flutters, I've stopped since I'm nervous something is wrong and exercise will lead to a heart attack or stroke. But if this is truly just my anxiety, I need to start exercising again. Especially since my anxiety is worse in the morning which is when I was typically working out. Any advice or encouragement? 
 

 I also noticed today that my heart rate is pretty low (50's). I looked back on my data from my health watch and I guess its been that way for months ---- does anyone else have this?"

"So I basically deal with general anxiety and claustrophobia
 

 but despite my fears I always try to get dental treatment asap,the only exception is when I need anesthesia. I remember when dentist gave it to me first time I felt like my throat was closed,I could not breathe ...I got huge panic attack .( I do not have any allergic side effects it was just psychological) Unfortunately seems like I will have to get anesthesia again and I already dread my visit ....I live in developing country so my dentist does not get my fear.Even my friends do not get it
 

 How can I convince my brain that whatever I feel is just sensations and nothing dangerous will happen to me ? how do you deal with patients like me ?
 

 p.s I asked my dentist to give me lower dose of lidocaine ( since I am thin ) but he laughed and refused ..I guess he is right
 

 How can I deal with this terrible fear of numbness and choking /not getting enough air sensations?

"I am 31 years old, I guess I've always known I have anxiety, but only minor things like feeling insecure and analyzing a lot of things, it never interfered with my daily life that much though. However, this tuesday something that's never happened before occured. From basically nowhere I started to get cold sweats, got an annoying pressure in my head, feelings of dread and a weird feeling under my chest and this haven't disappeared since. I constantly google what's wrong with me and that doesn't help at all (I know I shouldn't but I'm stupid). I'm scared that I'm going to have a panic attack, or if I already have one, I just don't know. I've talked to my girlfriend and parents about this and it helps a bit but I think I'm going to try to get a doctors appointment on monday. I'm not sure I can get through this weekend feeling this way though. I'm basically wondering if anyone can relate and could give me any tips how to deal with this until I see the doctor.

"Do people recognize this? I constantly feel the need to be perfect, to live up to a standard that society sets for me. That there is an 'ideal' way to be and everything else is useless and disfunctional. It gives me the feeling that I constantly need to strive to be perfect, and if not I am facing dire consequences. I suspect it comes from being bullied in my childhood. Not being perfect, not living up to the perfect standards the other kids set for me, had really bad consequences for me. 
 

 I see the world in a black and white now. My fear of being bullied, abandoned, ostracized is making me want to control everything, understanding everything. Everything needs to have a purpose, be usefull, otherwise it feels pointless to me. Things need to have a meaning, but the more I think about life, the more I conclude there is no inherent meaning to life. Nothing to strive for, there is not point to it. I don't know how to deal with it.
 

 Do people recognize this and have helpful tips?"
"Sorry, I (32M) tried to make this short, but it didn't work, and I know it might also sound like a lot of pointless worrying.
 

 We met on online dating a month ago. We're both poly. They (29NB) live a few hours away. The planets haven't aligned for us to meet. Through some... whatever the opposite of a miracle is, they lost their job the day before we were supposed to, and due to the extreme stress and financial problems, they'll have to delay it until they find something else.
 

 They're totally aromantic and looking for an FWB situation, which is fine, as we wouldn't be a good fit for a relationship due to wild lifestyle differences and I have no desire to fall in love with them, ever.
 

 But we've texted every day since we matched, done hours-long phone calls and VC's, made each other laugh a lot, flirted all the time, talked a lot about our lives, had Zoom sex. We've had disputes, but always worked them out quickly and they've been nice about everything. We share a bunch of favorite kinks, so I've never had any experience on online dating more fun and sexually fulfilling, and I've overall never been so excited to meet someone from an app.
 

 In short, ain't trying to get hitched, but I think they're rad as hell and hope we can eventually be close long-term friends (with benefits).
 

 Yesterday I told them not this, but that they're the person I talk most to on a daily basis and I feel pretty close to them already, and I value the connection. They responded that they care about me and I'm not disposable or anything: It's just that I'm attractive and fun to talk to, but that's the extent of how they feel about it, nothing deeper. I didn't take it super-well (not *badly*, in that I didn't get angry or anything, just showed that I was hurt and emotion-dumped) and there was a tense convo where they explained that it doesn't reflect on my worth, they simply don't desire or have the emotional capacity for anything deeply meaningful, especially while they're going through the job shit, and want to be casual friends.
 

 As usual though, they were as nice about it as they could be while still being blunt, we made up, they said it's NBD and in the past now (just that they can't be the one to handle my anxieties for me right now, which is true) and we're on speaking terms again, although it's left a bad taste in my mouth, so I've cut way back on texting. Interested in seeing if things are less icy when we talk on the phone or VC again, assuming we get back on good enough terms to.
 

 So, my rational side says ""Dude, it's been *one month* and you haven't met. If anything, their position's the normal one. If y'all are still talking in a couple years, presumably visiting each other, and they still insist we'll never be close, then yeah, that'll be fucked. But for now, just chill, distance yourself, focus on talking to other people, don't emotion-vomit on them again, and *learn some goddamn patience.* Nothing is being asked of you.""
 

 But my emotional side has rejection trauma, a pattern of falling for avoidant people, and panic-anxiety disorder, and it's hurting. It's flashing back to previous times I was dumped way more brutally, telling me I'll never mean anything to them and we'll never get close no matter what happens, and they're just going to toy with me for a matter of weeks or months before ditching me - in fact, they have a Reddit account, so even though they've never posted in this sub, don't know this alt's name, and the odds are microscopic, they'll see this, they'll recognize me, and they'll never talk to me again *oh god oh fuck*.
 

 I already know my rational side is an absolute lad and right about what I need to do, but the hard part is fighting the emotional one. It's hard to express how bad that kind of anxiety is for me. Came from an abusive household and have had nothing but bad relationships in my life, so it's always on high alert. It's completely detached from all logic and just feels what it feels, no matter how much I tell it to shut up. I have moodswings and a feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach that's so strong it causes physical pain. Even worse, my roommate's in the process of moving, so for the whole month I've just been alone to fight through all my worst intrusive thoughts in silence. It's like some kind of shitty coming-of-age ritual.
 

 But I'm fully aware none of this is my friend's fault or responsibility and in fact, think maintaining a stable FWB sitch without any other expectations could be perfect for that. Unlike in my disastrous relationships, I'm on meds and much more experienced with coping and communicating, so unlike I would've before, I'm not externally losing my shit. But it's still ruining my day, the waiting and uncertainty suck, and it feels like rejection even though literally nothing's changed. Have been smoking weed all day so I can calm down.
 

 Just in case, since this is Reddit and it's the most common advice, I don't want to hear that I should cut off contact with them. Maybe it's inevitable I'll get hurt later, but I really want to do better. Break the cycle, deal with my intrusive thoughts, respect their boundaries, and try not being a fucking doomer and letting things progress naturally for once.
 

 Give me some hope or encouragement, I guess. In the meantime, I'll probably just have another bowl rip and get all up in my feelings listening to Fishmans' Long Season for the umpteenth time.
 

 (Originally posted to [r/MMFB](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/) last night, but everything still applies, including the last sentence: can't get enough of that album. Today was much easier than yesterday, though. The anxiety's getting less intense.)"
"Large rant ahead…
 

 It all started in early summer of 2020. My teeth started hurting. They were sensitive and had an edge of pain when I would bite or chew on things. I figured I had gotten a cavity. However, the dentist couldn’t find evidence of one and we came to the conclusion that I was likely clenching or grinding.
 

 Fast forward a few months later… my vocabulary seemed to be suffering. I felt like I was stumbling over words. I felt more fatigued than I usually do. I went to my GP. She didn’t seem concerned. Blood work came back normal. Examination was normal. I then read about Covid fatigue and how many people being trapped at home were having the same difficulties I was. Maybe things were fine.
 

 Around the start of 2021, my heartburn got a lot worse and some new symptoms cropped up related to my digestive system. I started taking omeprazole to get things under control, but somehow things got even worse! I started regurgitating food when I would burp. It felt like my esophagus was swollen or inflamed, and I had a constant lump in my throat. I decided to stay on omeprazole for a bit to keep the acid under control. Then the diarrhea started. I get a bad cramp, and run to the bathroom. Most of the time, it happened not long after eating. After taking it easy for a few days, I resumed a normal diet and the diarrhea came back. I narrowed it down to dairy being the culprit. As time has progressed, the diarrhea stopped, but I am now fully lactose intolerant, if not straight allergic to dairy. If I have lactose, I am in pain and the gas is phenomenally bad. I miss cheese so much….
 

 In summer of 2021, my anxiety was heightened due to everything I’ve mentioned up above, my uncle dying of a heart attack, work stress, and marriage stress. I started having difficulty sleeping at night. I had a sleep study performed and they found I was struggling to get good deep sleep. My eyes got really sensitive and I started seeing static and floaters. Meanwhile, my fatigue seemed to hit new heights. I couldn’t work a full 8 hours per day anymore. Occasionally, I’d get pain in my limbs that felt bone deep. I had scheduled an appointment with a new GP for July and I ran everything by her. After a large set of blood work, the one thing that came back was my Vitamin D was low. I was so relieved because it seemed like Vitamin D could be the overall culprit!
 

 My GP started having me supplement my Vitamin D and things seemed to (again) get worse. The muscle pains continued, I started getting random muscle twitching all over my body, and numbness/tingling in my scalp, hands, and feet. It was around this stage that I really started fearing for there being something really wrong with me. As my GP instructed, I finished my 8 week Vitamin D supplementation, then I shared with my GP that things were still not going well. I didn’t feel as tired as I was before, but my muscles were complaining a lot. The pain comes and goes. I still get muscle twitching/spasming. I told her I was worried about something like MS. My sleep worsened. I have been prescribed numerous sleep aids to help me fall asleep at night. Sometimes I fall asleep. Sometimes I toss and turn. Sometimes I can sleep without any help.
 

 My GP got me a referral to neurology and a brain MRI with contrast. The MRI came back normal, the neurologist ordered an EMG which also came back normal. At least MS was off the table.
 

 Now this brings me to 2022. I’m miserable. I can’t sleep well still. My legs hurt by the end of every day. My muscles continue to spasm/twitch/jerk. I can’t seem to catch a break on any particular day. If it’s not the fatigue, it’s my digestive system. If it’s not my digestive system, the pain is worse in my limbs. If it’s not the pain, I’m fatigued as hell due to not sleeping well.
 

 I suppose writing all of this, one would wonder how I’m even surviving. I have always prided myself on putting one foot in front of the other. Eventually, things always get back to normal, but this has been a long year and a half of miserable symptoms. I want to feel normal again. I want to not worry that there is some danger lurking in my body somewhere (like cancer). I want to be able to sleep like I used to. I want to feel like I have my health on my side again.
 

 I will count my blessings that I have a wife and kids and I can still be available to them. I have a job with a boss that understands my health comes first and if I have to call out sick, it’s because I am managing a lot. I am doing my best to help myself, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is really wrong even though all signs point to all of this being the result of anxiety. It’s difficult to look in the mirror and say “This is your anxiety, not something your doctors can’t find!” And have it stick.
 

 I just want to feel normal again… or at least close to normal. If you made it this far, I hope you are doing better than I am. May you find the peace you are looking for while I try and find mine."

"It just feels extremely fucked up, I can't even explain it exactly.
 

 I mean, everyone may feel a bit weirded out when for example they meet a person that they haven't seen in years (let's say a classmate from middle school) because the physical appearance may change or stuff like that, even if the relationship is the same. The problem is: take that feeling, multiply it by 100 and apply it even to people that aren't changed neither physically nor mentally.
 

 Then it starts to feel like you are in a weird tranced, like if you are high on something but in a bad way. You know who they are and the relationship is the same but it's like if your mind and body know that, instead ""you"" are living those kind of fucked up feelings.
 

 Anyone relate somehow to this? How would you describe this weird feeling?"

"I'm 30. 
 

 I've always been terrified of driving and then I met my husband when i was 24, who was understanding about it at first. Now we want to start a family but he doesn't want to until I get my driver's license. I went for my test back in November and it was terrible. Every time I get behind a wheel I'm panicking, my heart races, I want to cry because I keep thinking that I going to do something wrong and get hurt or worse, hurt someone else. Even in the passenger seat I panic sometimes. We'll drive past somewhere where I've driven before and made a mistake and have to physically stop myself from hyperventilating. 
 

 My husband just says, ""just calm down"" and doesn't understand anymore that I just CAN'T. I want to.. but can't. I try to think positively and try to be more determined but my fear is greater and takes over so quickly. I just, don't want to drive.. but afraid that it will affect my marriage. 
 

 When I lived in Boston, I took the T and public transportation everywhere, but now we live in a state that doesn't really have public transportation and driving is kinda essential..

"*Disclaimer: This post contains poop-related subject matter.*
 

 I want to preface this by saying **of course** my HA accelerates when I have idle time on my own to overthink (ie. the weekend). So cruel. As it is Sunday, I can't even make an appointment to help alleviate some of this anxiety I'm experiencing. I am planning on calling my GP for a referral to a GI tomorrow, first thing. Also planning on directly calling the GI's office tomorrow morning to see if a referral is even needed and try to get in ASAP.
 

 **So here I am - staring down the barrel of yet another HA journey, scrambling for scraps of reassurance like pieces of driftwood as I drown in panic. I (30F) have experienced hemorrhoids and occasional rectal bleeding off and on since I can remember.**
 

 This has been going on before pregnancy and birth (I have a three year old). I often deal with constipation (chalked this up to dehydration) or the reverse - diarrhea (chalk this up to poor diet). Upset tummy and urge to go when I'm anxious, nervous, or excited (IBS?) I have visible hemorrhoids, so I've never been extremely alarmed or concerned by this - up until now. A few months back I visited my GP and she assured me that it was normal, as I had visible hemorrhoids, anxiety, but she can oftentimes be dismissive. She is also very aware I have HA, so I do think she tries her best to minimize most of my concerns.
 

 I've bleed off and on since this visit, and was markedly constipated a couple of weeks ago. I regret not tracking bleeding now. However, normally when there is blood, there is some pain and difficulty involved in the process. Yesterday - there was bright red blood on the TP and in the bowl and was not accompanied by any sort of pain or extra effort in the process. My heart sank, although this has happened plenty of other times. For some reason this time I felt a sinking feeling and fear taking hold while staring at this bloody TP.
 

 Flash forward to 24 hours later, a sleepless night, google and reddit threads flashing in front of my eyes - I am terrified I have CC. I'm really upset with myself for not advocating for myself and pushing for a GI referral or a colonoscopy referral. Now I'm wishing with everything in me that I had a colonoscopy first thing tomorrow - or right now for that matter.
 

 No family history of colon cancer, my mother does have colitis though (brought on by stress and is currently in remission), she has also had one polyp removed. My grandfather apparently had severe hemorrhoids, however, no ""c"" word. I turned 30 *this month* and I knew passing the threshold from 20's to 30's would wreak some sort of havoc on my HA, and here we are.
 

 For those of you who have experienced this specific sort of HA (a very unique and special type of hell) your experience would be very appreciated. Especially if you've had the symptomology I've experienced. I'll make sure to update for any of you out there going through this as well.
 

 Now to put my phone away and go outside for a walk!"
"I've (M27) dating for the past month a woman (F32) who has GAD , and I noticed she has a hard time reaching orgasm when we are together,, she doesn't want to touch her self in front of me, and she is reluctant to use toys. I feel somehow responsible, because I want her to have a good time too.
 

 Which way would be the best to adress this? Should I talk with her about it or would it make it worse (because she feels pressure?)? I want to support her but I don't know how. I need some advice"
"I've been hurt in the past, badly.... he cheated multiple times and would purposely flirt in front of me.... now I was young and stupid.... so I stayed... then he called and broke up with me on my birthday.....

 All in all, I let my guard down sooner than I typically would have.... and I've been ghosted after almost half a year.... it's frustrating because it brings me back to that point in the past... what is wrong with me? ....
 So maybe it's because it's a new year and anxiety doesn't help.... but holy smokes, am I really that bad of a person that I need to keep getting ghosted? Like everyone says I'm a great person, but then I start doubting it because of how I'm treated.... and now I'm in tears because, thanks anxiety, trying to understand what I'm doing wrong....

"First of all.. HAPPY NEW YEAR!
 

  My girlfriend and I are solo tonight as she has covid so we are distant and solo in our house.. I was sitting in the hallway talking with her in the next room and she got invited to a zoom meeting with her girlfriends and, per usual, instant anxiety! Like my entire physiology shifts and I get stuck in my head.. I leave the room and do my own thing of corse but the judgement of them on where I am in the house and what am I doing just drives me crazy! They asked about me and she came in my room and said to come and say hi.. im like ""I can't sit with you on the laptop since your positive?!"" God forbid I say hi with her in the other room! Lol. Such a mess..
 

 I'm 34 now and I honestly find it laughable. I know myself so well at this point but the fact that I can't handle something like this just sux.. the judgement.. THE JUDGEMENT! HAHA
 

 hope everyone is having a good new year! Mine will be great once this dam zoom call is over (never)! THE JUDEMENT!"
"Hi all!
 

 Just looking for some advice from people who've had experience going on meds for anxiety/depression.
 

 Currently I'm 30 but I've had anxiety in some form or other since I've been about 12 and my doctor recommended antidepressants from the time I was 16 onwards. 
 

 I've never taken meds for my anxiety or depression as I alway had the thought process that if I use medication I'm not learning to mentally deal with the problem myself.
 

 I've gone to several therapists over the years who diagnosed me with general anxiety disorder and recommended antidepressants. Due to stubbornness and a bit of fear I've still avoided taking meds and instead tried to learn everything I can about how to solve my anxiety and depression myself (reading a ton of books on this subject and regularly going to CBT and practicing mindfulness). All these different things have helped me to cope with my anxiety and depression so much over the years however I'm still not 100%. 
 

 I still feel anxious quite regularly nearly like there's a constant feeling of dread in the background and I've a tendency to completely go into a depression at the very least once a month when I can't bring myself to get out of bed and barely talk to anyone.
 

 I've a loving family, girlfriend, a great dog and a job in an industry I love so I don't really have any personal issues but yet have never been able to shake this anxiety/depression.
 

 Has anyone ever been in the same boat and found that medication has helped them? 
 

 I have all the usual fears of will it inherently change my personality? Will I be dependant on the meds for the rest of my life and therefore create more anxiety when I eventually get off them? When I get off them will I be able to handle situations without them?"
"Does anyone here feel like they just have no business driving? I'm (30F) slowly getting better at it but I still have to go for my final test (full g here in Ontario canada) and for that one I have to drive on a highway and apparently do all the parking again 🙃 part of me just wants to NOT do it and let my license expire eventually, but I've spent money on the lessons, and it's been SO handy with having 4 kids and going to Dr appointments. My biggest issue now I would say is just the fear of driving on major highways at high speeds (which I'll have to do for my g test) I would like to eventually get over that fear so I can drive to go see my family and not have to ask others to drive me. 
 Does anyone have any tips that have helped them specifically with driving on the highway? I've done it once, while I was with my mother inlaw (she has this calming comforting thing about her) and I was ok! But It's been a year since I've been on the 401 (I'm sure there are people who live around here and know of the 401 highway lol) it's all so overwhelming and I even get anxious as a passenger!"
"My genetics ruined life for the most part, but overprotective parenting didn't help either. I saw it ruin most ppl who had to live thru it.
 

 It has its perks, but it's guaranteed to do some heavy damage.
 

 Unsupervised parenting is more high risk high reward ig."
"In the past I was bullied a lot. A lot of people rejected me out of their group, made fun of me, criticized things I did. Things I wore weren't good, things I said were laughed at and people threatened me.
 

 Because of this, I view people as malicious. It feels like I have to be consistently living up to certain standards for fear of dire consequences. Whether it is social behaviour, holding certain viewpoints, sexual performances, being funny. If I feel I am not living up to group expectations the consequences are really bad. It feels like people are constantly after me because they used to actually BE constantly after me.
 

 I have been talking to a therapist about this and will continue to do so, but I would like some contact with people who know this feeling. Are there people here who understand how I feel?"
"\-Got a health scare over nothing, made me get on a dumb diet and lose weight, even tho im skinny as is.
 

 \-Developed severe guilt over evil things i did in the past.
 

 \-Attempted to end my life.
 

 \-Family fighting got worse, house split in 2 teams, with me caught in between.
 

 \-Fear, envy, self hate and rejection of everything in my life got to all time high.
 

 What about you?"
I am 33 year old male virgin who is attracted to a 20 something year old woman. She works at a local recreation centre that I go to use the sauna and attend yoga classes. I suffer from Adhd and social anxiety. I feel confident the night before that I go there but my best laid plans fall into ruin the moment that I talk to her. I think my brain is freezing. I once asked out a girl when I was 12. She publicly rejected me and humiliated me. I am probably not the best looking guy ever but I do workout and try to stay in shape. I look way younger than my biological age. I am at a loss at what I'm suppose to do. I just thought I would come here and vent my frustration.
"I (31F) have a type of OCD/anxiety called retroactive relationship anxiety. Basically I get very insecure and “jealous” (bad word to describe it really) of my boyfriend’s (30M) ex girlfriends. It’s so dumb because I literally feel secure and loved my my bf. But I can’t control my OCD thoughts where I compare myself to people in his past and tell myself that I’m not funny enough, or pretty enough, or sexual enough. And I convince myself that if the situation presented itself, my bf would choose his ex’s over me any day. He didn’t do anything to cause this; it started with a toxic relationship years ago. I’ve talked about it in therapy but it’s not super common so I don’t think it was addressed well. I just wish I could be more confident and love myself. It’s like I’m trying to push my bf away to fulfill my anxiety in a way that I can control. Even though it’ll make me unhappy, at least I was right! Fuck anxiety."
"Does your ethnicity or culture have elements of anxiety compared to other cultures?
 

 I've always noticed being submissive is more common in my culture, which has made me despise myself even more.
 

 I've also started hating other cultures where ppl are loud and difficult."
"Does anxiety cause accelerated aging too?
 

 Around May of 2020, I discovered that I may have some form of situational anxiety - when entrusted with a responsibility, I chicken out. HARD. So much so that I've quit jobs rather than take up more responsibility.
 

 I was 23 back then, and save my overgrown beard, most people could tell I was 22-24 years old.
 

 Fast forward January 2022, and these two years have been the worst two years of my life. Not because of Covid - but because of a quarter-life crisis I've been having ever since, and the anxiety means I just while my days away without doing anything meaningful.
 

 As someone who will turn 25 shortly, I find that I look a lot like I'm 30. I'm noticeably overweight, but most people tend to think I'm 30. Male-pattern baldness has set in, my hair are whitening, I'm having slight ankle, knee and shoulder aches, and my general persona resembles someone who is, indeed, 30.
 

 So I've aged 7 years in two, and I have nothing to show for it. I hate this."
"Again, got really irritated and aggravated the other day until my bavk and arm started hurting which made me paranoid which has made me anxious. This happened on Tuesday. I finally got a massage on Wednesday because I know my muscles get really tight from my anxiety and stress. But it's like my back is still aching and it gives me such paranoid that something might be wrong with me ughhhh
 

 Just venting a little 😔😣"
"I am 31M and new to the dating world (broke up ~5 months ago with a ~6 year gf). I live in a very large city (e.g., NYC, LA, SF, etc.) and have recently started using the apps (Bumble and Hinge). 
 

 I am a decent looking dude who is in shape (5’8”, 160lbs), have an MBA / great job ($250K+ / year), am fun / have a good social life, and don’t have any red flags / baggage. 
 

 Anyhow, I’m not trying to brag. 
 

 My point is that even with a seemingly good dating profile (and a fairly good success rate on the dating apps), I constantly feel anxiety around being single forever. I know it’s irrational but I can’t help it…. I’ll go on a date with a girl I end up liking and I get very anxious waiting for her to reply. 
 

 It seems so easy / obvious to me to be more confident / have self esteem, but I just don’t. I don’t know why and I’d love to fix this.
 

 Any tips?"
"Hi, I'm new here and I already feel way less alone. I'll try to keep this concise but ultimately I'd like reassurance that my current physical symptoms could truly just be anxiety.
 

 Last week while driving I experienced numbness in my left arm. This isn't uncommon but, like every time, I immediately panicked about having a heart attack (32F, overweight but active) and got worked up. This led to me feeling dizzy and having digestion discomfort. I made it home after a long drive but the dizziness and disomfort remained. I live alone so the idea of having an emergency with no one here makes my anxiety worse. The symptoms of heart attack are so similar to anxiety that I convinced myself to go to urgent care. They tested for covid, my blood, urine, EKG, and a chest x-ray. They told me everything looked fine (later I looked and my white blood cells are up and I have blood in my urine) and that it was likely anxiety. A similar thing happened this past summer when I came down with bronchitis.
 

 Well it's a week later and the symptoms remain. The most concerning is the continued dizziness and intense unease. I have the heaviness in my chest, back pain, numbness of hands and feet, chills, burning sensation of my legs, the feeling of shortness of breath but I'm actually breathing fine, nausea, and I can feel my heart pounding but my heart rate in normal. I'm use to these symptoms during a typical ""anxiety attack"" but the feeling does. not. go. away. It's like I'm stuck in an anxiety attack. I'm taking my ""as needed"" clonazepam. I'm in the process of getting a primary care doctor and have an appointment in a month.
 

 I go back and forth between telling myself it is just in my head and my body just needs time to come down from the health scare or that something serious really is going on and I could pass out any moment. I'm a teacher on winter break so my stress levels should be at an ultimate low. My therapist thinks that since my job is so stressful that its just catching up with me.
 

 I guess I'm asking if anyone else has experienced this."
"I am in my late 20s and I am extremely shy and have a lot of social anxiety. I am scared to tell my coworkers that my brother lives in the US for fear they will google him. He lives in the same city as my companys headquarters in the US. He did a phd in his field and he would be easily searchable. Scared they will judge me and say he is rich for example because of where he works. He has a very top position in his field. I am also scared of them finding it weird of why i have not shared this with them before. 
 

 I am also nervous of sharing with people the high school i went to as it is a private school. I am scared they will judge me as wealthy for havkng gone there. I feel really guilty of being more well off than my peers 
 

 Does anyone have any help? How can i stop worrying so much what people think of me? I am seeing a therapist and i started taking medication.
 

 Any advice?"

"I'm a 32M with generalized anxiety disorder. I'd like to help my parents better understand my anxiety. They know what it is at a surface level but something that goes deeper into the thought processes, the physical symptoms, and how to help/support loved ones would be good. Are there any books/websites like this? Thanks"
"The social anxiety is getting worse. I actually enjoy isolating and its not because I'm depressed. I have gotten to the point where i literally am home %98 of the time. 
 

 I work at home, order groceries for delivery(and anything else i need), i have a home gym(that I've built up buying equipment on buy/sell/trade sites), and every now and then I'll go on a lil drive somewhere. But for the most part I just like being at home. 
 

 Some people may call that lazy..but I'm not lazy lol i still get ready each day and get dressed, do my makeup, shower if i need to, etc. And like i said, I work at home. A regular hourly wage job, its just remote.
 

 I have 1 friend who i rarely see in person anymore and live with my bf, who also works at home.
 

 

 I went to Fry's yesterday and i swear as soon as i walk thro the sliding glass doors i get a cold sweat and my face gets hot..my heart races..my blood pressure rises..i literally forgot everything i went into the store for..so i rush thro and grab a few things. 
 And soon as its all over i realize and remember why I don't do that 🤦🏼 then as I sit in the car I realize I forgot half the shit I ran in there for. 
 

 Idk why my social anxiety has gotten so bad as I've gotten older. I am 34 and can't even have normal human interaction anymore. I wish i knew why.

"Idk what it is about me, but I’ve been dumped by a lot of friends during my lifetime.
 

 I’ve had pretty okay to good luck in the romance department. I feel like I have men down pretty good when it comes to love.
 

 But friends I struggle with. My therapists and family have given me reasons why these friends leave. Some say it’s jealousy, I’m too sensitive, I March to the best of my own drum and thus don’t follow along easily, we grow apart, random situations, they were never my friends and using my empathy and compassion, etc. Whatever the reason, the result is always the same: I have no female friends.
 

 Now I’m afraid to make any. I’m afraid that being myself, they secretly make fun of me. Or use it as ammo to get what they want later. Or are only nice to me so that I’ll care for them.
 

 It’s like I desperately long for deep friendship and reject it at the same time. I’ve been dumped by 10 best friends, let alone the random smaller friendships. What friends I do have now, I worry I’ll lose them. 
 

 How do you move past this?"
"I have finally decided to make an appointment with my PCP because my anxiety is running my life more than it ever has before, and I have decided I cannot live this way anymore. But I am terrified of the actual doctor's appointment where I will ask for help, and I was hoping someone of you could tell me your stories just so I know what to expect. 
 

 A little background on me: I grew up in the kind of environment where my family didn't ""believe in"" mental health. I don't think anything in particular triggered my anxiety, but I've known I've had it my whole life. I vividly remember my first panic attack at 3 or 4 years old. I asked my parents for help one time at around 12 years old. They ignored and dismissed me, and I was too afraid to ask again. I set a goal for myself in college to start over and be honest and open about how I was feeling. By sophomore year, I felt comfortable enough that when mental health came up organically when talking with my best friend, I mentioned how I have been dealing with anxiety all my life. He didn't believe me. It was devastating. He straight up was surprised and was just like, ""what? there's no way you have anxiety."" Except because I've been dismissed my whole life I've gotten really, really, really good at hiding it. And coping with it, actually. I realized when researching it online that the coping mechanisms I developed were actually things recommended by doctors to do. But those coping mechanisms aren't working anymore and the panic attacks are more frequent and last way longer, and I know I need to seek help. But I'm afraid because:
 

 * I'm 30 and just bringing it up now. What if they don't believe it's as bad as it is considering I've lived this long without help?
 * I feel like at every physical I've never said anything, so they will think I've been lying all this time.
 * I might get put on some intense regime or therapy that I just can't afford. (I am hoping to get medication that I can take if my other coping mechanisms fail.)
 * I don't know if I should tell them I have taken lorazepam before. I was prescribed two doses because I had a panic attack about getting a certain medical procedure done, and I realized that it helped with more than just the procedure-related anxiety. My friend also once gave me one of her lorazepam pills (I know you shouldn't do this, but I was desperate at the time and it was the same kind and dose as what I had been prescribed earlier) when I had a particularly bad panic attack and it helped. I don't want anyone to think I am drug seeking.
 

 If you have made it this far, thanks for reading. If I can just get an idea about how some of your first appointments went, I really believe I can summon the courage to say something this time."

"My husband has always been fearful of his health failing. He has a minor heart issue that prevents him from sports involving sprinting, but otherwise is completely healthy (34M). 5 months ago he had something like a TIA/mini stroke or atypical migraine. Since then he's been experiencing physical symptoms that his many doctors can't attribute to any particular illness. Numbness of body parts, extreme muscle fatigue but no weakness, dizziness and nausea, etc. I am not a particularly empathetic person, but I tell him daily I am here to help him deal and/overcome his physical illness and/or health anxiety. He acknowledges that his symptoms may be stress/anxiety induced, but he doesn't have then in check yet. I got him to start seeing a therapist, per his request but I had to schedule bc he's having difficulty with day to day tasks (he asked me to schedule), but today is only his second meeting so I don't expect much yet. He has regular appts with neurologists and his primary, as well as calling our friend who is a MD when he is panicking. It's gotten to the point where he checks his BP, heart rate, and O2 levels many times a day. All normal.
 

 I am asking for advice bc I don't have an outlet for the stress his anxiety has brought me. I am a stay at home mom, but he works from home as well. He just quit his cooperate job and is only going to work our family business for now on bc he can't function for half the day (needs to lie down) and we are in a great financial position thank God. I leave the house to play soccer once a week, but otherwise he asks that I don't leave him alone with the kids bc he's afraid he might not be able to care for them if he has an medical episode. He is a great father and husband, takes just as much responsibility as I do for the children and he watches them while I'm at home he just needs me in earshot bc he's afraid he'll collapse or something (hasn't happened). Early on I let him call an ambulance and brought him to the walk in many, many, times. But per medical recommendations and his agreement he is not to do it that unless he is dying. It's unnecessary and the pandemic means he won't get seen by a Dr unless he's medically unstable anyways. He left the ER after being driven by an ambulance 7 hours later without being seen, he thought it was a heart attack...but alas it wasn't. 
 

 What do I do? How do I help him? How do I get a mental break myself? One child is in preschool the other toddler stays home with me. It's winter, we can't play outside (10 degrees out today), can't play inside elsewhere (COVID), and my husband is giving off depressing vibes that are slowly eating away at my spirit. I don't want to be selfish (straight up call me out if I am), I want to be supportive, but my mental burden is too high with taking care of the house, meals, the children, and him to all day. 
 

 I love him to pieces."
"Hi all, a month or two ago I upped my dosage of Lexapro from 10mg to 20mg and boy did I feel like a new person.. I transitioned to night shift for my job, was able to go to the gym again, and much more.. until a week ago my cousin (33F) passed away from COVID complications.. not even a day later I tested positive with symptoms. During the time I was sick I was fine and my anxiety wasn’t super high until I was cleared to go back to work( I work in healthcare) earlier than I was probably ready for. I had a horrible panic attack mid shift sending me to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack due to chest pains and nausea. Ever since the panic attack I haven’t been the same. No changes with my Lexapro, but I am constantly battling my anxiety all over again.. I don’t know what to do.. I’m starting to get the helpless feeling again."
"Guys I need tips and tricks to help me get over my heart anxiety.. I’ve been to the ER multiple times, called an ambulance, etc thinking I was having a heart attack or something else. I’m 24F, pretty active and healthy. Just recently after COVID I developed anxiety about my heart again. I’m medicated and it was doing wonders until I had a horrible panic attack the other day."
"I feel more at ease with people (or a group of people) that I am meeting for the first time in my life, or second or third time. After I have spent time with those people for, like, some weeks or months, I have a tendency to create some ideas in my mind about those people finding me socially inadequate or something, and then I can't anymore feel at ease with those people and I become kind of awkward when I'm around them, which can even make me want to avoid them altogether. I simply lose confidence. When I was with them for the first time, I felt relatively okay about my social skills and felt I acted normal on a minimal level. Afterwards, I become awkward with them. Does it happen with anyone else here?"
"I’m at work right now having an anxiety attack about my heart.. I know it’s just anxiety, but my resting heart rate is 60-75 bpm, but as soon as I start walking or moving faster than normal it goes to 113-114.. is this normal. I’m not in horrible shape, I’m freaking out."
"I'm 30 and full of envy and rage at ppl who party, fight, and live carefree. I still want to live my childhood and early 20s.
 

 Instead I've lived my 20s in anxiety, hypocondria, bullying and a broken home."
"Hi everyone, new poster here. I've had anxiety my whole life (formerly diagnosed with GAD when I was 21, I'm 30 now) and I haven't been able to work for the past couple of years because of it. My husband and I were trying for a baby for a year before I fell pregnant, we found out super early at 3 weeks last December. Ever since then, my anxiety has been debilitating. I'm on medication for it that seemed to be working okay before I got pregnant, and my GP and OB decided I should increase the dosage. That was 4 weeks ago and I'm not any better. I just don't want to be awake. I sleep at least 16 hours a day and cry the other 8. I see a psychologist who's been on holidays for 6 weeks and thankfully comes back this week, but I honestly don't think she'll be able to help.
 

 All I can think is that I'll always feel this way. I already love our baby but I've also had really horrible morning sickness. That combined with the anxiety makes me have moments where I don't even want to be pregnant anymore, despite how wanted this baby is and the fertility treatment we went through to get here. I had a miscarriage last June that might be triggering some of this, but mostly I just keep thinking that I'll never feel better and always feel this doom and dread looming over me.
 

 Has anyone had the same experience?"
[removed]
"Apologies in advance as this will be a long post but I would like to share some detailed context on how I've gotten to this point and seek advice from those who have been through this. 
 

 **Overall context**
 

 * I've always been somewhat of an anxious person but it was mild/manageable and I had very little awareness about mental health issues. FYI - I come from a culture in which mental health is ignored and people who suffer from it are accused of being weak.
 * Everything changed when I had my first full blown panic attack when I was 25. I didn't know that's what it was at the time and thought I was having a heart attack but thankfully I was in a social setting with a friend who had long dealt with anxiety who was able to talk me through it and calm me down.
 * From that day forward, I was now ""aware"" of my anxiety but it was still manageable. I would get shortness of breath when stressed and feel anxious but I was always able to alleviate with simple breathing exercises or stepping away from whatever situation I was in.
 * In the following years, it never escalated to the level of a panic attack again.
 * Some additional important context: 
  * I've worked in a very high stress job with long hours (management consulting) for the past five years and have grown to absolutely hate it 
  * My ""exit"" from this job that I hate is to go do my MBA and change industries upon graduation, but that has led to an immense amount of stress as the MBA application process is extremely daunting / time consuming. It essentially took over my life for the last six months (on top of my difficult work set-up)
 

 **Present Day**
 

 * Fast forward to present day (I'm now 31) - I was walking through the mall on a day off last week without a worry in my mind. Out of nowhere with zero warning, a massive panic attack hits. Once again, I thought it was a heart attack or something was wrong physically (recently recovered from Covid and other illnesses) - especially considering it had been so long since my last one.
 * I put headphones in with calming music and made my way to the closest bathroom I could find to try a breathing exercise which didn't really help. I managed to escape the mall and head home but was completely unable to relax and felt a generalized anxiety at all times.
 * Once again, I reached out to a friend who I knew had dealt with this for a long time and she helped me through it by giving me some techniques (cold water, stimulating vagal nerve, going for a walk, etc.)
 * I immediately made an appt. with a psychiatrist and was prescribed xanax to help alleviate my situation in the short-term and have simultaneously kicked off psychotherapy sessions (first session was a couple of days ago)
 

 **The Issue**
 

 * I feel like this has now taken over my life. I'm hyper aware of my anxiety at all times and I'm only staying afloat due to the meds. The best way I can put it: it feels like there was a box I had sealed for very long which now has a crack in it and I can't stop it from overflowing
 * I started the xanax with a tiny dose (0.25mg) in the evening which was half the psychiatrists recommendation (as I'm very reluctant to use medication) but have had to up that to two doses per day (before bed and mid-day) as I noticed anxiety rushing back once the medication wore off.
 * This past weekend, I was out at a dinner with friends and felt an attack coming and could do nothing to hold it off - I ended up having to abruptly leave the dinner with zero warning and was barely able to get home
 * I'm now in constant fear of the next attack and the medication wearing off. 
 * I know this process will takes months of therapy, reading, meditation, and work on myself to uncover the root causes and learn to separate myself from the panicked thoughts but I am so unsure of how to get there without sacrificing my social life and constantly living in fear of the next attack
 

 I've just come across this community and I'm hoping there's people out there who have been through a similar situation and can help me figure out how to get through this roughest stretch. 
 

 Thank you in advance."
"Mine are together more than 30 yrs now. Wish everyday they divorce. Just tired of their fights.
 

 There's gonna be a massive fight today or tomorrow, just fucking hoping it doesn't get violent.
 

 Anxiety and shit parents is a garbage combo. I'd celebrate their death if i wasn't dependent on em."
"I (30m) serve tables. I know, not the best job for someone with SA but it's the highest paying ""unskilled labor"" I could get. I have episodes where I feel incredibly uncomfortable in my own skin and try and act as normal as possible. I dropped off a check at a table where 2 people were sitting. A couple who was slightly older than me, I assume.
 

 Anyway as I walk away I hear the woman mutter to the man ""God, he's so fucking weird."" Granted, I'm sure I was acting off but I'm never rude. It's hard for me to be intentionally rude to someone and I try very hard to be nice. 
 

 I've dealt with a rejection like this before and it ruined my whole day. It didn't quite do that this time but it still hurt and further discomforted me. I should probably get a job that's more SA friendly but this is my life for now. It's frustrating that my brain values the fleeting thoughts of strangers more than own."
"I'd be far less of an anxious pussy if i could hold my own in a fight.
 

 No one's gonna care how assertive and loud you are if you're tiny and can't back your attitude with force."
"Long story short, 31F that was diagnosed with GAD in college. I was going through a lot, including death of a parent and was put on Xanax for panic attacks as needed. Once I got a handle on things, I didn’t take it anymore. Fast forward to 29, my anxiety was peaking again. I even had to get sent to a cardiologist to rule out heart issues…stress test was passed and they said nope, just your anxiety! My doctor put me on buspar and it really didn’t work for me. I needed something that was as needed, and not daily. I didn’t like it and stopped taking it. Now, at 31, I went to a new doctor and she asked if I’ve been taking anything for my anxiety. I explained the buspar thing and that I gave up because it wasn’t for me. She told me she wanted me to try hydroxyzine first and would move me back to Xanax if it didn’t work. Well a few days ago, I tried the hydroxyzine and hated it! It didn’t help my heart rate or my racing thoughts, and just made me feel very sleepy and weird. I was still very drowsy the next day as well. I have a job that requires me to be very sharp at all times and I really cannot afford to be “out of it”. 
 

 Basically, after trying this, I wrote my doctor and asked if we can go back to Xanax. Half of me didn’t want to ask because I don’t know if I seem like a drug user since I’m asking. There’s so much taboo surrounding anxiety meds because potential for abuse/addiction. 
 

 It could be just my anxiety now that’s causing me to feel that way. So what do you think? Is it a red flag? I’m on the verge of a panic attack now and that medicine isn’t compatible at all. Thanks for reading. Sorry this is so long.
 

 ETA: my doctor did put it in for me and we are going to discuss other possible options at our next meeting. So if anyone has any suggestions for something a little less strong that still works for you, let me know! I would ideally like to be on the weakest thing possible that still “works”.

He lives in the same city as my companys headquarters in the US. He did a phd in his field and he would be easily searchable. Scared they will judge me and say he is rich for example because of where he works. He has a very top position in his field. I am also scared of them finding it weird of why i have not shared this with them before. 
 

 I am also nervous of sharing with people the high school i went to as it is a private school. I am scared they will judge me as wealthy for havkng gone there. I feel really guilty of being more well off than my peers 
 

 Does anyone have any help? How can i stop worrying so much what people think of me? I am seeing a therapist and i started taking medication.
 

 Any advice?"
"Just never act on your health anxiety. Don't go on any crazy diets or habits or exercises, if anything you might even end up ruining what was otherwise a healthy body.

"Hi Reddit 
 

 It started several years ago .I am 30 years old now ..I was very stressed and depressed .I accidentally read an article about how many people die choking on food each year and after that I developed that phobia 
 

 It's ok when I am at home or around people who know me well but it gets terrible when I have to eat out , I basically just take 2 bites or eat very soft food ( like ice cream ,yogurt and etc )
 

 Strange thing is that I developed that phobia when I was on high floor in the apartment and and that is why it gets way worse when I am on high floor ..I basically find it impossible to eat there 
 

 No wonder it makes my life very complicated ,can you please tell me how to convince my brain that eating ( and especially on high floor) is not dangerous? or share your experiences with me 
 

 P.s I tried therapy fro short time but it did not help ,I live in developing country so it is almost impossible to find a qualified therapist in my area 
 

 I have general anxiety and social anxiety since 18 .."

"I'll preface this with, I don't know when things need a TW. Sincerest apologies if I did that wrong. 
 On mobile. So sorry for format and such.
 I dont know where else to go with this question(concern?). Since HS I stayed between 140 and 160 without really trying, only hitting 199 when I was full term in '14, and almost immediately dropped back to the 150s. At some point I started gaining and before I knew it I was 200lbs in 2019. Well, a lot of drama ensued that fall/winter, resulting in a huge decline in my mental health and within a month I'd lost 30lbs. I was on autopilot and eating was not a priority. Well, when I realized what I was doing, I started forcing myself to eat more regularly, but my appetite is nonexistent. In about 6 months I was down to 140lbs, and not gonna lie, it felt nice to be back to my lowest adult weight, but I stayed anxious about not eating enough. Well, I decided to turn to the (terrifying) world of reddit for some advice, since today the scale said 120lbs. I still have no appetite, im constantly nauseous, ive seen doctors and specialists(GI docs checked me WELL), there was nothing (physically) wrong with me. 
 I guess I just kind of feel like I'm wasting away, I basically just snack on things here and there, trying to at least get a bite of various things throughout the week. I just dont know how to get my anxiety to chill so I can want to eat again? I haven't had a full meal in ages. 
 Sorry this is super rambly, like I said, I'm on mobile and I may even delete this, I've been typing it for an hour worrying this isn't going to make any sense...."

"I (30f) been using meds for over 9years now ( and had panick attacks for 15y).
 

 Now my psychiatrist started reducing my meds to wear off of them slowly with the help of CBT.
 

 This seem all beautifull, to be able one day to depend fully on my own body capacities and not on medication and be able tofeel things not just navigating life in a num body.But I have a big issue I was hidding all these last 15 years, is when I am in public sittings randomly my body has a panick attack but with intense body twitching like my head, hands, eye rolling etc.My body chose to do so in random ways or specific ways. Like when talking about something sexual , my body start panicking and twitching without my own control, or whe people talk about someone else it does the same , or sometimes he does it randomly. So I know some situations where he will surely do it that's why I was avoiding them before which wasnt helpfull toheal me from panick attacks.
 

 Also , I get panick atatcks around people who are judge mental , the ones I know that they analyse anything and everything about everyone else. so I automaticly I panick and start twitching aroud them.
 

 My problem is, now I need to let my body twitch and not stop him from doing it whenever or wherever the panick starts so I can face my fears and heal. The problem is that I live in a judgemental sociaty, so it may happen the twitching to coincide with a word or a subject and automaticly my body will react just because I feel shy or weird about it or just the fact I am thinking about oh no i should not panick.. I feel like I will die if my symptoms show upinfront of my familly or in public. I still want to hide my symptoms but in the same time I want to heal. I am really afraid about what they will think of me, eventhoughh I cnt control what my body does and it is the only way I would heal.
 

 until now I am hiding in my room, but I should face this as soon as possible, since also my career suffered due to my illness.
 

 Any advice on how to deal with the panick and undesired body movements ? How can I do the first step and let it show up and stop resisiting hidding it ? how to accept the everyday embaricing feelings of people seeing me like this in weird conversations triggers ? any food any bookk anything that could help me get out of this prison of 15 years ?
 

 I just want to add that medicine made my sympthoms disapear ( only shows in extreeeeemstressfull situations) so would it possible that I will not have them after removing meds slowly + CBT ? Did anyone recover totaly from panick atatcks+ social anxiety+ body twitching ??
 

 Sorry if I was rambling I am very anxious and I hope I was able to explain it well."
"Just feel like I need to write this down. Maybe someone will find it helpful. 
 

 I consider myself an anxiety veteran. I was first diagnosed with both GAD and panic disorder 12 years ago. Since then I’ve had spells where my anxiety was very manageable, and periods where it really wasn’t (on and off medication/in therapy ever since my diagnosis). The last time it wasn’t manageable was in 2018, and even though it’s been under control, I have stayed in therapy. 
 

 My triggers are always physiological symptoms. I have intense health anxiety and deep fears of something very bad (medically speaking) happening to me. Obviously the pandemic hasn’t helped, but I’ve still been doing pretty okay, or so I thought. 
 

 I was at home tonight, in my pajamas, cooking dinner after a relaxing and lazy Sunday. Home is my safe space, so I was thrown when I started feeling anxiety. What triggered it was a moment of feeling lightheaded, which is a big trigger for me - I have an intense fear of passing out/fainting. In hindsight, I think my blood sugar was crashing; I hadn’t had lunch, and my breakfast was all carbs and sugar followed by a bunch of coffee 🙄
 

 Anyway, it escalated very quickly. All of my usual strategies went out the window and before I knew it, I was crying and hyperventilating. I took a Xanax and went to lay down on the bed, but couldn’t shake the intense fear that something was terribly wrong with me. My fiancé was by my side the entire time, but I kept asking him if we should go to the hospital. I have never gone to the hospital from a panic attack, but the physiological symptoms were so intense this time. The worst part is they didn’t go away for a long time (probably because of said low blood sugar). I was shaking uncontrollably for a while, even after the Xanax kicked in.
 

 I’m finally feeling better and managed to eat dinner (although no idea how I’m gonna be able to go to work tomorrow…) This was my first major panic in at least a year, and probably one of the worst I've ever had. I felt a sense of betrayal that it happened at home, and for a moment I felt like a failure that it happened at all.
 

 It's just a reminder that this is really a chronic illness. The best I can do is manage it with all of the tools I have - but even then, panic attacks will still happen from time to time. And yes, they'll be pretty fucking scary. No matter how many times you go through it, there's always a new thing popping up - a symptom or trigger or fear that you've never had before, that just explodes. I think this also made me realize that panic attacks rarely come from absolutely nowhere. I've been really stressed with work, and the general state of the world/pandemic, and other stuff in my life...I'm sure all of that was boiling under the surface and, even though maybe not directly related to the panic attack itself, were contributing factors.
 

 Just remember that it's okay to experience anxiety or a panic attack. Even if you've been dealing with it for a very long time - it can still happen, and that's okay. It doesn't mean that you're dying, and it doesn't mean that you're weak or a failure."
"This might be a long post, I haven't decided what my goal is here yet except for catharsis. I might tire out before putting all my thoughts down, but I have a lot to get off my chest. 
 

 I've struggled with anxiety for long before I even realized it was an issue. Sure, I was often an anxious person, and this was obvious, but I was so distracted by my bouts of depression which started in middle school, as well as general emotional volatility that prevented me from reflecting on this additional elephant in the room. I'm 30 and I've only really had 2 or 3 panic attacks, which I figured would be the clearest warning signs of an underlying anxiety disorder.
 

 I should have been clued in by how stressed I would get after smoking weed. All my friends would feel giggly and relaxed, but my mind would race a million miles an hour. I'd be convinced I could predict the future because I would always know when an argument between friends or family was going to start based on subtle shifts in conversation or the patterns in how people tend to react to certain kinds of statements.
 

 I always figured part of this was just an extension of how weed makes some people paranoid. But it was clear I had a problem. Even while sober, I'd often get nervous when I saw unfamiliar cars park outside my house. This got 10x worse after an encounter with a narcissistic sociopath bully who sent some passive aggressive ""non-threats"" my way. Every time he'd make a fake Instagram or Twitter account and try to follow me, I'd go down a rabbit hole of paranoia and intense anxiety wondering what his ultimate intentions were.
 

 Lately it's been finances and family drama raising my cortisol levels. The ever-present struggle to make more money and just get my finances in order after many setbacks and a lot of work stress, coupled with living in a family home where my brother's name is on the mortgage since he was in the best position when my dad passed away. He's married and lives in his own home, but he's constantly worried about appearances and pressuring us to do expensive house renovations on our old home. 
 

 To be clear, he doesn't pay any of our house bills and we are working towards doing renovations (and doing many small repairs as needed), but we don't have a ton of expendable income, and after medical issues and just struggling with being underpaid for many years (mostly my own fault for not learning how to negotiate sooner), I'm just now building up my savings ($5k liquid at age 30), purchasing my first mutual fund, trying to maximize my 401k, etc. 
 

 I respect my brother but he and my mom who I live with have horrible tempers and I'm so conflict averse about family shit after dealing with years of terrible family fights. I know the fact that he's pushy about the renovations and she's worried about not overspending to rush to repair everything while I and my other brother work on getting more financially settled is bound to lead to a bad argument. Even thinking about this makes me sick to my stomach. I've learned to speak up for myself over the years but I hate unnecessary arguments and wish my brother would just back off. It's hard because his name is on the house and i would hate to use up all my savings just to refinance and put the house under my own name so he can get off our backs. It seems like such an unnecessary move just to please his excessive demands.
 

 Idk what the point of writing all this is. I'm currently dealing with an LCL tear that will keep me from BJJ, one of the few activities that give me some relief. Video games don't bring me joy with all my anxiety rising up even while beating a temple in Zelda. I'm likely getting a good raise at work in 2 months during our yearly review, but my work has been unbearable for many other reasons. I don't need life to be easy, but I'm feeling like I'm drowning and there's no reprieve. If anyone read this far, thank you for your time. I'm just so fucking tired of this feeling."
"Outside of ha. I'm generally a mess and a massive loser, ha is only part of it.
 

 I doubt this thing exists without other problems."
"It takes me a while to find someone I genuinely like and would like to spend more time with. When it does happen, I get so so anxious that it's going to end- especially in the early stages. I'm not so good at hiding it. For example, I've currently been seeing a new date for a couple of weeks, had a few dates, things were going well and I was very chilled to begin with. But the more I realise I like her, the more intense I become because of my anxiety. I convince myself she doesn't feel the same, I convince myself she's talking to other guys and I feel as though she's avoiding the question of when she would like to see me again. I check to see when she was last on WhatsApp, and most of the time she is online, until quite late at night so I figured we do/did that so she must be doing it with someone else now it's not me.
 

 We're not seeing each other for another week and a half, although her next day off is in 5 days. She's said she's busy then so can't see me, and I just create scenarios that she must be going on a date with someone else.
 

 It's difficult, this sort of things happen to me all the time, and I find myself sounding desperate when asking when they'd like to meet up again. I find myself pacing, not eating, not sleeping or sleeping too much, no motivation and have called in sick to work previously.
 

 I'm so insecure, partly because of previous experiences and partly due to my lack of confidence. I'm 34 now and I'm struggling to get past this"
"Tl;dr: has anyone had a breakthrough of severe anxiety for no real reason? Has anyone found an actual physical reason behind their anxious feelings in their stomach/chest?
 

 This time last year I went through alot - divorce, new job, starting my whole life over again. I got through it on my own but did reach out to a psychiatrist to try anxiety meds (zoloft) for help sleeping. Of course, my anxiety was pretty high but, again, I went through most of the ugly parts of that with no help from medicine. I tapered off the zoloft a few months ago.
 

 Now- almost a month ago I had a weird episode while driving where my arm went numb and it spiralled into me thinking I was having a heart attack/stroke (this isn't the first time I've had health anxiety). After a visit to the ER and follow up with my doctor who did numerous tests - my doctor said it is anxiety and put me back on zoloft with a pretty quick increase to my previous dosage of 50mg. I had on and off anxiety for the past month and started my medication about two weeks ago. This past week, I have had the worst anxiety of my life. It's not coming in waves, it's just a constant pit in my stomach and chest pressure. I cant eat. And I've missed work a few times. This isn't at all the type of anxiety I'm used to. I'm having a lot of side effects this time around from the meds and I know it can make your anxiety worse at first but I don't understand where this came from and why its so bad.
 

 My therapist has given me the whole ""meditation, mindfulness, breathing techniques"" etc. but this seems way past those coping practices. And she has said that she doesn't really understand why I'm having such bad anxiety since there isn't anything in my life right now that would trigger it...like if I managed to get through the hell of last year, why am I struggling now? Has anyone else had unexplained breakthroughs of severe anxiety? 
 

 My sister is also a therapist and pushes that I get everything medically checked out (I dont know what else to check for) because she thinks its strange too but my doctor is confident that its anxiety and I just need to give me meds time...any advice or similar stories?"
"For whatever reason, knowing that a nurse is checking my blood pressure makes my anxiety spike through the roof and always leads to an insane reading (the systolic has gone as high as 191). The nurse always looks at me super concerned and asks if I have hypertension. Reality is: I'm 31 years old, in great shape, eat healthy, workout 5x a week but I simply have to explain that I simply can't control how anxious I get in this scenario.
 

 Has anyone else had this problem and figured out how to alleviate it?"

"Hey ex-smokers, how much did quitting actually help your anxiety? I've been wanting to quit for a long time (I'm 31F been smoking since I was 17), but.. you know.. anxiety.. and addiction. 🤣
 

 In addition, did your anxiety sky rocket during withdrawal? If so, how long did it take for you to level back out? I think I'm getting close to taking the plunge, but I want to be prepared."
"I have anxiety. I think my anxiety is due to the fact that I don’t believe my world/reality is safe. The world is full of unpleasant and harmful things and that means I am always on the lookout for these things.
 

 Back in 2014, I got a stomach bug from my son. I was miserably sick for 48 hours. It sucked. I survived. Then a month or so later, I recalled the memory and feared it happening again. My own home no longer felt safe because you can’t see what makes you sick. That trauma lasted for years.
 

 Now, my trauma has shifted. Whether it be stress, this pandemic, my marriage, or something else, my body has become fatigued, twitchy, anxious, and sometimes painful. Doctors cannot find out what is wrong with me, so I panic. I fear it is something worse. Then that panic spills over into my poor sleep hygiene and I struggle to sleep. This adds on to my trauma. Now, I fear going to bed because I fear I won’t get sleep (like when I only got 2-3 hours of light sleep). It seems my trauma *has* shifted.
 

 Anxiety sucks, but I’d love to hear your trauma. It helps me not feel so alone."
Hi! Anxiety sufferer for almost 14 years. I’ve recently noticed my Zoloft isn’t working anymore. I’m on 150mg a day. Has anyone else found this after being on a medication for a while? Do you build up a tolerance? Does it just stop working one day?
"Hi there
 

 I currently reside in Iowa. I am 30 and only now getting my license. I have sat the test twice and both times I failed. Once for incorrectly merging into a turning lane (those things are so fkn confusing) and then again today for going 30 in a 25 zone. It was only for a small moment and immediately corrected it!n(I was using a car I was a little unfamiliar with and the pedals can be a bit touchy) and she immediately failed me. Other than that I had made no mistakes. I don't know what to do as it has been taking forever to book appointments. I was lucky to even get an appointment today as all the places I call in Iowa that are near me, even some that are two hours out, are fully booked until march. 
 

 What are the things I will get an automatic failure on? 
 

 I am getting so stressed out and feel like a totally incompetent idiot for being 30 yrs old and unable to pass a driving test. I managed to book another test for next Saturday in a town that is a few hours away and if I fail this one I will tear my hair out haha. I have been practicing, getting lessons from a driving school that specializes in teach people with ADHD. People have told me I am ready and that the level I am at with driving means I should pass! It's overwhelming. I am trying my hardest and doing my absolute best.

"so I live in developing small country and therapy is no option in my area .I have anxiety which I can manage more or less when i am in my comfort zone 
 

 so 2 years ago I found courage and and went alone to the city which is about 5 hrs away from my small town to get professional help.i stayed there at my relative's place after several days of therapy I came to the city apartment and found out that my relative was going out and I had to stay alone at night.This is when I felt huge panic 
 

 1) I suddenly started to panic that the earthquake would happen and everything would be in ruins ( I was discussing earthquake phobia with my therapist that day)
 

 2) even if earthquake would not happen I would be in panic all night and would have to go to mental hospital bc if I called emergency they would think I was going crazy
 

 3) city neighbors who I knew personally ( would think that I was mentally ill and judge me harshly..yes I also have social anxiety
 

 the panic was so huge that I could not stay in the apartment and traveled back to home.I quit my therapy and never went back ..thankfully I did not have any panic attack after that but I will have to travel to the city again and even imagining myself in the same city all alone gives me huge panic.
 

 please give me your perspective: why did I have such irrational thoughts that night ? ( I was feeling very insecure and have earthquake phobia but it never gets that serious) I mean I never had such severe panic before ...does panic attack create irrational fears ?or irrational fears create panic ?
 

 2) how can I handle it if it happens again?"

"Hi all,
 

 I've suffered with social anxiety forever. I'm 33 years old with an unsupportive family and zero friends. I've been in all sorts of medication and tried counselling but so far nothing helps. I'm reluctant to try CBT due to having little faith that anything can help me anymore. I feel like I'm too set in my ways that it's sort of become my personality. 
 Anyway, although I've managed a few jobs in my life, I find everything mentally draining and overwhelming. I find myself constantly stressed, battling chronic daily headaches and constant irritability. It's affecting things with family. 
 I'm in the process of buying my own flat and because it's away from my current job, and I can't drive, I need to find another job. I can apply for things with ease but can't even get myself to answer phone calls. I feel like I can't work in social jobs or anything that talking on a phone would be a task. Does anyone have any ideas on jobs for those with social anxiety?"
My local mental health care team had an occupational therapist help me with my agoraphobia which has been over a year now and it's ending I want to get this oerson a gift for helping me but not sure if they will reject it because its there job so I'm not sure if should or not.
"Hey everyone. I’ve been trying to research exactly what anxiety or disorder I may have. My doctor deems it adhd, but I’ve always felt like it was something more. 
 

 Sorry if this is a long description I just want to explain it exactly how I feel it. My biggest issue is that my brain will never stop thinking about a never ending to-do list but I always feel too overwhelmed to do it due to its size or it’s just completely not realistic. For example, all I can think about is how I need to organize the bathroom better, paint the baseboards, organize the closets, change all cabinet doors bc I hate them, change all blinds bc I hate them too, oh the deck needs some work and when did I last have the gutters cleaned? I mean the list can go on for days. I can work towards a few but then the list has already grown with some other random things. I can’t rest or watch tv comfortably after work because I know things need to be done, but no one can get a list done that doesn’t stop. Adderall for my adhd does help boost my mood and make me less slumpy from the frustration weighing down. But it wears off in 2 hours (I’ve tried all extended releases) and I’m back to feeling like I’m on auto pilot to get through the day’s bare minimum tasks and overwhelmed. Then I go to bed and think about all the things I didn’t get done. This has taken a toll on my marriage as well, because I blame my husband for not helping me get a million tasks done a day. Even if he’s too tired to mop the floors one day, which is totally understandable, I’ll resent him for adding that to my list. We also argue a bit because I can’t understand why his brain isn’t like mine, “how do the baseboards not being perfectly white not bother you?” I can’t go out with friends for too long because I need to get back and clean or do something on my list. I just feel trapped. My brain doesn’t stop or turn off. Weed does help me at night to wind down, but it’s expensive and I cant do that during the day. Anyone else experience similar struggles?"

"Hi all, second post on this sub, sharing an update since the first post, I’ll share that below. Need help and support with where to go from here;
 

 Zoloft making things complicated …
 

 I am a 33 year old HLF and my boyfriend is a 37 year old LLM. He has been on Zoloft for about 3 years now after a slew of attempted treatments (other SSRIs, therapy, ECT) for anxiety, depression, and OCD, and it seems to be working for him, however, there is zero libido and to top it off, having that discussion has caused more anxiety surrounding any intimacy and touching in the bedroom.
 

 The treatment plan he currently is on from what he tells me is the best he’s felt in years, obviously except the bedroom. He’s trying, and I can see that. We touch in other ways, kisses, cuddling, hugs, but that’s where it stops. His anxiety surrounding sex has gotten increasingly bad to the point where I can’t initiate without feeling bad and feeling guilty, and then things get tense.
 

 When we first met, we were having sex constantly, and he wasn’t regularly taking his medication. Once I encouraged him to regularly be taking Zoloft as he should be doing so it can be affective, the sex drive tanked, so we know that’s the source of what’s going on.
 

 He invited me to hop on his appointment with his psychiatrist and the most advice they have offered is incorporating horny goat weed into his vitamin/medication regimen, which I have not seen any difference.
 

 I’m here hoping for any advice - any medications or supplements that may work, or any strategies. He is open to trying anything. The only area that he is resistant in is going to therapy, mostly because he’s had so many bad experiences with therapists throughout his life.
 

 

 —So now it being a few months later, it hasn’t changed at all. There is still kissing hugging and snuggling but that’s where it ends. No touching my body. Not even letting me touch his. I finally had the courage to be honest with where that’s left me mentally (rejected, feeling like it’s my fault) and he said that he doesn’t feel the physical attraction towards me and hinted at it being my physical body. Mind you, I’m pretty below average height and slightly over average weight so nothing crazy but I’ve historically had body image issues, so naturally that played right into my insecurities. He started going to therapy and acknowledged this might be because of the Zoloft (300 mg now) and his own self image and performance anxiety. But where do I go from here? He just destroyed any self confidence I had. It’s hard for me to wrap my head around not physically wanting me but wanting the companionship and support and loves me that way.
 

 Am I being stupid for staying? Not sure where to go from here… not sure how to feel. I feel like this will seriously affect our relationship moving forward as he know feels extremely anxious and guilty."

I have germaphobia, which I thought was from having my daughter and really bad ppa and ppd and then covid hitting, but turns out it is trauma induced. My therapist recent did testing for PTSD and turns out I have severe PTSD from my husband.  He yells at me constantly, calls me lazy, I am stupid, worthless, etc. He is a narcissist, mentally and emotionally abusive and has broken me down so bad. I am finally going through with serving him papers this week, but so scared. Trying to get a protective order, but not sure about one for my daughter, because he wouldn't hurt her, but afraid he will leave work in a rage and take her from daycare. They told me without anything in writing, he can. I am prepared for him to try and use the crazy card on me too for my germaphobia and other things, but I have been trying to seek help and such. They believe I won't get better while in this situation. He does a lot of this in front of my daughter as well. I tell him ,not I front of her, but then he says, well then it will never get fixed. He has slammed his fists on walls at his mom's house infront of both of them because I kept my daughter from using her toilet due to poop on the seat and I wanted it cleaned up first, but he said it didn't matter. I just wanted it clean, germaphobia or not. I am not sticking my child in poop. When I apologized to his mom about the situation, she said he is just frustrated with your germaphobia. I said he shouldn't be hitting walls and she just asked why. Like really? Of course, there is more. But it gets swept under the rug by his family. My daughter doesn't need to see this and learn this is ok. I am scared to move forward, especially with a newborn and I have no family here either. And some friends won't get back to me either. He keeps threatening divorce, that he would be happier with someone else, bags still packed from last time he left and came back, pushes for yet another baby, complains we don't have sex and mentioned maybe he should get somethingon the side, and everything is my fault. I feel alone, but trying to do better for my kids, just scared. Thank you for listening if you made it this far."
"Hey, I am not sure where else to ask, but I had an anxiety incident about a month ago that led me to have chest pains and numbness/tingling in my face and arms/hands. Since then, I started lexapro and have had a few blood tests(slightly high cholesterol and blood pressure, but nothing crazy). 
 

 However, I continue to have numbness and chest pain/tightness off and on throughout the day, usually starting when I wake up. It's driving me crazy and I just want to know if this is normal and something others have experienced or is it possible I am missing something. I never had physical symptoms from anxiety prior to that night."
"I'm 34 next month and I've been having heart worries for quite a few months now. Mainly cause of visible pulsations and sometimes some chest fluttering. I've noticed in the last few days some mild puffiness on my legs, on top of my shin bones and if I push on it it leaves a pit it's more on right leg than my left and it's not on my ankles.  
 I do remember having this 4 years ago too but it went away.  
 

 

 Anyone else had this?"
"Hi Everyone. I'm 32 years old and been struggling with travel anxiety since around 25. I don't understand why travelling causes me to feel like this as I haven't really had a bad experience or anything.
 

  There was a point where I was doing better and able to travel a fair bit but now I feel like I'm almost back to square one. I have seen my GP who prescribed Citalopram(10mg) daily.
 

  My main symptom is stomach upset and having to rush to the toilet (diarrhea). I have no stomach issues apart from when I'm travelling or when I know I'm gonna have to travel the next day.
 

  I think the furthest I have travelled in recent years is 40 mins away as the thought of going further sets everything off. It's really getting me down now as I feel like I can't visit places I want o'r attend events.
 

  I guess I'm just posting to see if any one has similar symptoms and how they manage it, and if they got better.
 

 Thanks for reading."
"Hello,
 

 A brief summary about me and my situation...
 

 I am 31 year old male who has struggled with anxiety since I was 16 (I can pinpoint the day my anxiety began...)
 

 When I was 16 in school, we were reading a play aloud as a class and for some unknown reason I suddenly began to get really nervous when reading lines. Most of my lines were just one or two at a time so I could get through it (just) and then I saw that my next block of lines was about three paragraphs...I began to panic more and more as my part was coming up, knowing that I was going to be reading so much and as I started reading, my mind went completely blank and I just couldn't bring myself to read anymore.
 

 I told the teacher I felt sick and ran out of the class to the bathroom and then onto the nurses room to be collected by my mum.
 

 From this moment onwards, I have struggled with any situation where there was an expectation for me to speak for a significant period time, be that a presentation, a story to friends (or anyone for that matter), explaining something at work, explaining ANYTHING in detail really.
 

 Over the years I hid myself away from all my friends with whom I gradually lost contact and although I had made some more friendships over the years, my 'speaking' anxiety led to me avoiding friends over and over until Im at a point now where I have no friends (and it's damn hard to make friends at 31!)
 

 Somehow through all of this, I've managed to hold down a good job and find a wife and raise two beautiful children.  
 

 I think a lot of my ability to maintain a 'normal' life has been as a result of taking Citalopram which has helped massively with my speaking anxiety. Not sure where I would be without it right now...probably about 400lbs playing Minecraft in my mum's basement!
 

 The problem is that I have been on this medication virtually constantly since I was 20 (every time I have tried to wean myself off, the anxiety creeps up back to my 16 year old levels).
 

 The irony in all of this is that on the face of it, I come across a very sociable guy and I am, but when I try to be my sociable self without the Citalopram, it's like there is an 'anxiety mask' that I can't remove, even though internally, I know there is no reason to be anxious.
 

 'Pre-16-years-old' I was one of the kids in school that everyone knew and was one of the 'popular' ones, and anxiety wasn't even something I had really ever experienced but my whole life and personality seemed to change in a split second after that day.
 

 My question is, is this social anxiety? I believe the answer is probably yes and if this is the case, how the hell do I move to overcome it? What have you guys done to overcome your social anxiety? I can get by when taking Citalopram, but I sure as hell don't want to be medicated for the rest of my life (god knows what the consequences of 50 years of taking Citalopram would do to your brain!)
 

 Thanks in advance everyone!"
"I'm surrounded by 2 camps: people who have completely blown COVID off since day 1, and people who are radically conscious to the point of extreme reclusion + shaming of anyone doing anything outside home. We fall in the middle; we do things and use public spaces....we just mask and try to be outside when possible. 
 

 Now CDC says there's no more distancing or quarantine required. I'm not looking for an excuse to ""get my life back"", but I'm getting harrowing and aggressive feedback from the recluse side. Warnings to not listen to CDC, to keep staying home, etc. I'm totally triggered.
 

 I've been lost for ages. I don't know what to think. Obviously this isn't over. But I'm avoiding those family who are lashing out right now. It's their prerogative of course, but I can't take that energy on.
 

 Will this ever be clear? Will there ever be consistency? And now monkeypox???"
"I don't even know where to post this at this point, if this is not the appropriate place for this, please let me know.
 

 I've (30M) started talking to a woman last Saturday over a dating app. It was a sort of last ditch effort, I wasn't expecting anything anymore, I just wanted to give it one last shot before I gave up entirely.
 

 We clicked on so many levels, it took me completely by surprise. We've been talking non-stop since then, sharing interests, memes, views, everything. It's unbelievable to me that I could ever get along this well with another human being.
 

 But she's not single, even though she stated this on her profile, alongside the fact that she's looking for a long-term, committed, monogamous relationship. She's in (her words) a situationship with a polygamous guy, a context which, she says, offers her nothing of what she'd need (she's monogamous, as am I). She says she doesn't know what to do, either, as she grew attached to the guy and, although it's causing her a great deal of confusion, she doesn't want to risk losing what she has with him over a bet with me. Yet she keeps repeating the idea that what she has with the other guy isn't a relationship.
 

 I've started falling for her. Hard. It scares me how much and how fast things are growing in me, I wasn't ready for this intensity. And it started eating me up inside because she says she isn't willing to give the other thing up yet, that she wants to get to know me better, to determine long-term compatibility, etc. But I feel like I'm dying. I've been thinking about this situation for two days straight, I've been crying my eyes out for fear of letting myself invest in this thing and it turning out to be absolutely nothing in the end. And she'll go on holiday with him in a couple of weeks, and that, I am absolutely certain, will send me into a tailspin like nothing else.
 

 And I can't stop thinking. I can't stop the fear, it feels like I'm drowning in my own thoughts and emotions and I'm not getting a moment's peace over it. I have no idea what to do, I've started doubting the validity of my feelings, even though they're there and they're killing me."
"My anxiety has been the worst it's ever been in my life. I haven't been able to sleep, things are triggering me that never did before. Daily panic attacks lasting for HOURS. I went to the local urgent care and they told me to go to the one that specializes in mental health because they didn't want to mess with meds they weren't familiar with. 
 

 I had a panic attack the entire drive in, and while waiting to see a provider. I saw a PA and she was amazing. Starting me on gabbapentin 3x a day and something to help me sleep. I feel hopeful for the first time in a long time. Fingers crossed the gabbapentin helps! (If anyone has success stories from taking it, I would love to hear them). I felt like a crazy person going into the mental health urgent care but I knew it was what I needed. I just hope I can get fixed and back to a normal life asap."
"This is going to be a long read, but this is AAA, top shelf, existential dread we're dealing with. There are few fears that you will ever contend with that surpass it. I hope my story helps you learn from my mistakes, and conquer this fear. **DO NOT LET THAT FEAR FESTER!** 
 

 

 I struggled with this fear most my life (31M) and I know the very physical feeling you're trying to alleviate. Its awful while it lasts, but if you have a healthy brain, it won't tolerate self-induced mental stress and that's where the neurotransmitter GABA comes in, and its job is to distract you, this is why (if you're healthy) you aren't literally crippled/killed by existential anxiety. It always passes. 
 

 

 I never had to address the root of the anxiety. So long as I didn't fully contemplate the idea of oblivion I could avoid that terror and pain. Just mentioning the concept or glossing over it wasn't an issue, it was the deep reflection on the implications that would do me in, hence I learned to avoid that contemplative subject all together.
 

 

 Due to some bad dietary experimentation, I set off a course of events that forced me to deal with the anxiety I had turned away from for decades. I woke up one day and something was very wrong, I couldn't describe it then, but the symptoms were clear. 
 

 

 Everything that once brought me joy was dull and gray. Not one aspect of my life held any value anymore. Forget doing anything unpleasant. Lost my job immediately because I literally couldn't be left alone with my thoughts without **completely** losing it.
 

 

 I would consider eating, watching tv, playing a game, my hobbies, etc, and none of it sparked any desire in my mind, and I knew then I was in deeeep shit.
 

 

 With nothing to occupy myself or look forward too, it too all of 1 hour before ""that fear"" reared its head again, only this time my brain isn't prepared **AT ALL.** 
 

 

 Unbeknownst to me at the time, I was experiencing extreme neuro-transmitter imbalance and ""that fear"" wasn't going to go away for over 40 days....Over 40 days of hell I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy...
 

 

 Everyday was non-stop panic attacks. I would wake up in a sweat everyday, heart racing, body aching. I would later learn (*when my kidneys began shutting down*) that the body pain was caused by cortisol eating my muscle tissue (*cortisol floods your body following adrenaline spikes, like when you're in fight or flight mode 24/7*).
 

 

 Nothing could bring me any relief outside of being unconscious. Any substance made the anxiety orders of magnitude worse. I couldn't even drink (*a blessing in disguise*). 
 

 

 I learned to love sleep and I did my best to take care of myself outside of it and hold onto hope that I could figure out what was wrong with me and get healthy again, but in the back of my mind the practical voice couldn't be silenced...
 

 

 *""No matter how well I'm holding on now, I can't live like this indefinitely...""*
 

 

 I was in no way suicidal, but I'm no fool, I knew I was on a clock, and I needed to figure this out fast. Without going into the horrendous incompetence and mistreatment from the psychiatrist, I'll sum up by saying western medicine and psycho-therapy failed me. The doctors treated my kidney damage, and for that I'm grateful, but had I not taken my diagnosis into my own hands, I'm certain I'd be dead.
 

 

 Remember the whole time, on a loop, is the terrorizing thought that I'm going to die, probably soon, and my consciousness will cease to exist. It was nothing short of torture.
 

 

 At one point I went to stay with my mother, I couldn't be alone, and my brother was leaving town creating a large gap in the rotating list of family and friends that stayed with me nearly 24/7 (*another blessing I don't take for granted*). She was currently caring for my grandma who had been diagnosed with liver cancer. 
 

 

 After my first night there, I awoke the following morning, panic stricken and physically crippled, per my new norm, to my mother bursting through the door to the guest room crying her eyes out telling me the hospital called, it was time to come say goodbye. She was too distraught to drive, and asked me to take her. 
 

 

 I knew I couldn't handle this in my current state. I'll never forget looking my mother in the eyes and telling her I couldn't do it...I wasn't capable...
 

 

 Now, my eldest brother lives in the same town and was able to pick our mother up on his way to the hospital. Then I was alone. Laying there. Heart beating out of my chest. In agony over my failure. Thinking about not getting to say goodbye to my grandmother, of my family shattered (*she was our matriarch, our ""glue""*). Then ""IT"" was there. 
 

 

 **I want to preface the next part by making it clear I have never been a religious man, nor am I today,** at least in the conventional sense. If anything, I'm the king of cynical scepticism. 
 

 

 As I lay there, something made its presence known in my mind. It's hard to describe this experience, but the best I can do is imagine having a second consciousness in your mind, that feels VERY foreign/strange/novel. Like hearing the voice in your head but its not your voice and its not following your thoughts and impulses. 
 

 

 It communicated with me, not with words or pictures, but like, impressions, and feelings, and the deal was crystal clear in my mind. It offered to alleviate all that plagued me, in exchange for me getting to the hospital and being there for my family, who would definitely be needing me (*im the goto rock*). It was too clear to argue what was happening to me, and I agreed...
 

 

 **Instant euphoric relief.** I got dressed and began racing for the hospital...For one day, I was myself again.
 

 

 I didn't get to say goodbye...believe me when I tell you that I felt her pass as I drove down the highway. Seconds later my mother called me sobbing and confirming what I already knew. I continued and made it to the hospital and fulfilled my end of the bargain.
 

 

 Once all was said and done I went to be alone for a moment in the chapel (*what else do you do when you've just completed a transaction with a seemingly extra-dimensional being*).
 

 

 I didn't know what to think at first, but I could no longer deny, there is **SOMETHING** else out there. Something that cares deeply about us. I met it. I made a deal with it, but I wasn't out of the woods with my condition, but from that day forward, it got better everyday. The next day I figured out what had happened to my brain, how it happened, and how to correct it.
 

 

 I started getting healthier, enough to function, and I had something to work on now. Being the sceptic I am I still wanted more evidence. I kept digging.
 

 

 I dove head first into all things death. Reincarnation accounts from children, near death experiences, medical miracles, etc. Exposure therapy works, and the writing was everywhere. I found far more evidence suggesting the existence of consciousness independent of the body, than I did against it. Then I had a groundbreaking revelation one night after a particularly strange and removed dream.
 

 

 In the dream I was in an unknown place, with unknown people, doing unknown things. Common features for most dreams. Then immediately upon waking and recalling the foreign reality of the dream it hit me.
 

 

 Despite being separated from all that I am, my memories, friends, family, and experiences...I still held onto that quintessential feeling of ""I am myself"". 
 

 

 Ive heard it said before that sleep is practice for death, and it makes more sense to me now.
 

 

 The thought of oblivion is still terrifying, but I have gotten braver, knowing what I know. So now it's scary like the dark can be scary. It's largely unknown, yes, but highly unlikely to contain the things the mind imagines it does.
 

 Obviously I can't recommend a viable course to communing with extra-dimensional beings, but I highly recommend investigating and exposing yourself to death and all that we have observed about it and consciousness.
 

 

 Hope this story helps you."
"I (32F) have social anxiety. It’s something I’ve had for years and have had counselling and medication for, but the problem I face most is that my mind runs blank pretty much all day, every day. As you can imagine, this makes it pretty hard for me to converse (even moreso that I have a brain AVM in the insula, which is responsible for generating speech).
 

 I get on amazingly well with my boyfriend (38M), but I get super anxious having phone or video calls with him because I have barely anything to say, and I get embarrassed about it. I end up coming off the phone thinking ‘that was horrible’. No matter how hard I try, I can’t maintain eye contact either and I’m pretty sure my anxiety is very noticeable.
 

 He understands about my anxiety and says he loves me all the same, but this is sometimes so crippling for me. I feel like I wouldn’t be anxious if I knew what to say, but I can’t force my brain to think of anything.
 

 I have perpetual fatigue and brain fog, so I know this won’t be helping my case.
 

 TL;DR: Struggling to overcome social anxiety in social situations with my other half because it feels like my brain just won’t function."
"I’m 30m and was just prescribed this medication, after having a bout with medically related anxiety that just has not gone away. My main anxiety issue is intrusive thoughts. I’ve always had them but since they have been labeled I’ve been way more aware of them. 
 

 I’m EXTREMELY nervous to start it. I’m a father of 2 very young children and a SAHM, they rely on me for everything. My concern or question is has anyone taken this medication that use to take adderol, i was on adderol for about 5 years from about 13-18. I was prescribed lexapro a handful of years back and only remember having side effects so bad that i threw them away. 
 

 Another symptom i have is like a nervous twitch where i shake my feet which i haven’t heard anyone else talking about. Anyone see any improvement with that? 
 

 I appreciate any information either in this threat or in a direct message. Thanks in advance."
"Just as a side note, I got a bunch of stuff tested for last year with cardio stuff just cause I was super anxious about it. 
 

 I'm up right now, because my left forearm is going on and off with some slight pain and I had a slight pain under my left breast. This all started with my wrist hurting earlier. It gave me anxiety. I went to bed and now I've woke up with the other symptoms. My car battery is dead atm so I'm just at my bfs house. 
 

 I'm sure it's nothing but I feel so paranoid and since my car needs a new battery, I feel extra paranoid. I just wish the pain would stop so I'd feel ok. 32f btw. 
 

 

 Ughhhhh"

"31M I have been finally diagnosed with the anxiety disorder a while ago. Namely, I went through a horrific period of my life last year, losing a younger sibling and I suppose the mechanisms I used to deal with it were all but effective. In March of this year I started experiencing tingling in my feet, sometimes, but rarely in my hands too. The tingling was severe back then, but kind of mild now, however always there. I believe I also developed health anxiety as I have been to every doctor under the sun trying to get my diagnosis, ranging from fearing leukemia to multiple sclerosis. My neurologist concluded all that was about was my anxiety and sent me off to therapy. I am yet to find a decent therapist but my tingling is just omnipresent and I convinced myself that there is no way for the physical manifestation of anxiety to last for six months straight even when I don't feel particularly stressed. I just fear it might be something way worse.. Has anyone had issues like this? Long term tingling caused by anxiety? I am just so overwhelmed.."
"Hi everyone, I'm new to the subreddit but not to anxiety. I'm 32 and suffered since I was a kid from social anxiety disorder, GAD, and panic attack disorder. I get overwhelmed over anything especially when things change. I'm exceptionally bad at coping and it even manifests as chronic pain physically. They've given me 6 or 7 different antidepressants and anxiolytics over the years, but they don't seem to really help at all.
 

 Also, as I get older, things are getting worse because I'm supposed to be financially stable and I'm far from it. I used to be in a PhD program in mathematics which caused me to burn out and even temporarily enter some sort of psychosis, which wasn't properly diagnosed and caused me to quit my career and get a divorce. That was 2 years ago. I since recovered and switched jobs, but I have not adapted to the anxiety and stress of the new job, and it seems I never will, even though it shouldn't be as stressful as I'm making it.
 

 Does anyone have suggestions for jobs that I can do while I get additional help? I'm fine with part-time work right now, but I would like to find something I can do at my own pace or that allows for a good work-life balance. As mentioned, my main ""job"" experience has simply been being a student, involved in education and academics. Therefore, teaching math seems to be the only type of job that makes sense, but social anxiety makes that feel like pulling teeth daily. Until my doc can find a med for me that works or I somehow magically get better, I'm not sure what type of work is best for me."
"Im about to be 35 weeks pregnant. I have a two year old. People have mentioned they notice the abuse, especially his family, but no one will say or do anything. I have trauma induced germaphobia and now documented PTSD from him, too. I keep getting confidence to leave then chicken out because I am scared and don't think I can take care of two kids, especially a newborn by myself. I have talked to a lawyer, I do have a therapist, no family here, so feel alone in this. I am trying to move forward, but it scares me as I get closer to due date. My family wants nothing to do with him either until he gets help snd does marriage counseling, which he refuses and thinks is a joke. Some people call him a narcissist, which I believe. I get yelled at constantly, even in front of my daughter. Blames everything on my germaphobia and how I have treated him with it all since she was born. Everything is my fault. I feel so lost."
"I (30M), have been invited out to drinks tomorrow after work. The last time I've went out for drinks was nearly two months ago and I was taken advantage of by a taxi driver (money extortion) because I had drank way too much. I've really enjoyed being sober for two months and I just know that tomorrow night will be another night of drinking. I'm anxious of what may happen tomorrow night and I'm also considering bailing altogether. 
 

 What would you do if you were in a similar situation? Any advice or tips?"
"I'm 31 and new to anxiety. I don't feel anxious at all, actually. Only about the symptoms that I have been told by several doctors and some kind EMT staff. Some of my symptoms are so distressing that I want to cry out for help thinking I'm having a medical emergency, or that I can't stand the feeling and idk what to do.
 

 My ""normal"" is dealing with stiff shoulders and a constant sense of dizziness/pressure in the back half of my head. Occasionally, the dizziness escalates to an alarming level, or I'll get a very intense headrush, followed by about an hour of increased heart rate, weakness, tremors and feeling very cold or very hot. Today I was stretching my neck and suddenly it felt like a bunch of tingling needles were racing up to the top of my head. I had to stand up from my computer chair at work and grip the desk. My eyes went huge as I tried to 'ride out' the feeling without alarming anybody (I work in a busy ophthamology office where there are many patients, including seniors and children, already dealing with their own crises, and I'm supposed to be calm and trustworthy.) My face tingled like crazy, especially around my cheeks and eyes. My boss was nice enough to let me go into the lunchroom and turn the lights off, which sort of kinda helped. It's been about 6 hours since that event and I still feel weak and tingly. My normal resting BPM of 75 shoots up to 100-110 and then hovers at 90-100 for like two hours afterward.
 

 Another possible related symptom - brief, sharp headaches in the back right side of my head, right near the base of my skull. I constantly feel the urge to rotate my head around or press on the back of my neck, too.
 

 Is this really anxiety? Do any of you folks have similar symptoms? How tf do you deal with it? Doctors have been no help - just 'drink water and avoid stressful situations'.
 

 I've tried taking magnesium glycinate after reading some people's good experiences with it but it hasn't seemed to make a difference. I try to do deep breathing when it gets bad but it doesn't help either - I have no trouble breathing while experiencing this stuff.
 

 Edit Sept 7: Went to the ER today and was referred to a vestibular and orthopaedic rehab centre. Hopefully they can help. My symptoms have not improved since posting this."
"My anxiety can get to the point where I feel I just can't function. And I know I can't work, but my brain wonders if I am just weak or if I use anxiety as an excuse.
 

 How can so many of us still show up to work and yet I take so many mental health days.
 

 Yes I am crying through the day. But is it because I let myself get to this point or because my anxiety is that high?
 

 Do you call out sick often? How do you know if you can deal with it or if you need to call out sick?"
"My mind is spinning out trying to figure out how to protect myself (31f) whilst dating someone (30f) who is having major anxiety issues. 
 

 We started dating about 4 months ago, first few months were great. All going in the right direction. There’s a fair bit of distance between us because of where we both live but I’m in her area regularly and she even came to visit me. 
 

 Three weeks ago she took on a big business project and is also still working full time at another job. she’s under a lot of stress to get it all sorted and it’s made her anxiety go through the roof. At first I just noticed she was not responding to texts much, not showing any interest in me - all the sweet messages about missing me etc had stopped. I was mega triggered but kept my head on and eventually did ask what was up. She said about being stressed etc. then I went down for my visit and she didn’t want to be anywhere near me, very few hugs, none of the usual cuddles or holding hands or any intimacy at all, she was barely talking to me. I suffered through the trip feeling sad and on the last night said we need to talk and she was great, gave her full attention and she explained she just feels completely shut down and she’s used to going through this on her own etc I said a lot of the right things I think and said let’s just take it easy till she gets through this tough period. Now I’m back home and she’s not really talking to me etc and I’m trying to learn about sever anxiety and just keep my head on about it. 
 

 But I’m hurting and I feel like my feelings don’t matter in this relationship anymore. The anxiety is completely taking over everything and I don’t know how to support her, how to support myself or when/ if things will go back to how they were. Do I just have to wait this out and talk about it all once this anxiety of hers calms down? Should I be talking about my feelings now? I’m worried that will stress her more. Will this get better? At what point do I have to just look out for myself and walk away? I want to make it through this."

"I'm agoraphobic and have a dentist appointment tomorrow. Well, today I guess since it just passed midnight where I am... I have intense anxiety going just about anywhere, but especially the doctor's office and I've been avoiding the dentist like the plague because I just feel like it's way worse than a regular doctor, I feel like I will feel more ""trapped"". I'm 34 and haven't had my teeth cleaned or fillings or anything since I was about 17. My 2 upper wisdom teeth are in fine, but both have a huge facial hole in them. 🤦🏼‍♀️ I know they'll have to come out, and I'm not even as scared of that because when I had my bottom wisdom teeth out, it went great, I had some awesome med they gave me prior to the appointment and they put me to sleep so it was all good. I get tooth pain from those upper wisdom teeth and other molars periodically, so I know I've got cavities and something has to be done before it gets super bad... not sure why I'm going into such detail, but yeah.. I had a panic attack just calling to make the appointment last week, so I'm hardcore dreading it now =/
 

 Wish me luck, good vibes, prayers, whatever your thing is. Thanks guys 😬"
"My severe anxiety the past 6 months has killed my libido. So then because I'm still having severe anxiety I start worrying that maybe its not the anxiety killing my libido maybe its the relationship. And then I worry about trapping myself and my partner in a passionless relationship forever. And that makes the anxiety more severe. Which further kills my libido.
 

 Has anyone else ever experienced something like this?
 

 Did you eventually get your 'mojo' back?"
"I've been having crying spells, difficulties sleeping and eating, feeling unreal, panic attacks ...
 

 I'm no stranger to anxiety. I've had it since I was 15 (F34) and I know when I need more help
 

 His reply?
 

 Well, you are already on a good medication and your psychiatrist increases it last week, so I think we should wait. Anxiety takes time, you know? There's no magic pill that would take the anxiety away. You have to do things like meditation, and yoga...
 

 Me: yeah I tried. It's not working.
 

 Dr: What do you want me to do? What were you hoping I'd do?
 

 

 I couldn't believe him. I'm highly unstable right now and having dysphoria and other symptoms since February. I finally decide I need medication for my anxiety and I get an ""anxiety takes time"" speech?
 

 I called him out on being dismissive and not even bodering to read my file. He would know I have had this happened before and I know that ""anxiety has no magical cure"".
 

 No shit. 
 

 He was like oh how am I dismissive? I'm not doing that. I told him if he didn't understand he needed to take a look at his patient treatment.
 

 Got the notes for time off work and ativan (which he says is addictive and why he didn't want to prescribe it). Maybe if I had been treated like a responsible human being who is in pain and need help we would have reached the same conclusion without me breaking down during and after the appointment. 
 

 I can't believe this. 
 

 Am I doing something wrong? I left that appointment feeling completely hopeless and alone, like there is nothing and no one that cares."
"The dentists made it seem trivial like expect pain..That i am prepared for and i did send an email to reconfirm like what I need to do because i need to for my anxious mind lol they were just like pop 2 ibuprofen before appointment.
 

 The dentist assistant told me there will be general anesthesia and to be on full stomach because after i probably will have a early bedtime. So cool.. until I'm like wait is general anesthesia just numbing or more? What does it meannn? Will i be feeling everything?
 

 I'm freaking out because i don't know anyone that has had their wisdom teeth removed. And i really should've asked my dentist because the assistant wasn't fully sure.
 

 Please tell me your experience and advices on how to prep. What is expected. And tell me to chillax.. lol"
I know why. Trauma. I've figured out a lot about myself over the years and understand why I feel the way I do. But how does one feel safe in society after people humiliated and bullied him for 10 years.
"So I just had a quick check up with my doctor and I told him that my anxiety has gotten really bad lately.
 Always negative and irritated at the world so he said he would prescribe me Buspirone I have never heard of it but he said it should help and I’m desperate at this point. My question is has anyone used it? And does it help with anxiety?"
"I (32M) have started dating someone with severe anxiety. They've been pretty open and honest about their anxiety, but I want to make sure that I can be the best partner for them. As I've never dated anyone with extreme anxiety, I'm not entirely sure if there are things that they haven't mentioned that I need to be cognizant of, or be more intentional about, or if I should just treat it as all of my other relationships.  
 

 

 I do want to emphasize that I don't find their anxiety taxing, or exhausting or stressful, I really like this person and I really want to be the best partner for them."
"I'm sure most people know this here but I wanted to post something just to break the seal and get active here.
 

 I used alcohol for so long to suppress my SA and I got sober recently. Now I am 30 years old and I am having to come to terms with how anxious I actually am and that I am just as anxious as I was a dozen years ago because I never actually addressed it, I just kept powering through social events by drinking.
 

 I don't think this applies to everyone, I know not everyone abuses alcohol. But if you find yourself needing to drink to get through social situations, I would highly suggest finding ways to actually address the problem head on instead of sweeping it under the rug with booze.
 

 Now I am going to therapy and also challenging myself in baby steps to continue putting myself through situations that make me uncomfortable and I am doing it without alcohol. I am gay and have gone out to gay clubs now sober and surprised myself in that it actually felt better than being too drunk to be fully present like I normally would have been in the past. I thought I would never be able to do anything like that sober.
 

 So I do think it is possible to keep SA at bay through a lot of work and a lot of becoming comfortable with being uncomfortable. For me, the anticipation of situations that make me anxious is always far worse than actually being in those situations. And I keep surprising myself by adding to the list of accomplishments I never thought I could do without the help of alcohol.
 

 I just wish I had started this process earlier because there's a long road ahead of me to where I want to be in regards to my SA and I didn't make a bit of progress on it for most of my life so far because I chose to drink and pretend it didn't exist."
"I (32m) am new to this sub reddit, but I've always dealt with anxiety and it took a very abusive marriage that gave me plenty of insecurities and PTSD from to develop some self destructive tendencies. For instance, I would have an amazing date and I would find some way to sabotage that relationship subconsciously. Almost like I was looking for something to ruin it. I am currently seeing a therapist and starting on anxiety medication as well to try and tackle these issues. I've successfully worked through what my ex wife did to me, but my coping mechanisms are still there (shutting down, finding flaws so I won't get hurt and stuff like that)
 

  My question to everyone is what have you found that helps you not focus on your own insecurities and to let a relationship just happen? My issue is I tend to date women who I can't see myself marrying because it's unintentionally been my way to cope and to not get hurt during a relationship. In a nut shell my insecurities ruined an amazing relationship and I'm trying to not let that happen again in the future.
 

  Normally I would ask this on a relationship sub reddit, but I believe anxiety, OCD tendencies and just fixating on issues go hand in hand."
"I have pretty bad social anxiety, to the point that I'm 30 and have no friends or life outside work and I avoid any social interaction that I can. But I've had my first therapy session and wondering if anyone else that can relate has any thoughts on if therapy helped them or not."
"TW: thoughts of ending existence 
 

 I (30m) have been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was 7-8 years old. Around 5 years ago my anxiety shifted to including hypochondria and ever since its been a nightmare. Past two years have been amazing since I took many steps for bettering my mental health but tonight has got me feeling like I'm slipping back down very rapidly. Despite having the desperation and motivation to better both my mental and physical health, there's no drive for the physical aspect. It feels as if despite not wanting to die and no longer having suicidal thoughts I'm doing it subconsciously, and I feel powerless against it. Everything I have strived so hard to achieve mentally seems like it's slipping away in a downward spiral with no end in sight. 
 

 Tonight is the alarm that made me fully aware, I found a superficial clot in my arm and instantly had a couple panic attacks. Blood clots absolutely terrify me and is what caused the onset of hypochondria so to discover one today, even if miniscule and self resolving, is one of my biggest fears. I've been trying my damnedest to keep myself from letting anxiety take control but it's hard when I'm 200 miles away from my saftey net that is my room and primary doctor visiting family. I know that even if my doctor tells me not to worry it the anxiety will only get worse, and if I talked to my family ill only end up feeling brushed off causing the spiral to go down at light speed.
 

 I seriously can not take this anymore, I feel like I'm losing and destined to be consumed by anxiety and depression. Despite having plans to see someone to talk to about it I feel like I'm alone when it comes to my family. I'm in a state of being both level headed and a complete mess and I feel powerless to change it. It hurts knowing that even as I watch my youngest nephew learn to walk my only thought have been about whether I will make it to 31.
 

 I Apologize in advance if I don't make sense, or rambled on but I desperately needed to put to words how I feel. 
 

 TLDR; having medical issues that are triggering my anxiety severely, and can't think of how to cope."
"If you have crippling social anxiety and want to change that, don't be like me.
 

 A year ago I was so sick and tired of being an introvert with sa and determined to overcome my fear of public speaking. 
 

 I read a bunch of self-help books that encouraged me to get out of my comfort zone and take ""massive action"". I was so pumped and so ready to charge right at a big challenge and change myself once and for all. I signed up for multiple public speaking opportunities at conferences, meetings and seminars in front of hundreds of people. I made sure I know the topics well and I rehearse multiple times before the speeches. 
 

 But man did I fail horribly. I was all shaking before I got on the stage. I sweat, stumbled, froze, brain went blank. I skipped a whole section of a speech. I ended up having to make up a bunch of excuses just to get myself off the remaining speeches. The shame haunted me for 6 good months and I avoided talking to people, even my friends. I even went to therapy for it. 
 

 Don't be stupid like me. Don't destroy your mental health for your growth. Take baby steps. Be strategic with your time, opportunities and energy. Some changes take consistent and patient work, over months even years. 
 

 I also realized that the area outside of my comfort zone is more complex than I thought. Kudos to you if you have the courage to step outside of your comfort zone. You can find growth there, but there's also a panic zone you want to steer clear from."
"I'm (m31) and I have GAD. I can really struggle with my high anxiety at times. I have a hard time dealing with not so much intrusive or racing thoughts but the physical symptoms that anxiety or panic attacks come with especially the dizziness or feeling faint or the consistent head aches which has led to me have a fair amount of health anxiety in the past. Dont get me wrong I've had weeks or even the odd month where my anxiety doesnt really act up and I feel much calmer. Now the two best things I do to handle when my anxiety is really out of control is I take a hit bath with a herbal tea, or I smoke CBD. I smoke it because it's pretty much instantaneous and I can control my dosage as opposed to other methods of taking it. Ive also been working on accepting when my anxiety is high and riding the wave until I calm down. I'm just here to ask what works for other people And what do other people do for their anxiety"

"This is just a thanks to everyone sharing their struggles with social anxiety. I'm 30 and no one around me has experienced social anxiety the way I have and sometimes made me doubt myself even more because they ""just got over it"" and I couldn't but reading all of these posts has made me feel not so alone in the world for the first time in a long time. So just know, you've all helped me, even just a little bit."
"30M here living in a smaller city, I have long hair and a beard but have a super slight frame. But I cannot go anywhere in public alone without someone getting mad at me for existing. I've heard such gems as ""Who let you out?"" ""I paid good money so I don't have to look at eyesores like you"" and my personal favourite ""You know there are families here, right?""
 

 I don't dress provocatively, mostly just plain t-shirts and jeans, I keep to myself and generally try to stay as invisible as possible as to not attract ire but all I can tell is that I don't have any friends therefore they must think I deserve to be an outcast.
 

 I'm really running out of ideas, it's gotten to the point where I don't even want to get out of bed, nothing is appealing anymore."
"Full of anxious thoughts. Worried that my latest med won't work. Worried that I didn't say enough or discuss the right things at my first Psychiatry apt. Worried that I'm going to be running out of options. Worried that anxiety every single day is going to be my normal. Unable to enjoy anything or be around anyone. 
 

 Some days I can be everyone's biggest supporter. Other days I feel like I need to be left alone because I'm spending every last bit of energy I have just trying to stay alive. 
 

 I don't think Lexapro helps with intrusive thoughts and that's the biggest source of my anxiety. I time out taking my gabapentin for work for the time I'll need it the most because it doesn't last 6 hours anymore and I don't know why. This isn't fair. I have to be to work at 8 and I'm dreading it- but I can't be at home. The noises in the house are too much for me and there are just too many people here. I just want to be alone but also have someone lay with me in bed and hold me because this shit is the hardest shit I've ever dealt with."
"I (31f) have recently been experiencing extreme anxiety over communication apps and social media has become a trigger for my anxiety. I can't get myself to open the GMAIL or Facebook or LinkedIn apps on my phone or PC. I keep feeling like something bad will happen if I do and am scared to be seen on the apps. I work in recruitment and one of the first things that help me to do my job are all those apps above. People at work are noticing and asking why I am not active but I just can't make myself do it. 
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Has anyone else experienced this? And, if you did, what did you do to manage and overcome it?"
"Hi Guys,
 

 I recently had an apparent panic attack, well several panic attacks. I was in the gym and I simply had this weird head rush and felt like I wasn't really in my body - not heavy weights, 45min in and finishing on some light bits. Hard to breath etc all the usual things. Went to ER and given the call clear.
 

 I've been on 25mg of Sertraline for 4 weeks now, and I think it has somewhat helped with the constant anxiety/stress, I feel like there is slightly less adrenaline in my body overall. 
 

 But I had a call with the doctor today and they increased my dose to 50mg, I had some food and about an hour afterwards I had the same head rush. No elevated heart rate, not really any other symtpom other than light headedness/out of body feeling and that feeling has come and gone all day. Throw in a bit of fear when the rush happens as I think its the end.
 

 My question is, does anyone else get just this feeling? In my mind now, trying not to convince myself I have a brain tumour.
 

 I'm 33 male."
"I've somehow mustered some courage to go out in a date using a dating app. What I found comforting to my SAD is that I try not to think about the date. At all. Like everytime, my brain starts wandering in my vast imagination on how the date will happen, I stop myself and think of something else. It helps me alleviate a lot of pre-date stress.  
 

 

 So I meet the girl, everything is going great, we're having a good time. Until.. she started flirting, eyelocking me, asking me random questions to see how I would react. I think she picked up on my nervousness. I literally became a mess the moment, I started thinking : ""She likes me"".
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Anyway, long story short, we spend 5 hours together, and I fail during that to flirt ( I can't flirt, its scary as fuck ) or ask for something more physical like a kiss or more. Then she got bored, and went home. I clearly said I have social anxiety and some issues with sexuality, and she still pushed for sex on the first night, and made me feel guilty the next morning by saying : ""you clearly have issues, we won't see each other again"".  
 

 

 I just wanna say : fuck social anxiety so hard. I hope you all get past it."
"I’ve recently had thought about what my future holds.. what happens when someone gets elderly and has no kids… no family to take care of them? Will I end up in an elderly assisted care facility miserable? This is such a sad and depressing that and it honestly scares me. 
 

 I do have a long term bf, we consider ourselves domestics partners, we have just chosen not to marry. And we do not want kids, ( we have 3 dogs that we consider our kids). I am very introverted, as well as have social anxiety, maybe even some other undiagnosed disorders honestly. I have not been able to get employed in the past 3 years, as my social anxiety prevents me from doing such simple tasks.. I cannot even get myself to go to an interview. My grandmother and mother passed away about 3 years ago, leaving me an inheritance that I’ve been able to manage my life.. for now. That gives me such guilt and worry that this is unsustainable long term and what will happen to me at an older age when I am no longer able to cover my bills. I am lucky that my bf does work full time, is able to do all the things I cannot, and does financially contribute. But again, long term, when we are old, what does this look like for us. This just absolutely terrifies me"
"For the last 2 years I’ve (33F) been struggling with anxiety to a level where I just lose it when pushed too far. It could be a delayed flight, work stress related issues or a misinterpretation from my partner and I just want to self harm me, accuse my partner of being antagonistic and have made horrible and embarrassing scenes in restaurants. 
 I was going to therapy but it didn’t help much, maybe because of the psychologist approach where we were just chatting but I had no exercises to practice on. 
 I took antidepressants but all I wanted to do was to sleep all day. 
 My partner is really scared our relationship just won’t have a future if I don’t get better and I totally understand but I just don’t know what to do. 
 I’ve heard that cognitive behavioral therapy is great. What do you think? Is there any book or podcast that you could recommend me?"
"Can someone share that when you are extremely anxious or troubled your body feels it’s dizzy, vibrations like it would shake but it doesn’t. Is it a medical condition or anxiety?

For starters I have never been diagnosed. But I 32m know for a fact I have ADHD. Also diagnosed depression PTSD Anxiety. Tried countless meds but only for the depression and and anxiety. Should I ask about any medication for ADHD?! Will it benefit me? Or will I just be hurting myself? I’m at a loss. Thank you In advance.
"The last few months I’m constantly fucking up. My memory and focus seem to be failing me. My boss scheduled a meeting to tell me he thinks something is wrong because I have clearly started doing the bare minimum (I’m not trying to, I just keep fucking up because I can’t remember anything or focus during meetings). Even in my personal life I’m constantly making mistakes. I don’t know if something more serious is going on or how worried I should be."
"Hi guys,
 

 I don't if this is the correct subreddit for this question, but I'm with a little trouble with my driving license. 
 

 I'm 32 years old and only last year I started to take out the theory exam because of financial problems. I was so excited to finally start taking driving lessons. 
 

 I started with the first instructor and he screamed in every lesson that I had with him. Of course, I talked with the school and change the instructor. This one is cool and gives me some cool tips, but...when I'm driving...my head is not on the road. My focus is horrible, I keep forgetting everything about how to drive, like looking at the traffic lights, etc. 
 

 I always had this trouble, even if I'm studying to elevate my career. Even in my house, etc. Lack of focus, and concentration, and keep forgetting things. 
 

 But now as I'm driving this worries me a lot. I don't want to put the lives of the people on the line.
 

 And I don't know what it can be...
 

 I tried to talk with a psychiatrist, but she said she couldn't see what was wrong with me. But how can I become comfortable if I'm always forgetting something?"
"I'm a pretty serious hypochondriac. You name it and at some point, I've been convinced it was killing me. My major fears are neurological illnesses, particularly dementia. I'm 33 years old.
 

 Today I got asked to run an errand, it was out of the blue and really interrupted my day. I was already in an anxiety spiral when I got asked. I ended up having to rush through my workout, shower, and hop in the car. 
 

 The place I was going was just off a road I drive all the time, like 2-3 times a week at least. I do delivery work on the side so I do a LOT of driving. 
 

 When I left, I knew where I needed to go and what road to take. But for some reason I placed the road I needed to turn on in the wrong area, like a mile away from where it actually is. I planned the route in my head and could see myself making that (wrong) turn and it being the correct road. It was not.
 

 I drove that way, was distracted and drove past this wrong street. When I turned around to come back to it, I realized it was the wrong road. I got confused and panic hit me. I ended up just heading back to a nearby main road to reorient and realized what I'd done wrong and sort of parsed out the way I needed to go.
 

 This ended up setting off a real panic because for a minute there I was truly, genuinely confused about how I'd screwed up and which way to go. However, I drive the area all the time! The road I needed is one I take about 3 times a week.
 

 Has anyone else done anything like this? I've asked people I know but they just say ""oh yea I drive past my turn all the time"". What I'm talking about isn't that, I literally could visualize the correct road and knew I needed it but put it in the wrong place and went there!
 

 Just need to vent to others that get it. Could the fact that I was already anxious about other stuff have caused this? Does your anxiety ever produce confusion?"

"\*TW: Discussion of depression, neurodivergence, trauma\*  
 TLDR: Feeling overwhelmed by changes in husband's ADHD-like behavior, working through silent anxious-depressive struggle to respect boundaries. No clear path for relief.  
 

 

 Let me start with a disclaimer: I am not a psychiatrist. I am venting from a place of desperate, suppressed frustration. My suppositions are based on public research/articles and chats with my therapist and friends. I also love and adore my husband, while simultaneously going through this struggle.  
 ...
 

 I (32F) have a depressive disorder that induces anxious episodes. My husband (41M) has had situational GAD and PTSD in the past. I have wondered, for years now, if he's also had sustained and escalating adult ADHD. It's not my place to police his health and I feel guilty saying this. But, I am also struggling with intense behaviors on his end. I am \*not\* looking for a diagnosis; I need a safe space to release what I've been holding in. I think I'm aligned with the rules but of course Mods take down if not.  
 

 

 He completes several tasks, which is great. He has a client-facing, on-his-feet job that is a wonderful fit. However, he is extremely hyperactive; he fidgets, rapidly jerks up or into gestures, drops and knocks things over fairly regularly. Sleep is rough most of the time, with frequent ups and downs, tosses and turns on his end. He has accidentally jerked and hit me in the night (flailing arms or aggressively sitting up and flailing). He is so quickly bored that he won't watch programs for more than 10 minutes at a time. If we try to watch a film, he jerks or switches positions/gets up every few minutes. He gets really impatient about everything, and travel is a real challenge in he doesn't want to stay anywhere longer than 3 days. He gets irritated and angered by confinement in cars and planes. He is increasingly bored on date nights. He'll call out to something in the middle of myself or someone else talking.  
 

 

 My therapist, and a couple friends who are experiencing similar dynamics have mentioned a rise in adult ADHD across our country. I've been reading and learning about the many ways it can present (some articles from my therapist directly). When I vent, they validate that an evaluation might be a good idea. My therapist is a PhD, and not a psychiatrist.  
 

 

 The absolute rub: my husband sees neurodivergence as a flaw and a ""failure"". Even when some conditions can't be helped. Both of his parents have ADHD + a couple secondary disorders (my parents are narcs and Borderlines, so again no judgment), but the few times I've tried to gently discuss this, his walls go up. He swears he's ""not like them"" and ""just gets bored sometimes"". He says his own therapist (an LCSW) thinks he's just a nervous guy, which is hard to rebut when she doesn't live with us/takes his explanations and perspectives.  
 

 

 I'm so overstimulated by my husband. If I'm not cooking, cleaning, in exercise or running an errand, I am sedentary. I sit for hours or lay for hours (not that this is healthy, it's just my chemistry). I turn off lights and prefer the lowest ""fi"" environment. I don't like hurrying. I like to read and consume longer form, slower content. I have always taken long, immersive trips abroad.  
 

 

 Most days I try to ignore it and enjoy when I do have productive attention with him. I always remember that my depressive-anxious issues aren't fun to live with, either. Nonetheless, I've cried in the bathroom on the bad days, so overwhelmed by the hyperactivity. We usually have about an hour in the evening where we enjoy dinner and conversation...but he exhibits the hyperactivity as soon as dinner ends. Weekends are getting harder, as alcohol and social gatherings keep him at a highly stimulated/hyper level, and sleep is worsening for us both. Increasingly, I look forward to him going to work, I tiptoe and try not to wake him when he naps, I time my activity to not engage/trigger him to spring up...just so I can have a second of calm. This autumn, one of my worst depressive-anxious flareups came after an intense few days with him at home.  
 

 

 It wasn't always like this (been together 10+ years). However, the hyperactivity matter has come up twice in the last 4 years...both instances led to fights. Even with my best efforts to be loving and respectful in bringing it up, it triggers him. I hate hurting him with this. I try to savor the beginnings of dates and joyful moments, yet I worry that slower experiences are going to be off the table (like a long vacation). Even in older age, his parents are always restless and incredibly booked/busy...they often drop/spill things, and have even sustained injuries from multitasking mishaps. And I believe they are both medicated. This worries me for them and our own future. Our good times are still good...They're just getting shorter and shorter, replaced with chaotic mannerisms.  
 

 

 I don't think I can get support on this. His friend group is high-octane and lives for sensational stimuli, large group events as often as possible, and would likely take his word over mine. I don't want anyone to feel judged, nor do I want to embarrass my husband. My in-laws love me, but my husband still carries trauma and resentment from their past as a family. Not sure he'd listen to them on anything, even if they stepped in discretely. They and a grandparent were abusive throughout his childhood, and thus have little to no credit in my husband's eyes (though they have repaired enough for cordiality).  
 

 

 I don't think I'm a better person because I sit/lay and live at a slower behavioral pace. I really, really don't! I own my issues and limitations. My husband and I have built a wonderful life, I married him with joy, intention, and clarity. I just feel these trends intensifying and it's smothering me. My nerves are shot. And yet, when I inevitably have to bring it up, he will feel disrespected. 99% likely to shut down and bounce off the walls even more. My friend's husband got diagnosed and medicated recently, and I'm envious of their progress. She says he seems happier and less tense, and I'd love to get there. Or at least open my husband up to an evaluation.  
 

 

 Sorry for the long read, just have to release. If you have any similar experiences, certainly here to commiserate."
"I have an anxiety disorder. I'm on medication but it doesn't seem to be working. I go to the ER probably once a month for this. They give me ativan and send me on my way. I'm struggling so much I've thought of suicide. I don't have a plan I'm just tired of suffering. I can't eat, I'm having nightmares, and I'm self medicating. Nothing is working. I can't distract myself because my body freezes up. My only relief is sleep and it takes about five minutes upon waking for my anxiety to kick. I can't enjoy anything. I need a therapist but I can't find one that takes my insurance and there are several months wait to see them. What am I supposed to do in the meantime? The anxiety really kicked up when my father committed suicide. He was my rock and he kept me calm. I don't know how I'm going to make it. Please help me somehow. I have a cold now and I've lost weight from this and I'm afraid of what this is doing to my body. Every second of every day is agony. Doctors are labeling me a drug seeker because medication doesn't work on my body. I think it's a gaba receptor issue, which is what the anesthesiologist who did my colonoscopy said. I can't get through the day. I can't enjoy anything. When it gets really bad all I can do is cry. It's putting a strain on my marriage and my other relationships. Whether I'm at home or out it's the same feeling. I would do anything to make this stop, but there's nothing. Anything, any suggestion would be welcome. I just need help. Right now I have no phone and no car and I don't want to go to the hospital by ambulance because there's a chance they wouldn't help me and I'd be stuck there. Inpatient is not an option because I've done that a few times and it only made it worse. Offing myself would be much easier but I don't want to put my loved ones through that, especially after what happened to my dad. I ran out of my medicine early because it takes more to have an effect. My dad was the same way so I think it's hereditary. I'm so sick. Please help me and don't judge me"
"Hello all. I dont know if i have a severe anxiety or panic attack issue. My anxiety “attacks” started 2 months. Maybe due to overwhelming work and not enough rest. Not sure. But it first happened in the mall (when i just recovered from covid). So after that, i was quite scared to go to the mall or any place with a lot of people around. I have improved since then by taking enough rest and some natural supplements (and herbs). However, now when i force myself to go to the mall, i am fine most of the time, except when i am at the cashier or when i am about to finish my shopping. Its really weird. And i dont know why this happens. 
 

 I do keep thinking that i will feel uneasy when i am at the cashier. How do i get rid of these feelings? Any suggestions will be helpful"
"Hi all,
 

 This is my first post ever. And I have been feeling somewhat of an existential crisis lately. I have suffered from dibilitating anxiety since 2012 and ten years later I have gone through so many jobs that I can't keep or continue due to my illness. Sometimes I will have moments where everything is okay and manageable and other times I'm am just spiraling and feel like my anxiety has anxiety about anxiety. If you know what I mean. i feel like a loser. I used to have a sucessfull career anf was going places in life and now i have nothing. This makes life so challenging because when I am good, I am this super go-getter that can take on the world and then when anxiety is bad I can't even leave the house. Today I am once again without a job due to anxiety and I feel like I am running out of ideas or options. I feel like a loser because i live at home still and have never been able to move out. I know its a blessing to have a home and family but I am 30 years old and this was not how i imagined my life. I have tried the disability route but I don't have 4 years to wait for denial on top of denial. Any tips on what to do? I just wish I could find even a basic office job at this point but have not had any luck since that was not my career. Any tips?"
"I'm diagnosed with GAD and will be starting medication soon but the last few weeks I have been less and less motivated to do anything remotely productive. 
 

 I was getting into running and cooking regularly in September and October. But now I don't want to do anything. I can't even bring myself to go to the pharmacy to get this prescription filled. I don't want to exercise, cook, clean, work, go grocery shopping, etc. Even small things like showering and brushing my teeth I don't want to do, but can at least usually force myself to. Often I don't want to do anything. Except I guess waste time on my phone. I just wait for the few times a week where my brain shifts enough to a mood where I want to do some of those things. But it seems like it's getting worse and the shift is happening less and less frequently.
 

 There is a general feeling of pointlessness to a lot of things. And I feel fairly hopeless overall.
 

 Are these common symptoms that come with anxiety or does this sound more like mild depression? Or something else?
 

 I have talked to my doctor recently but I didn't mention so much this lack of motivation. It seemed the anxiety side was alot more obvious and we both focused on that but now I'm just wondering."
"Hi it’s currently 5am and I am just in full blown panic. I have had health and heart anxiety for over a year now. I am trying not convince myself not to go to the ER. Last EKG and blood work I had for my heart was in January and it was normal, but I keep having weird sensations in my chest like it’s a twitch and on my left side of my chest near my rib cage. It’s freaking me out. I’m a respiratory therapist so I listened to my heart and it sounds totally fine.. I just wish I could have a hug"
"I'm currently experiencing anexiety and stress caused by my job. When I'm not working, my stress is almost zero. I give you a few point to let you kindly tell me what would you do if you were me? Would you not give up and keep working on managing stress until x number of months/years or you would change your job immediately?
 

 I really appreciate any advice you can give me!
 

 0- I'm 32. No kids/pets. Not married. In relationship.
 1- It started a bit more than year, about 6 months after I changed my consultant role and became a project manager. It gradually felt more and more stressful to a point where I could not literally keep working. I started to take medicine to be able to work. Took 5mg SSRI first, it worked well for a while, then stress came back. Switched to 10, after a while to 20mg. Now, I feel like the 20mg is starting to lose it's calming power again :(
 

 2-My stress was significantly less when I was a consultant. I never even felt I have anexiety or stress issue in my previous role.
 

 3- I don't love my job. It's just a job. There are some parts that I like and some parts that I hate (boring). If it was not for money or potential future of it, I would not pick this Career. The fact that I need to constantly follow up and interact with issues and people is stressful to me.
 

 4- I feel the negative effects of stress and medicine in my body. I'm very worried about it. My memory declined and sometimes I get bad dreams.
 

 5- Apparently, I have ADD(ADHD).
 

 6-I don't want to give up on this career path unless I'm sure I have done everything I could but still I can't adapt to the stress of job in long term. So far, I have had 12 psychology sessions. It definitely helped but still I get stressed (bit less).
 

 7- I keep doing the CBT therapy based on psychology sessions.
 

 8- I don't want to stay on medication due to it's side effects. I don't want to be in this job with medication long term. That's a big NO to me.
 

 9- Sometimes I ask myself is big money worth doing something that is stressful by nature (among most stressful jobs) and I don't like much.
 

 10- I'm very good at my job and find doing it easy. My previous job was much harder and payed less.
 

 11- Sometimes I feel like with stress my body tries to tell me this job is not a right fit for me.
 

 12- If I want to change career, it would mean a lot of time and experience I invested in this career will be wasted and I would need to forget about big bucks at least for a few years.
 

 13- since it's important, I mention it again. I feel like I will be a loser if I give up. But my body and the message is sending me and my health make me doubtful how far I should keep going."
"I've had pretty bad hypochondria for nearly a decade. It tends to come in cycles, I have a low-level background amount and then ever so often (typically once a year or so) I have a massive flare up.
 

 Right now, I'm in a pretty bad flare up. My current fear is dementia, particularly a couple of different kinds that start with visual troubles or hallucinations. Because of that anytime I see something remotely out of the ordinary and someone else isn't around to see it I have a panic attack. For instance, I the light on my switch controller randomly comes on despite the machine being asleep and I panic because it's always when I'm by myself. 
 

 Tonight, I was driving and had a panic attack because I randomly saw fireworks just ahead of me despite it being like 8pm in November and my state only allowing sales in June, July, and December. 
 

 In my anxiety I asked a couple of people on foot if they saw them, one girl said she heard it then saw the colors, another dude said he heard but didn't see it, and finally someone else a few streets over told me I was high and to go home. 
 

 Now I'm spiraling worried that I'm hallucinating things and it's an impending dementia (like Lewy Body Dementia) and I'm going to slowly deteriorate and leave my family with a dysfunctional mess to handle. I worry about not being there for my kids. 
 

 I started Lexapro again, 5mg, but it just seems to make me sleepy and a bit placid. 
 

 Honestly, I just needed to vent with people who get it. My family is pretty callous about this kind of stuff and I think tired of dealing with me. I'm really frustrated because this comes on the heels of having like 8 straight really good weeks.
 

 Anyone else deal with this particular fear?"
"Hello everyone. First off I just want to say how great it is to see a community this large and supportive. For someone like myself who all of a sudden found themselves experiencing all this, it's been amazing to have so many resources on hand. 
 

 I'm 31 and male. I was in the military but it's been almost ten years. I have a job that doesn't pay me great, but I really enjoy it and my coworkers. I rent and can afford it without much drama. I have an amazing girlfriend of five years working her way through vet school and she's killing it. My life for all intents and purposes is very, very enjoyable. 
 

 I have issues. Secrets. Things we all do. Like a lot of us I pushed down a lot of the things I didn't want to really deal with and just pretended like it would be fine. Debt. Teeth. 
 

 It's not worth it in my case, but I will not speak for any of you because all of our situations are different. I only have 4.5k in debt. That sucks, but so so many people have so much worse. Yeah, the teeth bit kinda sucks but they aren't scary or rotten and I'm hoping on marrying a vet. 
 

 I guess the point of this rambling other than to help with the black hole in my gut is to just say that this stuff can sneak up and body slam you. You can tell yourself you're fine or it's fine or it'll be fine, but I strongly urge anyone who has the means to take action to do it. I plan on offering my collectors what I can afford and moving on from there. I'll pay it down when I can, but it sure beats the hell out of just tossing the bill in the trash and moving on. 
 

 It's been about two weeks. I spoke with a psychiatrist and got basically some pumped up allergy medicine for when I start really spinning. I'm hoping taking these steps can start to help me out. 
 

 It's rough, and to all of you who have been dealing with this for weeks,months or even years....know that I'm pulling for you"
So the past few days (longer actually) I’ve been incredibly sick with anxiety. I’m having trouble eating and sleeping and my stomach is a mess. I got my xanax today and I’m still feeling terrible. Does it take more than one day for me to feel stable again?
"I’m 30 years okd (in a few days), a mother to a 4 month old (after 8 years of trying to conceive) and I have suffered with anxiety for around 12 years. 
 

 I tried meds two types of meds when I was 19 but I didn’t like them. I can’t remember why. I did therapy when I was 19, 27 and 29. I just end up feeling empathetic towards it and disinterested. 
 

 I had a hard birth with my son (pre-eclampsia) and I was doing so well. For the last week or so though, I’ve struggled. I can’t control my emotions. 
 

 I don’t know if it’s time to medicate. I’m not the worst I’ve been by a mile, but I’m sad. 
 

 When did you know it was time?"
Anyone else here on Effexor? I’m on 150 now but my doctor wants me up to 225. I have a feeling it’s making things worse but that could be the anxiety speaking. Would I be okay upping my dose or will it make things worse for a while?
"As the title says , i (33M)have been having issues with my heart racing out of the blue , been to two cardiologist all good.
 

 Getting some regular pain in the limbs and having objects move (i see them by the corner of my eye)
 

 I don't know how to go about it as i have a high demanding job a baby to help take care of and stopped going to the gym since the baby is more and more demanding of me than his mother who works on her PhD full time.
 

 The depression keeps sinking me deeper and i get anxious while driving , while working while at home.
 

 The spacing out is more frequent and it's bothering.
 

 I really don't know what do right now if i should get some professional help or do more meditation?
 

 Anyone been in my shoes ?"
"My doctor prescribed me Xanax and for the first time I feel like a normal human being. I can play my sims and watch tv like a normal person and not have the constant sick feeling of anxiety. Today has been the first time in months I’ve actually felt like I used to without this horrible illness making me feel paralyzed. The only complaint I have is being more clumsy and a little sleepier than usual. This is embarrassing but lately I’ve been only shower once a week because the idea of sorting, washing clothes, drying them and showering has terrified me. That’s actually embarrassing on a deep level. Well today things are different and I started a load today without any paralyzing, sick feeling of anxiety. I’m going to get nice and clean! I love you guys and I hope you can find a way to push through this terrible illness. I know medication isn’t the only answer but therapists are hard to come by in my area. Any suggestions on that?"
"As a 31M I don’t have much experience with dating or relationships since I am really shy in person. I want to date however I feel like my shyness and perceiving myself as a boring person with be a fan of video games, sports and and so on would be hinderance however I have started going to the gym again , wanting to get in to hiking more on our local trails and I am also working on finally getting my drivers license 
 

 I am a kind,loyal, compassionate, honest person and have been told that I need to be better at being relaxed since I have been told that I mostly seem too serious especially with my job as a roofer, even though it would probably never
 happen I have always had the mindset that if I am not always doing my best I could be laid off 
 

 I do have regrets about not starting to work on improving myself or towards a relationship sooner Despite that I still want to take my time getting in to everything"
"Hello everyone. Hope you guys are doing well. Having read through many posts on this reddit, i hope everyone gets past their issues. I was never really having any sort of panic attack all my life. But last 6 months i have started feeling it. It happened after i got sick (covid). And i was overworked this entire year. I think i was fatigued. I suddenly developed all sorts of anxiety and panic like symptoms. I was scared to go in public places as my heart was easily excited (adrenaline rush). It became so bad that even if someone got up suddenly from his chair near me, my heart was excited. I was very worried and started wondering if i have some mental health issues. This overthinking made it worse and i found myself thinking a lot even during sleep. 
 

 

 I started taking some herbs and supplements (after watching tons of andrew huberman YT channel). It helped with sleep. I felt better. But. There is something that worked better than anything i have ever imagined - diaphragmatic breathing. I read alot about it and how we constantly breathe wrong (most of us) almost all our lives. It worked from my first 5 minute session itself. I have been doing this for the past 2 weeks only. Multiple times a day. And i dont get into panic or anxiety mode at all. I know it sounds strange or exaggerated but this is what i feel. Maybe it is placebo or my condition was not severe, but it really worked for me. 
 I hope you guys also give this ago and feel better."
"30F and I’ve had anxiety and intermittent depression for over 10 years. I finally decided to medicate following a diagnosis of postpartum depression. I’m taking 10mg of paroxetine each morning. 
 

 I’ve noticed the past two days that I have a few hour bout of diarrhoea from around 45 minutes after taking it in the morning, until around 3 hours after. I’m guessing this will stop as my body gets used to it? 
 

 What should I expect over the coming weeks? When should I expect to start feeling a bit better? Any other side effects I should expect over the next couple of weeks as I get used to it or for the whole time I’m taking the drug? 
 

 Thanks!"
"34M here. I've been working on my anxiety for about eight years, and I have resisted taking a medication for all that time. I've been treating my anxiety with lots of exercise (I changed jobs and get 100k+ steps a week, plus I swim and lift at the gym after work), talk therapy, meditation, and daily Cannabis use (ymmv).
 

 But I also have Seasonal Affective Disorder and it's dark as sin in Minnesota right now, my partner is sick with some undiagnosed long term illness that they've been dealing with since June. Since he hasn't been working, we're short on funds, so I've been working overtime, which also isn't great for me.
 

 So, I'm stressed and anxious.
 

 I finally talked to my doctor about a script. Took my first 10 MG tablet of citalopram a couple of hours ago. I'm feeling hyper aware and jumpy, but a little relieved that I'm doing everything that I can."
"Melatonin and Benadryl couldn't get it done. Does anyone have any tips? It's been two days since I slept and it sucks.
 

 Edit: I just wanna take a second to thank each and every single one of you. It's amazing seeing so many of you ready to offer advice and encouragement. God I'm glad I found this sub.
 

 Edit 2: So picked us some valerian tea and magnesium supplements. I also have melatonin supplements. Thank you again everyone. The weighted blanket is just a little too pricey for me right now, though. Also I'm gonna keep my place a little colder at night. Again, thank you all so much."
"Some people don't understand how it is to be in a place where we can't maintain a job due to anxiety but really wanting to work. 
 I have left about 3 jobs due to my mental health. 
 The challenge I am finding right now is potential employers asking why I have not had consistent work history. Struggling trying to find what to say. My past experience has been as long as 1 year or as short as 6 months. I understand I have had my challenges but I am honestly working through it and each time I feel I am much better and gain new awareness of how to manage it. So its also like part of the process. But still struggling. Makes me super anxious that I may become unhirable. But I really want to work plus I tried the disability thing and that is just depressing and full of rejection."
"I'm; 30M and have only lived outside of my house for about a year. Now I'm back. It really REALLY suck, It;s to the point when I try to use my grandparents 1970s kitchen to make a meal that I fell like I'm not welcomed. It's like a I always make a simple mistake that pisses off my grandmother to an irrational level of hate. To be clear, both my grandparents have sacrificed soo much for me and my brother whom they both took us in, And I'm grateful beyond what words can describe, But the personality differences is a huge conundrum from me as i do believe in respect, but not agreeing with every standpoint someone you respect agrees with. This causes me to question every position I've ever stood on. It is so anxiety inducing that it makes me break downs trying to appease a person what has undoubtedly changed my life for the better, yet refuses to engage in honest conversation about certain topics, I want to expand my mind but my emotions always seem to get away and skew the discussion of course. I don't know if there's an answer. but hopefully fo cause my reality is on the brink of insanity, a constuct I know too wel, 
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Sorry for the vent., It just affects my psyche much more than I'd like to admit."
"I feel like I just can't shake the feeling that something has gone terribly wrong, it's almost like I'm afraid to try to accomplish anything because it's too late..
 I feel like maybe I've already died and I'm just a ghost living a dream.
 Then there's always these compulsive thoughts that I'm going to die in some stupid idiotic way.
 

 I'm 32 years old living with my dad because I left my job a year ago due to anxiety and panic attacks.
 Now I'm on Zoloft only 25 mg, but it stopped my panic attacks.
 

 But every day I still have lots of anxiousness and derealization..
 At least enough to stop me from being able to accomplish anything as my life passes by"
"So this is going to sound a little addiction-esque. However I don't believe that's the case, correct me if I'm wrong. 
 

 For years, I have cycled through every off label anxiety medication. All of them. Ssris, beta blockers, gabapentin, blood pressure meds, vistiril, SNRIs. Every one that I'm aware of. And never got any relief. 
 

 I continued to respectfully tell my psychiatrist that nothing was working, but I have addictive tendencies, so he was extremely hesitant to prescribe a med in the benzo class. 
 

 Until one day I couldn't take it anymore. I called him up in tears, hyperventilating, explaining that NOTHING WAS WORKING. NOTHING we had tried over the past few years had ANY effect. 
 

 So he finally decided to trust me. I had been sober for 60 something days, and I had no intention of breaking that.
 

 I picked up a 90 day supply, the only supply I'll get, and on the bottle ot said to take 0.5 to 1mg for severe anxiety 3 times daily as needed. I started low, and I couldn't believe it. I could function again. I could go to the grocery store. I could leave the house.
 

 I didn't think that my life was over anymore.
 

 For a while, I was taking 0.5mg, once a day, every day. Because I genuinely needed it. To back that claim up, closely following my perscription, I spent 18 days in the psychiatric hospital. 
 

 After I got out, I've been going longer and longer without it. The coping skills are starting to fucking WORK. 
 

 What I love about the 0.5mg dose, personally, is that it allows me to still FEEL anxious. However it brings it down from a place where it's unmanageable entirely, to where coping skills are effective. It's giving me time to practice. 
 

 I genuinely can't wait until I no longer have to take it anymore. And I feel like that day is coming soon. I'm working my ASS off in therapy. 
 

 And it's WORKING."
"How can you tell the difference? I feel like I have symptoms of all of them but my doctor seems to focus on me having general anxiety. Which I'm sure I do to an extent but the feelings of fear and worry feel a lot different than they did when I was first diagnosed almost 20 years ago. As in it's not just the feeling of worrying all the time effecting me at all.
 

 I very often have no motivation to do anything. I even want to avoid small things like cooking, cleaning, watering my plants, paying bills. I spend most of my days when not working just on my phone watching YouTube videos or on Reddit. I even spend most of my time at work doing the same thing since I work from home. Not because I really want to be doing that, but it's the easiest thing to do. It feels like my natural state.
 

 For stuff like cleaning and cooking it feels just like laziness. Like it's just easier to not do these things or I can push them off to do another day. There's no fear or anxiety in doing them. I just don't enjoy it. It's like my brain can barely handle doing anything that doesn't give it some little bit of pleasure.
 

 Attempting to focus on anything else that I want to be able to focus on, like planning a vacation, moving to a new city, and looking at other jobs, become overwhelming and frustrating very quickly. I feel like by brain isn't able to stay relaxed and focused for long enough for tasks like this. This very well could be due to anxiety since I do think I'm pretty afraid of making mistakes and making wrong decisions. And of struggling or being unable to figure something else. I guess just a strong fear of failure. Even small failures. 
 

 That's it I think. I've seen therapists and they haven't provided that much useful clarity. I'm talking to a new one over the phone Thursday so will hopefully remember to bring this up. Then will start seeing one regularly in January once my benefits renew."
"My brother’s husband (M30) is a super nice guy as is my brother(M30). When he and my brother leave we all say “I love you”
 

 I (M33) one time said “It was good seeing you” instead of “I love you” even after he said “Love you” I said it because as much as I like his company and think he’s a great guy and genuinely care about him I don’t have as deep a connection to him as I do my brother and my parents and, at the time, wasn’t sure if I did love him the way I love my parents and my brother. To be honest I’m still not sure.
 

 Now he’ll say “I love you” to everyone else but “It was good to see you” to me. I want us to be able to say “love you” to each other like everyone else in the family but only if it’s true. And I’m genuinely not sure.
 

 He’s been a part of our family for probably nearly 10 years now.
 

 I still don’t know if there is love there and I’m not sure if there should be or if it’s something I should strive for or if being glad to see each other is enough.
 

 My parents are “Mom and Dad” to him and he’s become a third son and I’m genuinely happy about that but for some reason it bothers me that he’s never fully become like a 2nd brother to me."
"I'll keep this post as short as I can, but I've got a lot on my mind. I'm 31 years old. Through most of my 20's, I watched porn and masturbated 2-3 times a day, every single day. That was back when I lived with my parents.
 

 I moved out at 28, and have been on my own since. I also struggled with a weed addiction during that time, which fueled my porn addiction. I've been making big strides to clean up my life after moving out, and while I'm proud of my progress, I still battle my demons. 
 

 I now lift weights 4-5 times a week, eat clean and healthy and have installed better habits into my life overall. I'm studying software development and I'm very optimistic about my future. With that being said, I'm not completely free from my old struggle. I now masturbate and watch porn twice a month, and smoke once a month. It's been that way almost 4 years now. 
 

 While I see this as massive improvement, it's hard for me to feel good about it. Every time I go past two weeks, I get extremely anxious and irritated. I guess I just want some outside perspective on my situation. 
 

 I read that most people masturbate 1-2 times a week, so it's hard for me to know what's normal. I feel like I should never be watching porn or masturbating ever, under any circumstances, but this just feels absolutely impossible. I feel like I should be perfect with this.. but in this culture, who can be?
 

 I can't tell if my dissatisfaction is coming from the fact that porn and masturbation are still a part of my life (albeit, a very small part), or if it's because I expect perfection, and I'm simply not able to do it. I can't tell, is something wrong with me, or am I doing okay?"

"Hi, i dont speak english well so don't chew me. 
 I'm 32 male and ive always suffered from noticing who is watching and also afraid i look stupid or embarrassing. When i do something ouside my comfort zone i feel strange and dirty. I also have issues when i walk I'm afraid to look feminine so i get extremely self conscious and try to notice who's watching or laughing, i dont know why i care logically it's dumb but i get those anxious feeling and panic.
 I'm really fed ip because I'm inhibited and i can't just act normal I'm extremely self conscious can someone maybe know what is causing this?"
"Hey ya'll,
 

 I hope you are all doing well and not currently dealing with any sort of anxiety/stress in your lives.
 

 I'm (31M) in the process of some introspection and would love to hear your thoughts/opinions on what you think about my mishaps, and if there's anything relatable to you. I guess I just feel so fucking alone with these thoughts that everybody I've spoken with, whether that's a partner, date or friend just doesn't seem to understand.
 

 So, I've been doing therapy for the past year so with a focus on my confidence, upbringing, ADHD and love life(to some extent). And It's been amazing. I feel It has helped shape me in a way where I am more resilent to everyday struggles. Additionally, it has made me understand the importance of keeping a journal so I can later recount a moment of stress/anxiety and look differently etc.
 

 However, when it comes to dating somebody I still have these issues where I am having a hard time figuring out the cause. After reading a few posts on this subreddit it has reassured and made me feel that maybe this is all anxiety related.
 

 So to give some examples of what I deal with every time I start dating somebody:
 

 1. We match/meet, exchange numbers etc and go on a date. 9 times out of 10 it usually always goes pretty well.
 

 However, my thought process during this encouter is ""god, please don't tell me that you're living with your ex still, that you have personally cheated in the past or give me reason to suspect that you're lying."" If any of these ring true then I usually just leave it as that and think of it as these being boundaries for me that I just can't accept.
 

 2. We start texting and communicating
 

 Usually at this stage I'm wondering if they're still open to dating others whilst we are seeing each other. Of course nothing is official and they're within their own right to see others during this period. And if they're open and transparent with me then it is usually ok. It's the **not knowing** if that's happening that becomes a problem.
 

 And I hate having to bring this up because the amount of shame/embarassment I feel after is unreal. It terrifies me that I am coming off clingy/needy etc. Usually when I do eventually ask out of the overthinking, it is normally a reassuring ""No, I can only get to know somebody one at a time,"" or just simply ""no.""
 

 The most recent date which has actually just ended due to these thoughts and fears went something like this:
 

 The usual points above 1 and 2 took place, the only difference this time was we slept together on the first date and became pretty intimiate(at least that was my interpretation ). Then she went away on holiday for 10 days on a surfing trip with a few randoms she met through IG. Obviously I was over the moon with this and a little jealous as I would love to step away from my job atm and surf.
 

 However, when she told me that she was going away for 10 days or so, all I could think about was ""is she sleeping in the same room as guys,"" ""what if she finds one of these guys more fun/attractive than me?"" ""what if she sleeps with somebody -- *which again, she's within her own right to do so of course, given that we're not together --* and doesn't tell me?"" 
 

 *I know I should just trust, but I just fucking can't. I can't seem to tell myself that ""she won't do that because she doesn't seem that way. I usually just end up telling myself that, I don't have control over this and that's ok. And if they were to do this then It's not for me. But it's still so so hard to calm myself.*
 

 This caused me to overthink massively, and following my therapists advice, I opened up and told her how I was feeling. At this point we had only seen each other twice which sounds fucking crazy I know. But I guess given how intimiate things felt, I felt comfortable telling her my concerns.
 

 Eventually, these thoughts kept occuring which led to her saying ""you've opened up a lot and keep bringing up these fears etc, I want to see the positive side to you etc."" And I totally fucking get it. It would be difficult to deal with this. I just hate it that I can't seem to shake these thoughts and then eventually say something or come across like there's something wrong, because I don't have the best poker face.
 

 Every single person I have dated has experienced this side to me, and it usually ends with me ending things because I just can't deal with the thoughts or in this case, I scare them off. I'm aware that I think little of myself, I just really want there to be a way so I can overcome this because I've ruined some pretty decent relationships with some incredble people, and I honestly feel hopeless.
 

 I have hobbies and try to keep myself distracted and to not put a shit ton of focus on them, but with certain things(like the holiday example) it becomes so crippling that I just can't seem to shake the fear.
 

 Thanks for taking the time to read, I really appreciate it and would love to hear your thoughts on what you think the issues are. Bonus points if you're able to help. I'm seeing another therapist tonight whose focus is on CBT."
"Been on it for a bit and it didn’t seem to do much when I take it during the day. I took it once before bed and woke up an hour later to a pounding heart but decided to blame it on a new ADHD med (I’m now off) that was making me have disrupted sleep. Was told to start taking 2 before bed if I can’t sleep due to racing thoughts so I did that last night and fell asleep pretty fast, but was up an hour later from my heart beating so fast and hard I questioned if I should be medically concerned."
"Anyone else have this? I noticed my pupils dialate and constrict while I was looking in the mirror I of course googled and it says it's a sign of aortic regurgitation which is something I have been worried about lately!
 

 &amp;#x200B;
 

 Ughhhh
 

 anyone else have these when they look in the mirror?"
"Hello good people. I'm in the throes of new anxiety which stems from my heart anxiety. But almost this entire year I've had pulstations in my neck, feet and abdomen and I'm scared it's cause of my heart valves. 
 Yesterday I got Covid for the second time and started reading more about heart crap cause I started noticing these pulsations after having had Covid back in February. I was staring at my eyes in the mirror and I could see the pupils dilate and constrict and I had just read that pulsating pupils like that are a sign of a leaky heart valve!! So I'm now in a panic! But there is a chance it's just my eye reacting to seeing constantly new things and changes in light while looking at the mirror.  
 So I'm asking for a favour, if there is a kind person on here willing to check their eyes in the mirror and see if their pupils keep dilating and constricting while watching but I also see it if I look in my phone camera.  
 Anyone willing to do this?"
"So i've struggled with Anxiety on and off for most of my adult life (i'm 34 now), but for some reason when there are issues with my computer, or in some cases things I perceive to be ""issues"" with my computer, I really have a hard time focusing on anything else, especially when something i've found is not really ""fixable"", if that makes sense. There will be certain irregularities regarding things on my laptop that, while not causing my computer to break or malfunction, are still enough to not allow me to just ignore the issue. It's like they are in this real annoying grey area, and part of me would prefer that my laptop would just Blue-screen or my hard drive would fail (I back everything up on an external HD regularly) so I can go from being anxious and worried to irritated that I have to buy a new PC but at least relieved.
 

 The latest computer issue had to do with my Antivirus showing an issue with my computer on a Network inspector scan, saying it was ""accessible"" from the internet, but only doing so intermittently, going back and forth between good scan results and bad scan results with no consistency. After doing a ton of tests and talking to an IRL friend of mind who is good with computers, I narrowed it down to basically the IPv6 settings on my router, and was told that there isn't anything to worry about on various reddit tech threads so long as my Windows Firewall is still on and I haven't messed around with any settings.
 

 Well, then I got way too paranoid and started looking at my Windows Firewall rules, analyzing everything several times a day, sometimes even an hour. I accidentally reset my firewall rules one time, but since then I have purposely reset my Windows firewall rules back to their defaults, doing so three times yesterday, including once at 2 am. Why? Because I'll look at the settings and the rules to see what they are, and even though i'm not changing anything - only looking at stuff, the most i'll do is look at the properties, but not making any changes and hitting *cancel* instead of *OK* to not even accidentally change anything. Even with this, there will be something I notice that I think ""wait, was that always like that or did I inadvertently do something"", and so i'll reset the firewall settings again to see, in both instances that it indeed was meant to be like that. But I still kept resetting them, which has required uninstalling and re-installing several apps and programs as a result so that a necessary firewall exception is created and they can work properly. All because I'm afraid that simply scrolling through the features and looking at the ""Allowed Apps through Windows Firewall"" and the Advance settings leads to the possibility that I might accidentally change something, even though I know that I haven't.
 

 So yeah, that's where i'm at with my anxiety right now. I know it's a really, really dumb thing to worry about, and like I've said when I have a potential computer issue I tend to get really anxious to begin with. This feels worse and more worrisome I think because the nature of the issue is a *potential* security vulnerability issue. (Heavy emphasis on ""potential"" there). So far I haven't reset my firewall defaults today and i'm hoping that last night is the last time at least for a long time, and if I do it again or obsess over anything related to it it's for an actual functional reason, not because I'm super paranoid."
"I'm 31 and I've had 2 mild panic attacks in the past.. I'd rate then both about a 3.5/10.
 

 A few days ago I had my first full blown 10/10 and had an ambulance called. It wasn't a build up, it went from zero to 100 within 2 seconds, and lasted for 2 minutes and it was almost every symptom of a heart attack.
 

 Since that day I've managed to fight off at least 2 panic attacks each day. I can feel them coming on and manage to calm myself down before it gets out of hand by recognising they're not dangerous.
 

 For those of you who experienced this, did you end up getting smaller waves of panic attacks after your first big one? how long did it last?"
"Do you have like a day when ""all of this started""?
 

 I'm trying to make sense out of what I'm going through so maybe hearing stories from other people can help.
 

 I personally have a very specific day where it all started and never tuly went away but there were some signs starting from elementary school but those moments were totally bearable and it they never had truly anything to do with a real disorder. A lot of times I was just overthinking sensations of sleepiness or some very mild light headedness, which can happen to everyone, not only to anxious people."
"I have health anxiety mainly surrounding my heart and fear of a heart attack. I'm 33F and for the past 3 months have been dealing with daily dizzy/near fainting spells and weird sensations in my chest. I've gone to urgent care and my doctor who both ran some tests (including an EKG and a 24 hr heart monitor) and said everything looks good. They said it is just anxiety and put me on zoloft. My physical symptoms have not improved yet.  
 

 I currently wear a samsung galaxy watch and when I'm feeling dizzy or weird I check my heart rate. My heart rate is usually good and it brings me comfort that things are probably ok. My watch could use an upgrade and I saw that the next model includes an ekg type feature. Do you think this could be helpful in keeping me calm when I'm feeling anxiety about my health or it could be hurtful if it feeds into my heart health fears? Advice?"
Has anyone ever had pain in their left arm that goes away and comes back? I've had this for two months now. I also feel pressure in my throat. I am 33 years old with good blood tests I do not understand
"How do you guys decide on books to help you with your anxiety?
 

 The problem I have is that I'll google ""anxiety help"" books or look at what is recommended on Reddit, but when I look at the reviews on Amazon or Goodreads there's always some reviews that basically say the book is worthless and that the psychology or philosophy used in the book is all drivel or something. Even if most reviews are positive, there seems to always be a few harshly critical ones that stand out. This makes me second guess getting the book and then I usually just move on to something else.
 

 How are we supposed to know who/what we can trust? Especially in a world where I do believe a large segment of ""self help"" authors are literally just writing what people with anxiety and depression want to hear so that the books get bought in the first place. I think there's just some inherent problems with the monetization of life advice and even therapy itself but that's another issue. 
 

 I'd really appreciate hearing some other perspectives on this. Thanks in advance."

"I feel like I need to be on anxiety medication, at least temporarily, but.. I'm having anxiety. My brother takes anxiety meds daily and he seems to not get excited or upset over anything. He's very robotic sadly, unless he drinks. I don't really want to be like that, but it could be who he is as a person. I wasn't around him much befire he was on them.
 

 I guess what I want to know is how was your life before v after anxiety medication? Did you get them right on the first try? I'm struggling pretty bad lately. 
 

 Thank you so much for reading. Have a great day ❤️"
"I (30F) have been driving since I was 17. I've always been a bit nervous about driving. My mom taught me to drive and she screamed a lot when I would make mistakes. I think that's were my driving anxiety initially began. I managed to get pretty comfortable with driving, though, up untill I had my first accident at age 20. It was on the highway and it was raining. To this day I feel really on edge driving on the highway in the rain. I had another accident in my mid twenties on my way to work. I rear ended someone, and now I have to keep a large amount of distance between me and the car in front of me.
 

  I drive almost every day, and some days are harder than others. The past several weeks have been particularly difficult. About a month ago I saw an accident on the highway, and it triggered memories of my first accident. Last week one of my coworkers had to call in because her and her son were in a four car pile up. Thankfully both of them made it out alive, but her son was injured. Since hearing this, I have felt extra on guard while driving. 
 

 Today I felt particularly anxious. I made it to work ok, but now I'm sitting in my car wondering how I made it. I hate knowing that I will have to continue driving to get to the places I need ro go. Public transportation sucks where I live. 
 

 I mainly just wanted to vent a little. Thank you for reading this if you made it all the way through. To all of you that have driving anxiety and get behind the wheel anyway, I empathize with you and respect you."
"For background I'm 34 and I've had anxiety for my whole life. It got really bad when I was 19 and worse when I was 28. When the pandemic hit a couple years ago it spiraled into the worst it's ever been. (All instances of it becoming worse were triggered by life events)
 

 I've been in therapy for two years. I started medication 3-4 months ago. The first medication didn't work out after about a week and it was changed to the one I'm on now. At first I felt like the medication was helpful: I joined a gym, I started sleeping a bit better. My anxiety was still there but I felt like I could push through it. 
 

 Perhaps it was a bit of a placebo effect or the medication just isn't for me, because now I feel just as bad as before. I have a hard time doing pretty much anything, and driving is a big trigger. The other day I drove to meet a friend and the whole entire time I was panicking, thinking I was going to pass out at the wheel, lose my vision, etc. I was trying to breathe while it was happening and calm down but I just couldn't calm down all day after that. 
 

 I'm at my wit's end. I'm not a su*cidal person, but I feel so helpless and hopeless and don't know what to do... I understand why people chose to go because I can't live like this anymore. I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do: therapy, medication, exercise, setting bed time hours, drinking plenty of water, meditation (attempting to anyway, I'm bad at it).
 

 I don't know what anyone can offer me or tell me, but I just want to cry and never leave my house again. I can't even work, it's so frustrating and demoralizing. I feel like a baby and a burden on everyone because I can't do anything for myself."
"Hi, it's my first post on here. I'm a long term anxiety patient and recently I've been noticing my heartbeat so much that I'm freaking out a little. I'm 33 year old male, with no history of any heart disease in the family, except for just regular things, mom with elevated cholesterol and some palps from time to time, nothing worrisome. 
 I went to see a doctor in a walk in clinic and he listened to my heart and everything sounded normal, my oxygen was at 98 and my BP was a bit high but nothing major, 160/84. Rythm was good too.  
 Has anyone here noticed their heartbeat a lot, like the belly is bouncing and see their chest rise a bit with each beat and in the neck too? 
 I've not felt much anxiety, as in the nervousness and that feeling of dread, it comes and goes but isn't constant like the heartbeat is. But I'm hoping this is still just anxiety. I worry a bit that maybe the doctor missed something when he was listening to my heart."
"I (31F) usually go to games with either my dad or brother. They both can't make opening day this year. None of my friends like baseball. I really want to go to the game so it would have to be by myself. I have never gone to a game solo before. I am so scared and keep flip flopping back and forth on whether I should go or not. I am worried people are going to be looking/judging me for being a girl alone at a baseball game or make jokes at me (I get really shy and embarrassed if any attention is called onto me) and I will feel like a loser. Not scared for my safety or anything, I am just anxious about the thought of being and looking alone."
"I was really nervous the whole time. I went at night so there weren't many people on the road. I had to keep on talking to myself, saying I could do it. I felt shaky but I got through it. It made me realise that I have a long way to go. But I'm ready to fight this."
"So I often get really focused on my breathing and often get shortness of breath or I get anxiety and my breathing gets out of whack and I start focusing on it then it keeps happening for longer. When it happens I get the urge to take a deep breath and not always getting it and sometimes get tingly in various spots. I saw a doctor this week and had my oxygen measured and I was at 98% so that's good so I'm getting enough oxygen regardless of that.  
  Does anyone else get this especially when overly focused on their breathing?"
"So I’ve struggled with anxiety since my mid 20’s (32F). I take celexa, have been in therapy over the years, meditate, exercise, do my best to keep that shit AT BAY.
 Now this week, I was hacked on my Instagram account by a bot, my account was wiped clean and a new account I can’t access was created using my photos promoting bitcoin bullshit.
 I know this is happening a lot now, but it totally took me by surprise, and let me tell you, the anxiety/panic just went off like a rocket. 
 Vomiting, sweating profusely, heart racing, chest tightness, nausea, dizziness. It was terrifying. 
 I’ve reported this scam all day for 2 days now and reset all my passwords on all platforms. But I feel because of my anxiety I just cannot let this thing go and accept that it’s out of my hands and I have to wait until account is taken down. 
 Has anyone else had such a slap in face almost constant anxiety attack that’s lasted a couple of days and shows no signs of letting up due to a life circumstance?
 Anyone with positive feedback or similar experiences? Also I can’t wait till this adrenaline crashes so a girl can sleep 🥲"
"Hey all, I've made 3 posts here already and I feel like people will probably get tired of me soon. But, for the last week or so I've been really worried about my heart valves. I went to a doctor on Sunday evening about me AAA fear and said it was no chance I have that. He then listened to my heart and heard nothing wrong there either and my HR was steady and o2 was at 98 but I still can't shake this worry that he might have missed something about my aortic valve. Cause I noticed the days after that I also have a bounding pulse in my neck where the carotids are and when I stare at myself for few seconds in the mirror I can see my head wobble with my pulse. Symptoms of aortic regurgitation!! 
 I went for a quick little jog this evening and according to Google Fit on my phone I jogged 1.15 km (0.7 miles) in 7 minutes at average speed of 6.3 km/h (3.9 mph) . I'm hoping that I wouldn't have been able to do that with an AR. 
 

 

 Anyone elses head wobble with their pulse like that?"
I couldnt sleep thinking what did i do ive never had a new car 6 year commitment scared the crap out of me i dont know why it caused me to have an anxiety attack
"so I was always suffering with anxiety but tried to manage it more or less
 

 recently I feel stressed out \_ my work was online for a long time and soon I will be going back ,also I have met guy who seems interesting but I am anxious that I am out of his league and I plan to move from my toxic family and start a new life and this thought living on my own scares me out .recently I go to bed very late so I always thought ,,damn if I go to bed this late my head will feel dizzy next day '' but still did not change my messy sleep schedule for a reason
 

 so today I was walking and I felt very dizzy and disoriented ,I got that feeling of slight derealization before but it was not very hard to manage ...today I felt the high level of derealization ,also I felt like I could not walk properly ,as if I would fall on the ground ,I felt out of balance so I walked very carefully and slowly ...I felt huge panic and anxiety ,stayed at a friend and on the way home I walked the same route and it was even worse : I felt like the environment and surroundings was very different and weird and I had the same weird fear of falling and stumbling and derealization..I was in full panic even though I was not walking alone .
 

 I had all the symptoms before but It was moderate today it felt like all the symptoms came together in scariest form and even though I read many self \_help books I felt huge panic ...even now when writing it I feel huge panic and fear ..bc I have finally decided to face my fears and start a new life and if anxiety hits so hard I will be stuck here forever.
 

 sadly my family is not supportive so I will try to hide my fear as much as I can ..and their lack of support is what makes my anxiety even worse .
 

 please give me advices ..or tell me that u u have been there and things will be better ! I desperately need it"

"Hello, anxiety friends! I wanted to post this because I know I've personally scoured this sub looking for posts about people's experiences on certain meds. Of course, I don't recommend doing this or consulting Google - you should ALWAYS talk to your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist etc. Every medication is different for everybody!
 

 I (30F) have had anxiety my entire life; I was clinically diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder as a freshman in college. Since then, I've been riding the anxiety rollercoaster; I've had periods of my life where it was very manageable, and periods when it's been pretty bad. My anxiety is usually health-centered and triggered by physiological changes. Symptoms of anxiety/panic attacks for me include dizziness, difficulty breathing/swallowing, feeling sweaty/clammy, depersonalization, heart racing, chest pain, numbness/tingling, stomach upset, etc. etc. Basically, your classic anxiety.
 

 I first went on medication when I was 19 and my psychiatrist put on my Lexapro. I stayed on it for about a year or two before tapering off, and stayed off for a couple of years. I went back on Lexapro at around 26 years old and again stayed on it for about 2 years before tapering off. Every time I was on medication, I was also in therapy (I think this is super important) and I got off/on meds in consultation with a psychiatrist or my general practitioner. 
 

 Recently my anxiety has gotten bad again, and this time my doctor put me on Prozac. I've been on it for a month now so I thought I'd detail the experience of both.
 

 Lexapro Cons: The process of getting on Lexapro was generally slower and for me, a bit rockier. I started on a very, very low dose and very gradually titrated up to a therapeutic dose; in all it probably took a few months to finally get up to the full dose (this is common practice and how it should be done). Both times that I started Lexapro, the first two weeks were rough. I had some of the worst panic attacks during that window (which could be coincidental). I didn't experience too many side effects - however, the biggest con for me with Lexapro is that I had a very intense increase in appetite, which led to weight gain each time. This was part of the reason my doctor decided to try Prozac for me.
 

 Lexapro Pros: Once I was fully up to a therapeutic dose of Lexapro, it did wonders for my anxiety and my mood. I was able to fully function and enjoy my life. I still experienced occasional anxiety (which, btw, the goal is never to fully eliminate anxiety - it's a normal human emotion), but rarely had panic attacks. My xanax prescription would usually expire while mostly full because I rarely had a need to take it.
 

 Prozac Cons: Honestly, there are very few negatives so far for me. The first week on it (and on an increased dose) I experienced a little bit of GI symptoms - mainly very mild diarrhea - and a little bit of disrupted sleep (waking up in the middle of the night for about an hour). Both of these side effects only lasted the first week. Unlike Lexapro, I did not experience any increase in appetite/weight gain with Prozac. Also, my anxiety didn't seem to get worse before it got better. 
 

 Prozac Pros: Pretty much everything lol. I felt like I was seeing genuine improvement within the first 10 days, which of course could be a placebo effect, but absolutely by \~3 weeks in I was vastly improved. I went from having panic attacks almost daily, to about 2/week, then 1/week, then none. I was on 20mg for the first month, and because my general level of anxiety was still pretty high, increased to 40mg. Again, the impact was felt very quickly - and noticed by people around me (including people who don't know I'm on medication). 
 

 **tl;dr** When I was on Lexapro, I assumed I was experiencing typical side effects (and maybe I was) and that the ends justified the means, because it treated my anxiety so well (true). I wish I hadn't been afraid of the trial and error that can come with trying different medications. It truly isn't one size fits all. I also always thought of medication as a temporary stop-gap, something I'd do for a year or two if my anxiety got bad and then get off. I'm now (finally) realizing that it might be a more permanent solution for me, and that's okay. Anxiety is a chronic illness for me and needs to be treated as such.
 

 Anyway, no matter where you are in your journey, just know that it can and does get better. I know medication can feel very scary, but it can (and is) absolutely life-saving - whichever one works better for you. Please also don't interpret this as Lexapro=bad and Prozac=good. I really can't stress enough how every medication is different for each individual person."

"I am long time sufferer and I have already had many symptoms
 

 But very recent symptom which freaks me out the most is that : When I go out and feel anxious I feel like I am out of balance and disoriented ( can't feel my feet well) and the surroundings feel very different and weird
 

 for example the shop where I go regularly suddenly seems different /the road seems different ,wider /as if I am lost in space ..in general everything seems different and weird and I get dizzy and feel like falling on the ground .
 

 I feel better at home
 

 is it the same as derealization or something else ?and if u already have experience with dealing with it pls share your best tips"

"There seems to be two social extremes in my area and I've been struggling to navigate through them. I moved to the area for school due to my faith, but after some education, I learned that I have a few beliefs that didn't line up and I was unwilling to compromise. Since then, I've lost some close friends and chose to isolate myself. 
 

 After a few years I feel like I'm in an emotional spiral. I've failed in my romantic relationships and I'm stuck reflecting on how I got here. 
 

 I stopped going out after realizing that I would drink to cope, then became a pretty heavy smoker until I began experiencing some scary health issues. 
 

 Now, I'm working whenever I can and making myself available to coparent, but terrified at the idea of putting myself out there again to make friends. I love meeting new people and listening to outside perspectives. Of course, I get exhausted and love to run to a podcast/audiobook/physical book for comfort and relaxation. I just didn't expect for my social life to fall apart. 
 

 A lot of self sabotage and weak boundaries led me here and I'm picking up the pieces slowly. I have friends who I stay in contact with regularly online and have my sister who I can call when I just need to talk about something unimportant. Those interactions have been really awesome and I'm hoping I will be able to break out this funk and start going out and meeting people in real life again."
"Yesterday I started to obsess about my heart rate and in particular started to look for irregular heartbeats! Woke up this morning anxious and struggling with air hunger and I get tingly cause I'm probably hyperventilating. I saw a doctor last week cause I've been worrying about my heart and valves and noticable pulses. He took my pulse, BP (a bit high 160/82), my o2 (98) and listened to my heart beating. Said everything sounded normal and my rate was regular. But I've been obsessing trying to feel for irregulars in my wrist. How long does it take to measure dangerous irregular heart beats? Cause the doctor said I was fine after like a minute, maybe even less."
"Of taking Zoloft (Sertraline). I didn't need a Xanax today. I woke up, ""okay"". I didn't feel good but I didn't feel bad either. I was just okay. I'm still optimistic that I'll get to the good days."
"Long time anxiety sufferer here ( since 19) I am in early 30 s. I was on meds ( Buspiron Egis for only3 months and that is it )They helped me a bit and had no side effects
 

 I feel like I need help and get meds but I deal with dizziness so as I have read most anti anxiety meds cause dizziness and fatigue .I also have very mixed feelings about meds .Some people claim that meds are life \_saver and some people claim it made the anxiety even worse ( especially coming off meds seems scary experience )
 

 I feel like I need meds and sadly right now I do not live in the area where I can see psychiatrist soon ..but want to try it in future .but I am scared ...and the fact that I am emotionally alone to deal with this makes me feel even more vulnerable ..should I risk it or not ?what is your experience ?"

"I am 31 year old female working in tech industry. I have been dealing with stress and anxiety which started in grad school and has only gotten worse since then. It started with an incident with my advisor in grad school. I have been on and off on medicine and therapy but haven't been able to get control on it. In my current job which I joined two years ago, I had been doing well (even got promoted within a year), I started getting stressed out and having panic attacks before any meeting where I had to present my work or give updates. Slowly, I stopped having interest in my work.  
 After a lot of thinking, I decided to apply for another job with better work life balance and start afresh. I interviewed at got a job at my dream company and a big jump in my compensation. I felt so happy. 
 I am yet to inform my company as I need to go through immigration work before switching. So I need to continue working. I thought with this new job news I will feel more confident and less stressed but as soon as I get back to my work at my current company, I feel the same anxiety and stress. 
 I keep thinking if I don't have updates or I don't get good results from my experiments, what will others think. I didn't get work done this week, what will my team think. And this just becomes like a circle, makes me anxious and I can't focus.  
 I don't know what to do. My husband says, i won't be able to do well at the new job if this continues.
 

 I feel like I am a failure that I can't control my feelings and thoughts. I don't know what to do."
"Some days I think my job isn't so bad and I even enjoy it. But there's also always a sense that I'm not doing what I actually enjoy or something that gives me a sense of fulfillment.
 

 But do we even need to ""enjoy"" our jobs? Is the feeling of unfulfillment and being dissatisfied just my general anxiety?
 

 It doesn't help that overall my job has a lot of perks and pays fairly well. Besides the work itself everything else I feel positive about (the people, the flexibility, etc.) And of course even thinking about something as huge as a ""career change"" is terrifying.
 

 How do I know that the same thoughts won't just come back no matter what the job is?
 

 It also might be worth mentioning that I'm 30. 
 

 I appreciate anyone who can provide some insight or advice."

 I have a HUGE fear of doctors and medical settings since i had my son 4 years ago. I will go if I absolutely have too like I just did and my allergist check HR and it was so insanley high. She left the room and of course I had to check it and sure enough it was much lower.. I hate getting BP taken and heart rate.. Anyone else? I know exposure is the real key here but I GET SO INSANELY NERVOUS!!"

"I am 34M and I am having this obsessive fear of wetting myself without warning in any situation even at home for example if my friends come over I am afraid that I might leak and won't have any time to react before it's too late as it once happened in a similar way years ago when I came home after drinking night and was already almost sober then my friend noticed that I am leaking and I oddly haven't even felt it or noticed so I am afraid something like that can repeat in a mall, public or at home in a stressful or fight-or-flight situation even I have recently peed.. As far as I know I do not have bladder issues so is it even possible to pee myself without warning minutes after I have peed during stressful or uncomfortable situation ? I feel like my anxiety and thinking about it alone can make it happen rather than the stressful situations."
"So I'm in the throes of a prolonged health anxiety battle. First it was my heart (still is really but not as much) and now I'm onto diabetes. I sometimes get tingling in my fingertips sometimes on both hands, it's not painful or anything, just annoying. I'm of course worried it's neuropathy from diabetes since my diet hasn't been great in the last few years. 
 A doctor told me on here though that it isn't that and I felt better but everytime I feel it the dread comes back a bit.  
 Anyone else have this? It's often in all fingers but only in the pulp of the fingertip, not the whole tip itself."
"So because of being bullied for years, I racked up quite some sturdy self criticism. Being my own biggest bully is something I am very good at.
 

 Also I have this immense sense of right and wrong that racks me up with feelings of over-responsibility. So I am trying to figure out how to love myself.
 

 So many thing go through my head. In the end we are all just a product of our past and I don't believe we make a lot of conscious choises. What choises we make, what we do, how we think, are all a product of past circumstances. Then there is the apparent social hierarchy. How to love myself despite possibly being low on the social ladder, despite not having much or any control over my life. 
 

 Is that where unconditional self love comes in?"

"I plan a visit to a psychologist soon and ask her to prescribe medication and before that I want to research a medication which may be the best option for me 
 

 So far I have tried Buspirone which had no side effects but the effect was mild so I would like to try something stronger this time 
 

 so Ideally I want to try med which is easy to start and coming off it is not hard .Is it unrealistic ? :)"

So thanks to a number of different things doing stuff with my mom's family is anxiety inducing. I skipped Xmas Eve (most relaxed in over a decade) so I kind of feel obligated to go to Easter. For the record I'm 30 yrs now and still feel like I don't have much of a choice in going to these things. My bf basically told me that I can say no without giving a reason and that the gas + time is a waste. It's at my aunt/grandmother's house. I hate that I'm still trapped in the anxiety state my mom created when I was in middle school and feel the need to go just to keep the peace. Once my grandmother passes I'm going to stop going to stuff and I dread the conversation that will come up. My grandmother is still healthy for the most part but she is starting to show signs of dementia.
"Hi. I have health anxiety and lately I've been in a panic about my heart. Went to a doctor two weeks ago who listened to my heart and said everything sounded normal, my O2 is fine and my BP is a bit high 160/82 but he figured that was partially due to white coat syndrome. That was a great relief but since then I've been noticing my neck more and more and my pulse is visible from my carotids which has me freaked out about valve problems in my heart. But the doctor listened and didn't hear anything bad. 
 

 Does anyone else have pulsing like this in their necks? It's on both sidesand I also see under my chin pulsing when I look in a mirror while lying down."
"I am completely delusional, I think that young beautiful women genuinely are attracted to me, despite never having a girlfriend. No one has ever really qualified me as attractive. I work out and have a steady job. I think my personality is ugly and wretched. I fancied this attractive female worker at a recreation centre who is much younger than me. I mistakenly thought she gave a lingering stare. Years later every time I binge drink, I'm sending her creepy messages through instragram. I feel like a worthless piece of shit. My desperation is contributing to me compromising my principals. 
 

 This other young lady who is a barista, we exchange lingering glances. I try to engage in awkward small talk. I think that during our last interaction I said that her nail polish matches the colour of my shoes and suddenly flicked my foot up. She then for the rest of day ignored me and I suffered a near panic attack or some sort of emotional disregulation. I had to immediately leave work and tell my boss I felt nauseous, which I did. It felt as if somebody enviscerated my bowels and splayed my guts all over the place. When I reflect on everything, i realise I am undateable, unlovable and a nonhuman. They must be gaslighting me. I am nearing the end of trying. Sometimes life is just way too hard. I did not develop along life's standard pathways. I'm going increasingly insane with each passing day.
 

 I cannot build the nerve to ask women out. When I was 12 I asked out a girl and was rejected in a spectacularly humiliating way. Numerous other interactions have also contributed to it. This experience has largely mishaped my life, i might have ptsd from it. Everytime I try to build up the nerve to ask a woman out, I crumble and falter. I tell myself that I'm a living abortion who deserves not to be alive. As if my sexuality is oppressive.
 

 At work I feel 100% paranoid after I tried the same shit of creepily talking to a female coworker. She forwarded the findings to a HR and it resulted in me getting chris hansoned. I was asked to attend meeting with an obnoxios HR twat who printed physical copies of my messages. I said that I was ashamed etc and deeply sorry. Also since im a shy guy I should ask him for help asking out somone. I said disregard the messages and I do not wish to pursue any relationship with her. She worked in another department for 1 month. I think either the HR person circulated the material or she did throughout the organisation. Now my existence is heavily stigmatised. I hate my job due to the toxic work environment. I am so paranoid that everytime somebody laughs in HR that I am the source of their amusement. Working alongside this younger woman and another one. i have to moderate my behaviour around them.
 

 The only reason I was hired is because I am a double KPI, I have indigenous blood and a psychological disability. I am completely unsupported at work. My only real advocate is my mother who makes me lunch in order for me to attend work."
"I feel like crawling out of a cave where I've been trapped for so long. Just have to get up at 5 am and share it with the world
 

 **TL;DR:**
 

 I was a bullied introverted loser with low self-esteem and believed depression is something I will never escape.
 

 I didn’t believe I can have any confidence because 1) I thought confidence was based on past success but I believed all my success was worthless 2) I didn’t have a support system that will support and love me unconditionally, which would give me that natural confidence. Not from parents, friends or other close relationships.
 

 I found my support system from strangers who I met in an online speaking improvement group that celebrates small challenges. I found confidence and this is life-changing for me, and this may work for you. Find your own tribe that you can fall back on. One thing that’s extremely important is to stop complaining and whining and take action on what you can change.
 

 \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

 **The whole thing:**
 

 I (32M) grew up as a quiet, introverted kid. I had a stutter which I was bullied for until high school. My parents divorced when I was 12 and I blamed myself for it. My mother even agreed with me on that in public. I was repeatedly told I'll be **""useless like your father""** and all my awards and achievements were nothing compared with **“Emily's son went to Stanford on full scholarship, works at Google and bought a big house at 24 ”.** **Probably because of all these, I was emotionally sensitive and socially awkward.**
 

 In class projects and clubs, I was always the quiet one in the corner with no voice. Never had close friends. So many times I was on the brink of tears in class because I didn’t have a “buddy” or teammates till the last minute. I would also have difficulty breathing or just completely break down before or during presentations because of the stress, and spend time alone in the restroom during lunch break for days.
 

 In college I learned that my grandmother and my father both had prolonged depression. That’s when I believed this thing is also in my blood, my DNA, something like a curse that I could never get rid of. I decided never to have children, because who would pass the seeds of agony and never-ending internal suffering to another innocent child?!
 

 When girls approached me, I thought they were trying to make fun of me. I did not believe that I had intrinsic value, that I was an interesting, valuable, lovable person. But at the same time, I so wanted to be cared for, accepted and loved. I just didn't know how to be ok with myself and be happy.
 

 **People said that I need to be more confident about myself. Before, I thought confidence came from past success. But my successes have never been recognized as successes, by myself or others (i.e. my mother). Even if I succeeded, so what? I’m destined to be a depressed loser. It’s in my blood!**
 

 **Then I read somewhere in a book that says, confidence does not come from the sense of achievement. True confidence comes from the belief that no matter how big a mistake you've made, you are always loved and supported unconditionally. ""Naturally confident"" people got their confidence from their parents, friends or other close relationships.**
 

 **Well, this new definition made so much sense!**
 

 **But so what? I had none of those: loving parents, intimate relationships, or true friends. Parents, I don't have control over them, that's done and over. For the latter two, it's kind of a chicken and egg problem. I was well in my 20s with 0 self-esteem, chronic depression and self-destructive thoughts. How do I get true friends and intimate relationships with that? They won't fall into my lap?**
 

 **I didn't have an answer.**
 

 My confidence was further destroyed in my job search. The interview feedback was always **""not a good fit""** although most of the time I was overqualified. Worst still was when I learned someone without the skillset but who had the **""energy""** was hired instead. I even started faking that ""energy"" thing, but no attempt worked.
 

 I finally landed a job after two years of soul-crushing job search. This turned me into a total sucker at work who dare not to say no to colleagues, or speak up or stand up for myself, and I was a complete doormat to my manager. I was still quiet and voiceless in the meetings and gatherings. Then came the ugly office politics. I was quickly isolated and helpless, exhausted every day, physically and mentally. It was like high school all over again.
 

 Covid brought me two years of more isolation. In the beginning I kind of enjoyed it, then came the burnout and loneliness. So I started to blindly join some online social groups, some good some bad. I kept going to different ones.
 

 I bumped into this online group on Meetup. It's for people who want to improve confidence and public speaking. Each time, a small group of 10 or so would join an online meeting, everyone's given a different question, and you are expected to speak for one minute without preparation. What's special is the questions. These are some whacky, funny, off-the-wall questions that you've never expected to answer in real life. *""You cry diamonds. Tell us about your day""; ""What is your favourite geometric shape and why?""; ""You are trying to sell your haunted house to a developer. What is your pitch?""; ""How could carousels be spiced up so they are more exciting?"" A*fter some Um and Ahs, the most unexpected and hilarious answers came out, and after that, people can comment or give their own versions of answers.
 

 I was hooked since the first meeting. It's with all strangers from all over the globe and they are some of the nicest people I've met. I did practise speaking, but one minute at a time. If I screw up, that's screw up just for one minute, in front of total strangers that have no effect on me in real life, no big deal. No one would isolate me because of it. And who would judge you because your screw up your speech on *""how do you use your superpower of transforming people into toddlers""?*
 

 And all the people there are kind of like me, suck at being confident, speaking in public, holding a normal conversation, suck at being themselves, and want some comfortable fun social interaction during this mass isolation. There are no dominant schmoozers you see here and there in the workplace that you secretly hate but can do nothing about. The egality is in that 1 minute per person per round setup. Each person from time to time screws up their own speech, but that's ok. Everyone exchanges their own bad jokes, laugh it off and move on.
 

 I started to get good at it and couldn't help going back time after time, 5 days a week. I feel relaxed and natural there, or put another way, **""comfortably exposed""**. Somehow we formed friendships, playing virtual board games like Mafia together every week, even sharing life stories and vulnerable moments.
 

 I started to see changes in me because of this sort of repeated exposure, or conditioning. 4 months into this, now when I talk to strangers, I no longer have the baggage of wondering what they are thinking of me. It's not always about me, no one's got the time and attention all on me and I have nothing to lose. They are just people, who could potentially be friends, who might also screw up their one-minute speech on *""A completely wrong reason why your voice sounds better in the shower""*. There are moments when they are good and bad, just like in the speech events. If I want to be friends, I gotta accept their good and bad.
 

 In company meetings, I started to feel more at ease and assured. I can't believe I even dare to throw in jokes when appropriate. I noticed my voice is firmer, I talk slower, and my body is more expanded and not restrained like before. My colleagues were amazed at my change and asked if I was in love. ""Yeah, kind of!"", I replied.
 

 What's more important is that now I believe I can change. It builds confidence in me not only in speaking in public, in interacting with strangers, **but also in that I can fight something that's even in my blood.** As long as I want to fight the battle, I know I'm not alone. I sort of have this dilutional idea that I can do it and it will have a positive result.
 

 One day I bumped into this paragraph about **confidence, about unconditional love and support**. It was like an epiphany to me. This is it. I think I've found my unconditional support, from strangers. No matter how I screw up I'm loved and supported. And being not as good as others is ok, failed at something is ok, getting negative feedback from someone is ok. It's just normal, temporary, and not necessarily bad! Just like those one-minute meetings that goes day after day, week in week out, as long as I don’t end my own life like my grandma, I still have opportunities and time to improve and become better, and **a bunch of strangers will support me on that!**
 

 So if you are struggling, in anyway, you feel weak, lonely, powerless, unconfident, find a group where people who fail in life in a similar way as you do and you all want to improve, you are all in this together. Not the groups where you complain and whine together all day. Not the ones people tout themselves and just show off. Try different things until you find the right group, **your tribe**, take a leap of faith. This worked for me. Hope this will also work for you.
 

 **One more thing I’d like to talk about: Just take action**. It is important to have a community, great if you find a good one, but please don't take it simply as a tree hole.
 

 Introversion and social awkwardness make you feel powerless and hopeless? You need to vent and complain from time to time? If it's something cathartic for you, it's all good. But don't just end there, because it doesn't solve any problem. If you don't take action on it no one will come and stand up for you, no one will solve the problem for you. This month next year you'll still be complaining about the same thing but no problems solved, just like I did bitterly for years and years.
 

 Blaming it on fate, on destiny, on heredity, on your parents, or anything you cannot change will only drag you lower and deeper. You gotta work on the things you can change, which is yourself. **Please, PLEASE believe this is something you can work on and change.** I want to kick myself in the ass for spending such a long time on whining and self-loathing.
 

 You feel it's hard and uncomfortable? Any personal growth or change is and will be uncomfortable. It's difficult for everyone. Trust me, those extroverts have their own shit to deal with. Everyone has their own battle to fight, no one is an exception. So please, take action!
 

 Hope this thing can help someone. Have a nice day!

 Thank you all for the kind words!
 

 The impromptu speaking group is called **""The Mouthfuls""**. You can google and find them on discord and meetup. I'm not affiliated with them, just want to share this resource. Good luck!"
How do I just accept this condition and the limitations it will probably bring throughout the rest of my life?

why are so many people so skeptical about it ? It's like most people are scared when they hear this word ..why ? I do not get it ..It 's just a myth that they make people addicted and fat and even more depressed? .I am going to start meds and I am already very anxious bc I try to research and google about meds and most people totally hate antidepressants and anti anxiety meds ...and this attitude makes me  feel very anxious

"I thought I would be child free but. I am worried now that I won’t have anyone when my parents die. I also never thought about having children but I am starting to feel that I want to experience motherhood but I am worried and scared of pregnancy, getting fat and hating myself. My marriage falling apart, not being a good mother. Countless negative scenarios has made me all depressed and anxious. Wanting to not live …I feel like I was in a bubble and now I’m facing future and life."
"I've been in constant pain off and on for WEEEKS, SOME DAYS I wake up and I feel fine till the end of the day, and others I just hurt all fucking day everywhere on my Body, the pain moves around sometimes too and it happens even when I don't feel anxious. Yesterday I was fine when I was around my family for Easter, I was a little sore but not to ache and pins and needley. My doctor keeps telling me it's my anxiety flaring up. But im always worried. I have an Xray tomorrow and I'm supposed to have a CT Scan (Waiting on my insurance) to find out if I'm gonna have to pay out of pocket or they'll pay for it. But it fuckin sucks so bad. I feel so broken. It's getting to the point where I'm really discouraged to do certain things. I don't want this I don't want any of it. 
 

 Anyways. So yeah I guess I'm just trying to find some support, I know I'm probably crazy and rediculous and I'm probably making myself worse and doing this to myself.
 

 Also Dr. GOOGLE fucking sucks with how close He is to my hands."
"About two months ago I had an incident with a low battery alarm on my carbon monoxide detector. I was listening to the beeps because it wasn't constant, I would check the alarm and it wouldn't give any indication of anything. While I was staring at the device it beeped again and gave the ""LB"" indication. At that moment I went into a state of dread and fear that I have never felt before. Instantly started to panic, checked on my kids to make sure they were breathing and spent the rest of the night in utter fear of death and loosing control. The next day I noticed that my depression was completely gone but it was replaced by high anxiety. I have had clinical depression my entire life starting when I was very young like around 5 years old, I am 32 now. Once the incident happened, I felt completely disassociated from my body and the world around me with constant panic attacks, the longest panic attack lasting a little over four hours.
 

 On top of all of that I have become ultra sensitive to medication, especially anti-anxiety medication. The only medication that seems to be helping throughout the day is vyvanse. I did one of those gene test to identify which medications I should try and which meds I should stay away from. I only had one med that was on the green tab, pristiq. I tried it, but on the second day I ended up getting a panic attack that morphed into a couple of symptoms that I never experienced, I got a metallic taste in my mouth and my body instantly went cold starting from my feet and traveling up. I ended up in the ER with either some strange side effects or serotonin syndrome, they wouldn't tell me for sure.
 

 Its been about two months and my depression is still gone, but my anxiety is still sky high. Every medication I try makes things worse. I am desperately trying to figure out why I switched so suddenly, it doesn't make any sense. I have an MRI tomorrow to make sure I don't have anything serious wrong like a tumor. 
 

 I can not find anything through my internet research that closely resembles my sudden switch from depression to anxiety. I am reaching out to see if anyone else has had this happen to them and what the outcome was. I feel so alone; it has even stumped my doctors."

"Had a CT Scan of my Chest today, not sure if they scanned anything else, they just said Chest CT, but I've been complaining to my Doctor about Pains in my chest which she thinks is Costochondritis from inflammation also she thinks its my anxiety thats out of hand ive had blood work done last year from my Primary and this year at the hospital all came back good except my LDL cholesterol levels, and more recently Pinching pain just under my left armpit just by my ribs, and aching and pinching all over the rest of my body. The pain seems to Relieve if I'm distracted or standing. It just fucking sucks, I also do combat sports like Jiu Jitsu so I'm also worried I fucked something up in my back, but I have a referral to a neurologist. I paid out of pocket for my CT scan today because I wasn't sure my insurance was going to approve it, and they want me to do physical therapy first so I kind of gave them the finger with that I think and paid. The last thing I wanna do is physical therapy when I don't even know if there's an internal issue going on. In would I put myself in more strenuous activity, only to mess something else up without first doing a scan to make sure?..
 

 Seems backwards to me. 
 

 I sit all day for work to, so I'm sure it's possible its a posture problem also. Either way my anxiety goes through the roof over it. My hands hurt which could also be carpal tunnel from typing and using my mouse all day for. Work. I'm 31 and this absolutely fucking sucks.
 

 I'm probably nervous for no reason though and my anxiety is causing all this BS for the last 2 or 3 months."
"Half the time I feel like I'm not even anxious or stressed. My heart rates seem normal everything seems fine. But is it still possible to be stressed and have active anxiety without realizing it or feeling like you are?
 

 I struggle a lot coming to terms with this."
"I've been slightly overweight for several years and over the past year or so I've gone on a few diets and managed to lose a bit. I'm now around 81 kilos, was around 93 at my max. I've lost four or so kilos in the past month or month and a half maybe. I've been reducing portions and overeating less and cut down on snacking between meals, also been taking walks and some mild exercises. 
 This is what I'm doing to help improve my life but I always get anxious when I start to lose weight quickly cause I start to wonder if it's cause of a disease..........
 

 Does anyone else get like this when they lose weight even when they're trying to lose the weight?"
"They just parked their bikes outside and ordered food, they're being loud and having fun.
 

 They have more independence and skills than me despite being like 10 yo olds.
 

 The envy is just too much at this point"
"I tried it yesterday and the only effect that it did was making me sleepy for 20minutes after 1.5hours from the assumption. It didn't really make me feel normal as other people claim it does, maybe the dosage is too low but I'll need to se the psychiatrist again.
 

 The thing is that after 5 hours I had a brief moment when I felt like I was feeling a bit like freaking out/panicky for no reason. 30 min later I felt generally not good, like when you eat a lot at dinner and you fight to not throw up and you end up feeling shivers and a bit sick.
 

 Is this supposed to happen or those two symptoms I experienced later are just a coincidence?"
"I have symptoms of anxiety : derealization, panic ,fear of leaving home ,dizziness and blurry vision,I find it hard to leave home

"I'm really getting drained. I'm starting to feel 0 interest in anything I normally like doing, depression if you will I guess. I've been in Physical Pain all over my body, like pins and needles, hands and other extremities ache etc, for WEEKS maybe even months. Not always constant, some days I feel alright with little pain others it's constant.
 

 It's driving me insane. I just had a CT Scan of my Chest 2 days ago but the results are not in yet 
 

 I'm worried there's something physically wrong with me at this point. Last year the doctor ran blood tests a full panel and everything turned out fine... but this year it's gotten worse last year it was just my chest hurting.
 

 I am waiting on my referral for the neurologist to call me but I haven't heard back yet. 
 

 I'm so scared at this point cause this whole thing is taking forever. Last time I got depressed I took off with my Firearm and my wife had to hunt me down where she found me like 4 cities over. I'm scared to because if I do that again she's probably goint to leave me. I just want some help :(. I've talked her ear off so much about my health anxiety already I can't do it anymore."
"I don't know what I'm doing with this post but I'm 31 years old and going through a bit of a a phase right now, idk what to call it, probably depression. 
 

 I don't want to spill the life story right now but I've been thinking a lot about my childhood lately and the challenges I've had and still have. 
 

 I just wanted to share that when I was in school, I literally never talked to anyone there. I went home and was talkative (until around 16 when the depression started). But at school I would not talk to anyone. Silent and alone in my shell/hell for years. I was so scared of other kids. I had no idea how to make friends or start a conservation. I was way too shy to ever do that. I would walk around the hallways at lunch if I could, sit at table of kids that I would never talk to, or just find anywhere I could be (bathrooms not excluded). It was absolutely terrifying, exhausting and painfully lonely. I just wanted a friend, someone to talk to, just like the other kids had...but I never did. I was ""quiet boy"" ""the kid who never talks"" and at one point ""stare boy"". Periodically kids would ask me if i was gonna bring a gun to school. Sometimes they would ask me ""just talk...say anything"" like I was a zoo animal. I would occasionally respond with saying the word ""anything"" and that's it. All of that was extremely hurtful and just made everything worse, I felt all their words. It was a terribly lonely childhood and adolescence. I felt like I was the shyest person ever. I felt like I didn't have something that everyone else had and it wasn't fair. It felt like i was just floating through life as the world turned around me. No one saw me suffering and I couldn't say anything.
 

 Anyway, adulthood eventually got better when my life took a drastic turn. I don't want to give the story but let's just say the universe threw me a bone and a huge hole was filled around 23. But it seems I have some unhealed wounds from childhood that have come back to haunt me during this depression.
 

 I found this subreddit and just wanted to put a small bit of me out there for the first time. I want to know if anyone else suffered like this growing up. I've never met anyone as social anxious as me, especially as a child. I just want to know that you exist and I hope you're doing okay and I'm really sorry if you're not. Social anxiety and whatever else I have is hell."
I always have this feeling of failure like i wont be able to pay my bills i had to get a new car and the thought of the commitment to a car payment scares the hell out of me now im worried if i can make the payments i cant eat or sleep but the thing is i can make the payments i just get this feeling like im going to fail
"Hello all - I am a 33F and my partner 37M, has struggled with anxiety, depression, and OCD for most of his life. We have been together for about 8 months and I’ve really seen over the past 2 months or so, him really struggling with his anxiety over changing medication dosage (tried decreasing Zoloft due to zero libido and severely backfired). I am a mental health professional but in my personal life, it feels like a whole other story. I’m trying to be supportive and do the right things for my partner but sometimes it’s so challenging.
 

 The recent holiday turned into an entire anxiety then depressive episode of him taking too many Ativan and mixing alcohol and us calling off everything. It honestly scared me, and I don’t know how to express that without making anything worse and him feeling more anxious and embarrassed about it.
 

 Any advise or resources I can look into and read would be helpful. Thanks!"

"So today omw to work, I’m cruising on the highway, sun is shining, windows down,music on, hair blowing in the wind and because it was a long drive and I was running late) I decided to drive in the fast lane. It was light traffic and in more of a country area so it was acceptable. 
 My mind was full of random and unnecessary thoughts as usual, when all of a sudden, a bird comes out of left field almost ground level. It was flying diagonal and attempted to fly upward and across the front of my car. It was almost as if it happened in slow motion: It was inches away from making it across safely when BAM it hit the right side of my windshield. If I had been going just a little slower, I think it would have made it. I could not believe it happened and I instantly became hysterical. Im not a crier per say but I cried so hard and felt so bad that I should have pulled over to compose myself. Instead: My husband just so happened to call right as this all happened and I couldn’t even speak clearly to explain what was wrong. Once I finally told him: he (as usual) made me feel stupid for crying and told me to stop feeling bad about it. He’s not emotionally supportive whatsoever. Never has been. Long story short: I can’t even talk about it without tearing up and feeling so guilty. It really broke my heart. I’ve never in my life (33f) ever had something like this happen to me. I feel so freakin bad. Everyone keeps telling me “It’s just a bird” or “omg, your crying over that?” But to me it’s way deeper tthan that. I will admit that it’s a relief to have emotion and feelings again but unfortunate that they have to be sad/guilt feelings. Now I just need to figure out how to feel happiness/excitement (not about this situation of course) but general. Anyways, I just needed to get this off of my chest and see others perspective. Thanks for reading 🤍"

"Hello all I am a(33m) and I am not really sure how to start this other then to say that my anxiety(undiagnosed?) has ruined my life I have no friends left, I have been on/off homeless for a large portion of my life, I have no life skills, I am afraid to leave my home and I think I have come to a breaking point I am having very intense bursts of suicidal ideation and crying at random times over seemingly random things.  
 

 

 I am not really sure what I want from this and I can't seem to push myself to write up the massive story it would take to explain some of the possible causes for this I am just really scared and sad right now and i don't have a support network and it is \*very\* hard for me to go outside as it just makes me shut down out of fear and I am probably going to be homeless again due to this issue as it is causing issues with me being able to pay my rent and bills and I feel terrible saddling my little brother (my roommate atm) with my problems.  
 

 

 Can anyone recommend any resources that may help or at least push me to seek treatment? It is all becoming too much for me now my health is terrible, my hygiene is the same, my teeth are ruined, I haven't talked to anyone that isn't my few relations i am on good terms with in years im so fkn lonely I just want it all to end.  
 

 

 I am willing to answer any questions no matter how hard they are especially if you think it will help."

"I'm going nuts! I keep finding new spots where I see my pulse! It's in my abdomen, chest, neck and now I'm seeing it just below my clavicles! Both of them.  
 I've talked to few people on here that can see their pulses on their abdomen and chest, but is anyone seeing theirs or feeling theirs very clearly just below their clavicles?  
 I'm 33 and worried that I have heart disease! I shouldn't be having those worries for another 20-30 years!"
"Hi all. Im 33M and I tested positive on COVID two days ago (really pale 2nd line on home test) and today at doctor (instant confirmation). I had a mild fever yesterday, 37.8°C was highest measured. I still have a dry caugh, some eye pain, mild aches. I am double vaxxed (2nd dose was a year ago). I am having some chest tightness, and even though i measure my blood oxy on my samsung watch 4 and is always around 97-98% so far, i am panicking like mad. Ive read stuff about covid taking turn for worse after first mild symptoms are over. I am drinking lots of fluids, but having trouble sleeping cause i worry too much i might not wake up or wake up in one hell of a covid day. I think my vaccines are expired now and im gonna have a really hard time with covid. Well, truth to be told, i'm thinking im about to die, but thats probably my panic. 
 

 Im not even sure what day of covid im at, since my daughter was sick a week ago, but wasnt tested by our doc, then my wife caught it and was tested positive on friday. Im also afraid of hospitals, since i always thought people that end up there due to covid and less likely to survive it and thats fueling my panic even more.
 

 So, am I gonna die? Or gonna laugh about it in few days?"
"Hi everyone. This is my first use of reddit and making a post. My name is Eliko and I'm 32. I am a mechanical engineer by profession and works as business line manager in an international company. I have successful career and I do not have money problem. However, I am struggling with anxiety and panic attacks sometimes. Sometimes, I feel like i am going to have a heart attack. This makes me so uncomfortable. I have some assets and money in the bank no ones knows and i don't want to tell anyone. However, when I have panic attack i wish i had very trustful one to tell about everything I have. This would make me a little calm. Is it only me or everyone who has same feeling with me? Please help."
"I tried 0.25mg (maybe not enough) but it just made me sleepy after 1h30m from the assumption.  
 I noticed that it felt a bit like it turned down the activity of the brain in terms of thoughts, I think I lost the train of thought a bunch of times but nothing bad, it's not that I was braindead or such.
 

 The problem is that it didn't really shut down the hyperawareness and it still felt a bit fucked to think about my face or stuff like that."
"So my CT Scan results came back and my Doctor wants to schedule an appointment to discuss the results with me. I couldn't even get them to give me the results on the phone. Appointment is tomorrow at 9:30am 
 

 I'm going to have a fucking panic attack.
 

 Does this happen? And she's just gonna tell me their normal?. If they are normal why can't they just tell me over the phone. Why schedule an appointment?.
 

 Now I'm worried there's something wrong with me."

I was recently prescribed 20mg fluoxetine and hydroxyzine for panic disorder with agoraphobia. I've always been iffy about medications but after a quick Google search I'm flat out scared to take them. I know every person has different effects but are there any success stories with this combo or is it all bad? I guess my main fear is the possibility of the fluoxetine increasing my anxiety and in what kind of way.
"It's always something, as soon as I start to get out of a scare another one starts......
 

 I had my BP taken today at the pharmacy. Tonight I noticed I have few lines of petechiae on my upper arm where the cuff was placed. She did both arms and I have it on both, very little on my right arm though. 
 

 Of course I'm now worried if I have leukemia.....even though I have no other symptoms of that. 
 

 Has anyone else gotten this?

"Hi everyone, I (34m) have stage 4 cancer and lately it has been causing me to have liquid surround my lungs. I have a drain that I can drain the fluid daily but sometimes when I get worked up I get extremely anxious and almost pass out from not being able to breathe even though my pulseox is in the 90’s. Does anyone have any quick breathing or quick exercises I can do once I start getting worked up? Also, if I took Xanax regularly so you think that would help? 
 

 Any help would be greatly appreciated :)"
"I hope this post does not go against community standards 
 

 right now I am really confused because asked my doctor to prescribe meds which are easy to quit and she presecribed Effexor ( I googled it at home and I do not want to start it after the reviews) 
 

 I tried Buspiron before and had mild effect but 0 side effects but not great result 
 

 I want to decrease my anxiety but I do not want to suffer from side effects and withdrawal symptoms 
 

 please share your experiences"
"Usually the only thing I've found online or that the therapist told me is all on the lines of ""what are the consequences of this?"" or ""what are you exactly scared about?"".
 

 But I don't find them really useful because the answer usually is something lik ""the consequence is that I don't wanna go through the symptoms again"" or ""I'm not scared OF anything tbh, I just am""
 

 Does anyone have some tips when facing symptoms?"
"so I saw a psychiatrist yesterday ( the whole visit to a hospital was a horror story\_ I live in developing country) 
 

 she prescribed Buspar 15 mg ( which is good for me since I have no side effects) and she added Effexor in small doses 37,5 and she will double the dose soon ..here is the problem I have no support system and I read many horror stories about the drugs ..If my anxiety gets worse I need to stay sober and think straight and seems like this drug may complicate things for me .
 

 all I did today was google and I feel anxious and panic hits every time ..I need someone to advise me 
 

 I asked her to prescribe meds with mild side effects and easy to come off and google says it is serious antidepressants to come off .so quitting won't be easy .plus I wanted to take something for 3 months since I am not very tolerant with meds 
 

 I feel so lost and confused ...I have wasted so much money and energy ,is it ok if I call her tomorrow and ask her for ,,,easier '' meds ? which will be easy to quit and won't have serious side effect ? 
 

 for a proof : Buspar had 0 side effects for me and it is easy to quit but sadly not strong enough for me"

"I am a person who believes in meds and medicine in general .I got vaccinated as soon as I could and take my flu shots regularly .so when people claimed that anti anxiety meds may harm you I was very skeptical about their opinions and believed in medicine ...I have taken buspiron in the past and it had mild effect and had no side effects 
 

 Now I decided to give meds a try since my anxiety got severe and the doctor prescribed effexor  
  37,5 which she claims is mild and easy to get off ...but after reading reviews I am already in panic ...I took only one pill and had horrible side effects ..now I UNDERSTAND why so many people hated anxiety meds 
 

 are there any meds which really work but do not make u suffer and do not make u regret your choice of taking antidepressants ? I can name buspar but I need soemthing stronger combined with it 
 

 I am so sad and confused right now"

 It's a long read!
  
 Just having a period of self reflection and wanted to write my thoughts down. 
 

 I have had anxiety all of my life (it feels like). I developed emetophobia when I was 5 years old. This shaped every experience I had throughout childhood. I was the strange child who didn’t have many friends. I didn’t like going to parties, going on days away, going on coach rides with school etc etc. These would all set off panic attacks at the fear that someone would be ill. Every aspect of my life was touched by my emetophobia. It controlled where I went, what I did, what I ate, what I watched. I felt like I had to control everything. I also had periods of OCD like behavior. If I didn’t read XYZ, I’d be sick. If I wore a certain colour, I’d be sick.
 

 It came to a head when I was 15. It was during the school holidays and I just couldn’t face the outside world. If I was in the living room, I shut the curtains all the time in case I saw someone be ill outside. I had a 6 week course of CBT to help with this which improved things massively for me. I was by no means cured, but I could write the word out now. I looked at cartoons of people getting ill. Don’t get me wrong, I was sobbing and shaking by the end of it but I did it. Things slightly improved for me. I even went out drinking in clubs when I was 18 and went for meals out, things I didn’t think I’d be able to do. 
 

 As I was the odd kid, I was bullied. This started from an early age where I was told I was ugly and a tramp. We didn’t have a lot of money when I was a kid so I wore second hand clothes most of the time, which was of course picked up by the other kids. From the age of about 10 to 16, I was told I was ugly pretty much every day at school. They had awful names for me based on my features which still hurt me this day. I had one ‘friend’ who sat in a classroom and said in front of everyone “ don’t you feel sorry for AprilBelle08? She’s so ugly, she’ll never go on a date. No one will ever love her’. This happened when I was 15 and I can only just talk about it now. To no-one’s surprise, I developed body dysmorphia. I was only diagnosed with this last year but I’m pretty sure I’ve had it since I was around 12. This part is hard for me to talk about as I have only recently sought help. 
 

 Up until last year, I used to cry myself to sleep about how fat and ugly I was. I would spend hours pulling every feature on my face to bits. I got together with my husband when I was 22 (we had been friends for years) and the fear I felt letting him see me completely. I wore make up every time we were together for months. I developed a fear of social situations because I could just feel that everyone was looking at how ugly I was. I felt like people wouldn’t take me seriously at work due to my looks. I hated (and still do in fairness) having my photo taken. I would take pictures of myself in the morning and zoom in on my problem areas. 
 This led to another event, in the Summer of 2020. My husband walked in and I was curled up heaving and sobbing about how ugly I was. I couldn’t face going back into the world now that lockdown was easing up, I couldn’t bear people to see me. I imagined that people everywhere were looking at me. I’m a regular gym goer and I was so scared that people were staring at me with how ugly I was. My whole life, I’ve worn cardigans and scarves to hide my body, even when it’s the hottest day of the year (of course I now realise that this is what causes people to look at me). After this episode, I thought, I’ve got to get help. I can’t live my life walking on eggshells because I’m so scared of what I look like. At this point, I had increased my dose of my anxiety medication (I have generalized anxiety disorder but that’s another story). 
 

 I reached out to our local CBT services. It was a 7 month wait before I got to speak to a therapist. They were also all done on Zoom due to Covid. 
 

 I won’t go into loads of detail on this post as I have already rambled on. But the difference I feel in myself has been immeasurable. I told my therapist that she had changed my life, and she said it was all me. I had to put 100% effort in before I could start making changes. 
 

 The main point of this post really is to say how proud I am of myself. If my 15 year old self could see me, she wouldn’t believe how things can improve. The girl that was so ugly that she couldn’t leave the house is happily married to a husband who loves her. But importantly, I feel better about myself. I know I’m not conventionally attractive. But who is conventionally attractive? To use the old adage, I’ve truly learned that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Who gets to decide who is ugly? Don’t get me wrong, I have bad days where I feel so ugly that I’m scared to leave the house. But I no longer take pictures of myself and constantly scrutinize how ugly I am. I can look in a mirror. I wore a dress today for my big birthday. I haven’t dressed up for my birthday since I was about 18 years old. I’m realizing that looks (or lack of) isn’t the be all and end all. 
 

 I wanted to share this post as a kind of letter to my 15 year old self, and to share with everyone that it can get better. I honestly wasn’t sure I would make it to 30 years old without having a breakdown. I genuinely thought that I would become agoraphobic because how could I go out looking like I do? 
 

 If you have read this far, thank you for your attention. Please seek help if it is needed and most of all, keep going. Things can get better."
"I have severe anxiety ,I had taken meds in the past when my anxiety was severe ,I guess they were mild meds bc they had minimal side effects and the result was not great but still had a progress.
 

 I decided to take meds because my anxiety got severe this month and have 2 questions .
 

 1) How long should we take antidepressants ? believe me or not I quit my meds after 3 months and had no side effects so I had no idea that on average a person has to take antidepressants for 6 months ?
 

 2) are there any short term anxiety meds ? for example imagine the scenario : a person gets better soon and is ready to quit meds after 2 months ....is it possible ?
 

 3) also I wonder does every person with anxiety and phobia needs antidepressants ???
 

 I have anxiety,phobias but I am not very depressed ,I mean I am not the most cheerful person ever but I am not sad ...IS MEDS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPRESSED ???
 

 AND 4) I have discovered that most meds have horrible side effects ? why ? are not there meds which help us but do not make us like zombie ?"

"I (33F) have been seeing this man (41M) since last November. So far everything is going great and we mutually expressed that we like each other and spending time with each other.
 

 He has been traveling every few weeks to attend a few friend's weddings. Every time he comes back we make plans to see each other. He always tells me his stories on his trips and shows me pictures of who he hangs out with. I can now pretty much recall his friends and family's names now. He recently came back this week from a trip to meet his best friend. 
 

 After telling me all the details and the people he met he tells me he was thinking of moving out there since everything is much closer, friendlier, and the weather is sunnier. His work gives him the option of working in two locations at the same time now that he had worked there for a few years. He was thinking of traveling back and forth from here and there. 
 

 After hearing this my anxiety creep up. This isn't the first, there was this one time a month back when he was out of the country when I thought to myself ""he deserves better, why is he with me? Or with all the people he is meeting, he's going to be introduce to someone better."" 
 

 He then tells me coming back here ""feels gloomy"" or maybe I'm on a vacation high but the happiness moment is seeing [me]."" That last words reassured me for a bit but I can't help something is off. 
 

 The thing is we are not official yet. I've been thinking of how to bring this up but I fear I'm going to be rejected. He lives a very active lifestyle and I'm still studying for a board exam and being confident in my own skin. He gives me space to study too and keeps checks on me.
 

 After we were passionate and spending the night together, I woke up, held on to him and just cried. He noticed it and asked, ""what's wrong?"" All I could say is, ""I don't want to leave for work."" My mind on the other hand was repeating, ""what ever happens between us, please stay apart of my life, you're the only good part of my life right now."" 
 

 I had bad experiences in the past were partners would say ""this is not going anywhere, I'm not looking for anything serious, you have anxiety or you can't give a B***j**.""
 

 He knows my anxiety, my past experiences, communication issues and he stills hangs out with me. He has been open, honest, caring, attentive, affectionate, and nice. I like him very much and so does he, but I fear it will end soon but I don't want it to. I'm happy when I'm with him and we can spend hours with each other.
 

 I just scared of losing a person that has been good."
